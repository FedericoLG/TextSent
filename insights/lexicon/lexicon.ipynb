      "Boarded my English Mastiff here over New Year's.  They're closed on Sunday, so even though we got home on Sunday, we had to leave him here another day (and pay for another day) because we couldn't pick him up until Monday morning.  He got a complimentary bath with his boarding.  When I did pick him up, once I got him in the car I noticed a very pungent, musky odor.  Couldn't figure out what it was until I got him home the smell was so bad I had to leave the car windows open to air it out.  He had a greenish \"material\" on the underside of his tail and around his butt.  I tried to clean it off.  Let him outside and he had watery diarrhea.  I called them and asked why the stinky green stuff wasn't noticed by their groomer.  They said he did notice it and figured he had \"rolled in something\".  They didn't clean it all off and sent him home that way.  It was anal gland secretions, and I'm thinking why a groomer, working at a veterinary hospital wouldn't recognize that and go grab a tech somewhere (they're all over the place) to have them take a look.  I had to bring my poor dog all the way back over there, making me late for work, for something they never should've sent him home with.  They did express his anal glands, but brought him out to me still stinky and leaving oily green stuff where he was sitting in their lobby.  I asked the gal behind the counter \"what is this\", she tried to tell me it was soap.  I asked for a tissue and wiped it up, showed it to her and asked \"does this look like soap?  Would you like to tell me if you think it smells like soap?\"  They AGAIN took him back and cleaned him off.  Then prescribed anti-diarrheal medication as they noticed he had bad diarrhea while he was back there.  I will never board my dog here again.\n"

She placed the tip on and started to cut them and then said a different girl would finish and left her sitting there. I don't mind that u needed to leave early she should have just waited for someone to complete the job one time. As I got up from the nail dryer I saw her siting there and asked what's going on. The nail tech next to her said she would finish as soon as she was done with the job she was doing but didn't and started on a pedicure. Meanwhile my sister has been waiting at least 15 min meanwhile the guy there was going to start on someone else when he noticed that she needed to have her nails finished. So he took her and finished them and then she has to go to a third person for the paint and design. \n",

I don't mind  waiting just don't have us sit down and then wait for someone to come finish the job. I would have rated 1 star but they offered me water. I'm glad my nail tech is private and I don't have to come to nail establishments like this.\n"

So I know if you come to Boston Pizza you should have the pizza, but I really wanted pasta. So I ordered plain penne with marinara sauce. In the menu it says juicy fresh cherry tomatoes with fresh grounded basil and oregano with a side of frilled garlic panini bread. Let me tell you this was not the plate that was described in the menu. I swear the sauce was Classico sauce you buy at your grocery store. There was no fresh grounded basil. The bread was a grilled toast not a panini. Overall it sucked. I now remember why I did not like it 4 years ago. I will definitely not make the same mistake again.\n"

      "I went here twice and after leaving with a \"eh\" feeling after both visits decided it was time to switch to another dermatologist.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first visit I specifically requested Dr. Woodson herself after reading a lot of neutral to negative reviews for her PA and NP. After filling out a ton of paperwork (most of which was not very welcoming- I think I signed about three different forms promising I would definitely pay my bill or be sent to a debt collector. I get they want their money, but what a way to greet your new patients!) I went into the exam room and lo and behold PA John Notabartolo walks into the room. Since I was already there I just went with it. He examined my skin (I went in for some mild adult acne) for less than ten seconds, told me basic skin care advice that I've known about for years, and then wrote me some prescriptions. The whole visit with him lasted about three minutes. No real suggestions or overview of my current skin care regime, no explanation of the possible cause of my condition or what level of severity it was. Basically the only thing I couldn't have found on my own online was the prescriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "As another reviewer noted, they tend to prescribe the newest brand name drugs and of course both of mine were brand name and expensive! Thankfully my insurance covered mine with a reasonable co-pay, but definitely double check with your insurance before getting them filled. The prescriptions did help my skin, which was awesome. I went back for a follow up as they'd requested to see me in a few weeks and after waiting for over forty minutes past my appointment time was taken back with very little apology for the wait. Again another three minute visit with the PA with another very hurried skin examination and I left wondering why I'd wasted two hours of my time and another doctor's bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only one lady at the front desk was very friendly; everyone one else in the office seemed less than thrilled to be there. They did call with appointment reminders, which was nice, however the first time they left a voicemail with the time but not the date, and the second time they left a voicemail with one time and then called back and left another voicemail with a different time. Their bills also have the quickest due date I have ever seen. They give you 10 days from when they print the bill until the due date- but they seem to take 1-2 days to mail the bill (so 8 days left), plus 1-2 days in the mail (6 days left), so by the time you get it you have about 4-5 days to get it in the mail to make sure it arrives on time. You better hope you're not on vacation when they send the bill!\n",
      "\n",
      "The last in the chain of events to make me move on to a new doctor was when I called to reschedule my third appointment and was put on hold for 7 minutes and then was greeted by a bored sounding woman who barely apologized for the wait. Instead of rescheduling I just asked her to cancel. I hung up and smiled as I realized I'd successfully broken up with my doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing this office did was horrible, but nothing they did was great either. The little moments of what I consider mediocre medical care and blase customer service just added up for me to the point where I didn't want to deal with it anymore. There's plenty of dermatology offices in this city and given the low reviews dating back for years I feel like this office isn't that interested in improving their business- so I'll just take mine elsewhere.\n"

But it was good, 3\\/5.

When I asked about who has spring break now he rudely replied Paradise Valley schools.  Really????  This was Scottsdale, wtf?\n",

We ended up staying over an hour and having an absolute blast. Nurse Stephanie was fantastic. She is perfect for her job and went above and beyond for us. The food was amazing, although, if you are not used to the grease, be careful (if you know what I mean). The only reason I gave 3 stars is, when I tried to take money out of the ATM, I got an error message. So my Fiancé used his card and we thought everything was fine. Come to find out I was charged for the money I never received. I contacted the grill and am waiting to hear back, hopefully we will resolve this quickly and I can up my review to 5 stars!\n"

He told me well the lady who told you that must be misinformed cause she doesn't know how busy we are. I said well you guys should better train your staff because 5 mins ago you guys told me i can book and 5 mins later you are giving me attitude that absolutely you guys cannot book even before 5:30pm. this is ridiculous and the man who told me was very rude. Don't even have to come into the restaurant to learn your good training and customer service. I know I won't be going into this restaurant and obviously they don't need me as they are too busy\n"

The service was terrible. It was incredibly hard to locate our waitress. We have twin toddlers which do not have an ounce of patience and even though I came fully equipped with snacks and drinks they all ran out before we could get our food. The food not impressive, my husband's burger was dry(for which we had to wait 30 minutes for ketchup). My quesadilla was extremely greasy and our sweet potato fries were cold. It took one of the family members I brought having to ask 3 times for a refill on her Sprite for which she got when she was done eating her sandwich. By the time the desert came I was so discouraged that I didn't even want to try it. I am completely disappointed at this establishment and embarrassed that I brought out of towners here.\n"

      "3. I ordered thai tea, but they were out of half & half, for about another 20-30 minutes. You want to wait? Yeah, sure. Half&half gets delivered....eventually, our server remembers and asks if I still want thai tea. Yes, please. Never got it. But I ended up somewhere else after to fix my craving, and I'm super glad I went somewhere else to splurge my money. \n",
      "4. Substituted two orders of pho that had eye round steak for beef meatballs in one and tripe in the other. Got charged extra because they said beef meatballs and beef tripe are each worth more than eye round steak. \n",
      "First of all, if a bowl of pho w\\/ steak is $6.99, and a bowl of pho w\\/ meatballs is $6.99, how is one worth more than the other? Second, TRIPE IS WORTH MORE THAN STEAK?! I know no one besides my father that would want tripe over steak. Third, our server said he would ask if I can substitute and let me know, but he never let me know. Fourth, I eat A LOT of pho everywhere, no joke, and I have never ever had to pay extra. But then again, all the places I go to actually have a menu item that has brisket and meatball. And guess what, it's the same price as all the other pho bowls w\\/ two meats. \n",
      "Anyways, super irritated that the owner argued with me that meatballs and tripe are each worth more than steak, hence they have to charge to make up the difference. Please. \n",
      "5. I guess last time I went the bowls were $6, now it's $7. \n",
      "6. The spring rolls -- meh. It had so much lettuce in there, and the peanut sauce was very watery. I've had much better spring rolls. \n",
      "7. It's still a nice and clean restaurant. \n",

We had been talking about this for a while and we thought since we had extra liquid courage that we could finally just go and pick one!.\n",

      "Well, spas are not cheap. Cheapest tub in the place at that time was $3,500. We had our eye on one that didn't have water in it, so all we could do is just imagine what the jets felt like. The sales guy Forest, explained to us that we would love it and yada yada. All we said we wanted is strong jets to massage our sore muscles after the gym or other physical activities that we do. We ended up buying one for $200 bucks more that the cheapest one - paid in full - had a 30 day fix warranty. They do not do refunds or returns just fyi.\n",

Side note** they also looked like two gang bangers right out of a C.O.P.S. episode. I'm sure to the older generation they would seem pretty scary. Spas of AZ may want to look in to uniforms.\n",

There's no food options and if the food trucks aren't there you are on your own. You can bring your own food or order pizza like we saw one table do! Smart! Lots of dogs since it's dog friendly.\n"

      "DO NOT come here! I thought I did enough research and chose the right place, but I ended up extremely pissed and disappointed. First off, when I called for an appointment I confirmed with Gina the receptionist that they were in network and requested a price estimate after insurance. Second, I go to my appointment, explain my severe allergies, swollen face, runny nose and all and the doctor chuckles and says \"I'm trying to figure out why you are here to see me.\" Literally those were his words. I blew it off. He advised that they would do one set of tests on day one and I had to come back to do a second set of tests on day two. This is because they only test on the arms and there wasn't enough arm space. When I asked the doctor why he doesn't test anywhere else on the body he told me it was simply so his patients could see the results, no medical reason. (I later figured out this is so they can charge you twice.) I did my testing and also wanted to do food allergy, gluten and dairy testing and the doctor refused with no reasoning. I asked a second time and he said maybe next time. I was insistent because this was something I really wanted and he said he doesn't recommend it and said adults usually have false negatives. At this point I wasn't asking I was telling him this is what I wanted. He leaves for 20 minutes and comes back with a paper, doesn't explain a single thing and tells me to have a nice day. Apparently, it turned out to be a referral to another allergy blood testing center. I had no idea. Gina advised that insurance came back and my co pay was $35. I also asked the if anything would be charged for the second visit and I was told NO. Sure enough nothing was charged for the second visit, not even a copay. Then it gets better, I get a bill in the mail for $600!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They charge $140 for a new patient fee, $760 for the two days of allergy testing, an extra $35 copay that they didn't charge for the second visit and some other stupid fees. I also saw another Yelp review with the same problem. I would have probably been okay paying for it if I hadn't been lied to!\n"

      "If I could give this place no stars I would.  This has to be one of the worst nail experiences I have ever had.  You would think what they lack in talent they make up for in customer service but that is not the case.  I went there to have my nails done since they are on my way home.  I told them many times I wanted the bio gel UV nails and after doing a clear coat of that she proceeded to put shellac on my nails, I asked her again and she said that it will last longer since there is gel underneath, so I went with it.  I got a black and red french manicure with gems on one finger and the grant total was $60.  I mentioned to the lady that the last time I did gel nails which I had on at the time (done somewhere else) they lasted me 5 weeks and she said these will last even longer.  Anyway 2 days later one nail chipped and then another and then by Monday the gems had fallen off.  I called them to complain and that I wanted a refund they said they don't do that and that the manager would call me back.  They did not and I had to call back and they asked me to come back in to have it redone so I reluctantly agreed.  I went back in on Tuesday to have them redone and the service I received was beyond AWFUL.  The lady who greeted me said that it was somehow my fault my nails had chipped and that she would only do a color and not the french or gems even though that is what I paid for.  I asked to speak to a manager and apparently there is never anyone there who is equipped to handle any customer issues.  Anyway she did an absolutely AWFUL job with my nails and practically painted my fingers in the process, I would have been able to do a better job on my own at home.  The whole time she  was RUDE and extremely unaccommodating.  I will NEVER go back to this place and I strongly suggest anyone considering to go here will go elsewhere.  I learnt my lesson and will stick to my regular nail salon in the future.  My advice to the owner give your employees a lesson in customer service and nail tech.  Also maybe be more available to talk to a disgruntled customer.\n"

      "I hired Desert Designers to convert the concrete slab that was my backyard into an inviting space to entertain and relax. After removing many square feet of concrete, Rob Plowright and his team converted my backyard into a desert oasis.  \n",
      "I met Rob Plowright with Desert Designer at the home show in February 2016.  Rob was one of five landscape designers who I interviewed.  I ultimately decided to go with Desert Designer because Rob understood how I wanted to use my yard and the problems that I had with the space in its original state.  Rob came up with a great plan that was functional and esthetically pleasing.  In fact, he took an off-hand comment that I had made about eventually wanting a container garden on the side yard, and came up with a unique container garden that will withstand prolonged sun exposure without deteriorating.  Rob is also extremely organized and detail-oriented.  He was the only one of the five designers who I interviewed who scheduled a follow-up appointment at the time of our first meeting.  Within a week of our first meeting, I had received multiple emails with alternative price lists and pictures of the proposed plants.  At our second meeting, Rob presented his plans with line-item pricelists, walked me through two proposals, and explained to me why he made the choices that he did.  Although other designers may have had fancier presentations with 3D computer models, Rob's plan was spot-on to my vision and under budget!  In fact, because the estimate was so reasonable, I ultimately expanded the project to include additional landscaping in the backyard and replacement of the irrigation system in the front yard.  Rob was also patient and responsive to the numerous questions that I emailed him sent before, during, and after the project was complete.\n",
      "On the day my project was scheduled to begin, the Desert Designer team was on time (maybe even earlier), and worked quickly without sacrificing attention to detail.  Not only did the team work efficiently, finishing the project in just four days, but it was done perfectly, and my yard and the street were immaculate.  Even my neighbors commented on how great a job Desert Designers had done on cleaning up.  And because the workers are employees, and not merely contracted for the day or project, I didn't worry while I was at work about whether they would show up or complete the day.  The following day, I met Rob at my house where he gave me an orientation on plant care, the new irrigation system, and the warranty on the pavers and labor. Like any home improvement project, there were a few hiccups along the way, but I had complete confidence that Desert Designer would make sure the job was completed to the highest standards.  \n",
      "I am beyond pleased with the way my backyard turned out.  If you are looking to transform your yard, I highly recommend that you contact Desert Designer.\n"

She also talked to me like she would rather play in traffic than be behind that counter. Here's the real problem: my order came out ten minutes later. No one even bothered to look at the bag. I never gave it a second thought because I was told it would be at least 25 minutes. I figured it was a call-in order and that's why no one did anything. So, 30 minutes after placing my order I finally walked up to ask about my food. I was handed the bag, which was the only bag there on the counter. I said, \"oh, it's the bag that's been sitting there for 20 minutes and no one called my name.\" The girl just kind of rolled her eyes and gave me attitude. Sigh.\n",

      "Tucked away in the commercial center outlets is this unsuspecting Gem. Nothing snooty on the outside. On the inside palate heaven awaits. Took 3 of my co-workers there today, impressed with the menu selection and variety of pasty flavor combinations including multiple vegetarian selections. But I'm a meat kind of man. I had the Carne Adovada pasty, filled with delicious Mexican spiced pork paired with salsa and sour cream and a Wookey Jack dark rye IPA. Crust was baked to perfection, flaky and delicious. Beer was prompt and wonderful. Friends had Bangers and Mash (with house made sausage) and the Pesto Chicken (house made pesto), we inhaled everything. Great fast service and turnaround and you can watch the creation of multiple pastys near the bar area by the friendly rag-tag crew. Good selection of draft microbrews and canned beer to satisfy your thirst. Looking forward to their new digs and cocktail menu when they make the move downtown in the future. Regardless this remains a great place with takeout or dine-in for a great meal.\n"
