This place is WAAAY over priced for the generic cuisine they serve. Aside from that, the food is only room temperature. You are much better off spending your dollars at Buffet @ Asia. At least there they have a decent assortment of sushi and a standard Mongolian BBQ.	1	Lee's Buffet	2
Our taxi driver had told us to go to this place.. thank god we did!! our group loved the food and we could not leave Vegas without going back one last time. Food was fresh and so so so so soooo good!! :)	5	Village Pub and Cafe	3.5
Not worth the $20! I'm a Las Vegas buffet connoisseur and had high hopes, since Golden Nugget is the crown jewel of downtown. I can honestly say I could not have been more disappointed. The quality of the food was OK, but the selection was abysmal! By far, the least amount of options of any buffet I've been to, which is 20 +.	2	Golden Nugget Buffet	2.5
Great All-American cuisine with hearty helpings at fair prices. Reminds me of a lodge at Big Bear, Lake Arrowhead or Mt. Charleston. Definitely worth a try.	5	Black Bear Diner	4
The bacon burger is a MUST! One of the most delicious burgers I've ever eaten. The bartenders were very friendly and talkative. The ambience was very nice as well. Definitely worth a visit.	5	Bacon Bar	3.5
Get a free margarita when you check-in on Yelp! Generous portions of delicious Mexican dishes :)	5	Bonito Michoacan	4
"Special date night and we just like to have fun, interact with the staff and enjoy good wine. Unfortunately our waiter was not in the same frame of mind, in fact he ruined the evening for me. (Diners on Aug 20, 15)
Then the food? Not at all up to par. We only picked at our food and left more than half behind. Will not be returning."	1	McCormick & Schmick's Seafood & Steaks	3.5
"This place is. So. Good. Go there. 

My husband and I went downtown for date night and stopped in here to get dinner. I had the arepa with avacado on it and the plantains and he had the pork arepa. All of it was perfect. I usually don't eat bread, but made an exception after reading reviews of this place and I'm glad that I did. The cornbread rolls they make the sandwiches with are so delicious. The ingredients tasted so fresh and the service was super friendly; now my husband mentions this place every date night."	4	Viva Las Arepas	4.5
"When I first walked into the restaurant I was greeted with amazing welcoming staff :) 
The food was amazing ! The recommendations by our waiter was on point . 
I couldn't be any happier than my first experience at this amazing restaurant . 

Thank you Nico !:)"	5	Prosecco Fresh Italian Kitchen	4.5
Not the first fat burger that I have had and will not be the last. Good burger better fries. One thing I will say there was only two girls working and they were a little busey and those two did a good job getting food out.	3	Fatburger	2.5
Not great not bad if you are in a hurry and need a bite then stop in if you are looking for a great pizza then keep looking.	3	Pizzeria Francesco's	3
Good food great for groups good service only down side it is a bit pricey	4	Buca di Beppo	3
Real good pizza nothing bad to say about except that I don't have one near home. Great crust love the wood oven fired cooking nice guy behind the counter. Good value for the money. I will be back.	5	Due Pizzeria	4.5
Better than average burger good fries but at what point is 20 dollars much money for a burger, fries and a coke.	3	Burger Bar	4
Stayed here for three nights if you are looking for a cheap place to stay and plan on enjoying all that Las Vegas has to offer other than this place and just need a place to sleep and shower then this is your place. It is not bad but I wouldn't let my mother stay here. You know the old saying you get what you pay for and at 40 dollars a night that is true here.	2	Hooters Casino Hotel Las Vegas	2.5
"best bbq in vegas.  they used to have real brewed iced tee.  they replaced it with this fountain thing and i asked the owner whats up with the fake iced tee fountain.  he looked me in the eye and told me a balled faced lie that it was an automatic tee brewing machine.  LIER!!!!!!!!!!!!!  next time i came in i saw his son changing out the
plastic bag of bs gmo garbage fake asss iced tee.  i'll never eat there again.  

scum bags

too bad cause i really love there food.  its legit real bad asss down home food.
the owner is lying scum."	1	Rollin Smoke Barbeque	4.5
We got robbed by pink taco last night.  105 dollars for chappy garbage food and tiny margaritas for 2 people.  I've had 10 times better food on a street corner in North Las Vegas for 5 bux.  I'm super pissd.  I've never done it before but I even stiffed the chappy as waitres.  And I don't feel bad for her one second.  I dare you to go into this rip off joint.	1	Pink Taco	3.5
"The most UNBELIEVABLE rude pretentious dushbagial jack shack i have ever been to.  Three times three bad experiences with lame ass pretentious employees and owner.  There are always plenty of tables available but we are always told we have to wait. Each time it was for a party of 2 and when we were finally seated after waiting a good half hour plus each time it was always in a poor sitting area, exp-- lopsided rocking table right next to the kitchen\/employee entrances. The food is descent, nothing to scream about but with such a poor experience with the seating every time it is a definite turn off for deciding on places to eat downtown. There are plenty of amazing eats downtown to not have to deal with this each and every time we want to retry this spot. Too bad we don't make this restaurants 'exclusive' special people list.
Oh and I'm sure all of these AMAZING review are the eye rolling pretentious looser ass owner lady trying to ""bury"" the real reviews.  yes and i meant to leave zero stars but it doesn't seam to go that low.

OH YA AND WE WALKED A BLOCK OR TWO AND ""ATE"" AT RACHEL'S KITCHEN.
IT WAS AWESOME  AND THE PEOPLE THERE WERE PLENTY NICE TO US."	1	Eat.	4
"kept going into this place cause its close my my office by im done.  I just realized this hipster flaming dushbag establishment is selling MONSANTO GARBAGE GMO PRODUCTS dispensed out of a fountain drink dispenser.  yes lipton ice tee.  really go see for yourself.  
and for 3.25 for a small to go cup.  SCUM"	1	Makers & Finders Coffee	4.5
Doesn't even deserve a star! Made a reservation for Super Bowl Sunday for a party of 8 (which means big $$$ to an owner or SMART manager). Our reservation was not honored because they never checked their open table account & confirm the day before for the $250 deposit. So glad I showed up 15 minutes before game time with no reservations. Been searching the rest of the casino for a table for 8. Now we have no where to watch other than our room. So glad we made the trip all the way out to Vegas from San Diego to watch the big game in our hotel room!!	1	PBR Rock Bar & Grill	3
Really good food and the service was great very helpful when it came to choosing my food .The orchata was the best one in town and my favorite was the octopus tacos they were really good .will defiantly recommend .	5	Bajamar Seafood & Tacos	5
Nothing fast about this place.... 20 mins in drive thru. Food order was wrong and not worth going back. Can drive to the boarder of Mexico faster then these guys serve food.	1	Taco Bell	3
Took a while to get our food. There was like no one there and I soon understood why. Once we finally got our food I was very disappointed. Tasted like the cafeteria food I got in middle school. The chicken was soggy. The fries were under cooked. Just all around not very good. Not worth the price at all. I would go McDonald's over this place.	2	Checker's	2
High quality chicken! I've been to this location many many times and every time j come the chicken is fresh and the toast and fries are too. And man do I love that sauce! I always get extra sauce so I can dip everything in it. The customer service is on point, they are always friendly and always bring the food to you. I highly recommend this place.	5	Raising Cane's	4
Horrible customer service. My friend and I were close to the area after being at the gym so we just wanted to stop in and get something fast. We both like chicken and hadn't tried Popeyes yet so we stopped in to try it. It was about 11 pm there was only one customer in they're besides us and after waiting for ten minutes they never got to us and got down our order. They were just kinda slothing around in the kitchen area making the other persons order and never took the time to get to us so we ended up just leaving not even having a chance to try the food.	1	Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen	2
I work very close to this location and have been here many times and have tried almost everything they have on menu. For the price you pay you get really good quality food. I usually get the chimichanga, the fried tortilla is always fresh and the meat is zesty and delicious. The portions are really good and the ingredients are fresh. The food also comes out really quick so much better then like a Taco Bell or dell taco.	5	Habaneros Taco Grill	4
"Every time I come to Vegas, I MUST eat here. This is probably the best food I've ever eaten and the hot sauce is AMAZING. Better than sriracha and not too spicy.  You will leave satisfied.

Try the combo plates and make sure you get the baklava. The staff are the friendliest I've ever met and always excited to help make your first visit one to remember."	5	Amena Bakery & Deli	4.5
Great, affordable food in a classy setting at the Wynn.  My turkey burger made with sun dried tomatoes and served on fontina focaccia was delicious.  Other items looked great.  I also loved the cozy couch at our table.  Wine was on the pricey side, but overall this was a great Vegas value.	4	Terrace Pointe Cafe	4
"When they said casual, they weren't kidding.  If I was interested in an Olive Garden like experience with slightly better food, then I wouldn't have been disappointed.  Unfortunately the only way to get me into Olive Garden is to drop me in some town where the ONLY other option is Applebee's.  This being Vegas, I had higher expectations.

The food was fair, but standard, uncreative Italian.  The bread and bread sticks came wrapped up in paper (classy, eh?).  We had to ask to get some olive oil, otherwise it was served with nothing.  We were seated in the Venetian's fake Italian ""plaza"" which although novel for a few minutes, eventually feels like just another mall and didn't make for a cozy (or lively) dining experience. The service was fair but completely forgettable, like just about everything about this experience.  Set your sights low, or try something else."	2	Enoteca San Marco	3.5
Efter 3 veckor på vägarna i Kalifornien,Arizona och Nevada med restauranger av medioker klass kom vi äntligen till Las Vegas och hittade Spago. Här blev vi glatt överraskade med fin service,utsökt mat och bra viner,allt detta till acceptabelt pris. Restaurangen hade en varm och behaglig atmosfär och miljön gjorde så att man fick en känsla av att man satt utomhus. Det var så bra att vi gick dit två kvällar i rad. Kan verkligen rekommendera detta ställe och pröva gärna deras Linguine med skaldjur!	5	Spago by Wolfgang Puck	4
"Food A
Service D

Sloooooooooooow.  Waitress took her sweet time getting our menus, food, and check which has 20% added as gratuity - which explains why service is poor, there is no incentive to do well."	3	17 South Booze & Bites	3
"Looked cool on tv. 
Tasted like nothing to brag about. 

Yes the medical theme is cool, the girls are basically hooters girls in nurse outfits. You wear a hospital gown and there's cool decor and eye candy. People get spanked 

Your wallet is also getting spanked. $13 for a single burger, fries, and coke? And I missed what was so awesome about it. They don't put pickles or lettuce on the burgers, they're pretty plain. I thought the bun would be sinfully delicious, nope!! Nothing special there. 
And the fries were nothing special, I really don't get what the appeal of the actual food is. Five Guys is way better, even Wendy's is better. 
Our server was not that great. Waited 20 minutes to get our check and the place wasn't even crowded on a Saturday at 230pm. 
Skip it and grab a 99 cent fried Twinkie down the street."	2	Heart Attack Grill	3
"I ate here at 2pm and its now midnight and I'm still not hungry. 

For $32 you get all the snow crab legs you can eat w out getting sick, endless California rolls, amazing blueberry blintzes, diverse desserts, and much more. 

The only thing I wish this place had was chicken wings or fried chicken."	4	The Buffet at ARIA	3
One of the best vegan food I have had till now. The place is beautifully done up, the service is great and the staff is really kind. They were very sweet enough to plate our order in 2 different plates as we were sharing the meal. The veggie burger and gracias Madre quesadilla was delicious. Don't miss the dessert, the Blueberry Cheesecake is a must have.	5	VegeNation	4.5
Bartenders were friendly however they have a food truck called Bud Bud's Eats inside. Food wasn't good and the food struck staff were very rude.	1	The Still	3.5
They have stupid rules about combining tables, instead they let us wait and let everyone who came after us sit!	2	Sushi Mon	4
"Since trying out halal at Halal Guys in NYC, my friends and I have been looking for a place that has good Mediterranean food w\/ the same white sauce. Baladie is not only the closest to having that same white sauce (common tzatziki sauce isn't the same thing), but their food was amazing. We had the #2, which is a gyro platter w\/ a beef\/lamb mix for the meat. We chose rice (good choice in the end) instead of the vegetables. Best Mediterranean food we've had in town. Also, their baklava is going to have me dreaming about it for the next few weeks. 

The guy (I'm assuming the owner, along w\/ his wife?) was super friendly and had a good sense of humor, to go along w\/ great customer service. Definitely a 5 star place that I'll be hitting up again in the future."	5	Baladie Café	4
Hands down best Alfredo I've ever had in my life, no joke! Ambience was great too, tables are kind if close but has very homey feel and live band was good, tool any request. Is my go-to spot for romantic dinner next time I'm in Vegas!	5	Casa Di Amore	4.5
I had a dog, it was tasty. It's a pretty good choice for being in Vegas. Lots of seating, quick service!	3	Nathan's Famous	3

"Went to Tao for the 2nd time this past Labor Day weekend and enjoyed myself. Was here before a few years ago and had a great time but with the club scene, that can change over time. Entry was smooth since we were on the guest list and it was a group of all girls, so it did not take longer than 5 minutes and Busta Rhymes was suppose to be there (don't think he showed up though). 

As others have mentioned, dance floor is too small and we avoided it. Made our own dance floor by the VIP section where my friends and I enjoyed the bottle service of various groups around us for free (helps to be pretty and a girl). Music was really good - didn't try out the other rooms until later in the night but they seemed to be popular. I like the mix of the club - people from all ethnicities and those looking for a good time."	4	Tao Nightclub	3
"Visited here three times over the Labor Day holiday weekend. First time was for a late lunch and it was amazing! Our group of 5 raved about all of the food (french toast, curry mussels, mashed potatoes, tacos) especially the dessert (macaroons, gelato, mouse). That was on a Friday and it was $20 pp with a complimentary mimosa. 

Since we liked it so much, we went back on Sunday for dinner. Unfortunately, lightning did not strike twice. The food was lukewarm, price was higher which was expected for dinner but nothing worthy of the additional price hike (holiday pricing at $40 pp) and even the salted caramel peanut gelato did not move us like the previous visit. Luckily for us, we had a huge credit from the Cosmo since they have poor customer service in the hotel, that our meal was free.

So, our last day in Vegas, we wanted to spend our food credit and were hoping that they were just having an off night on Sunday. We encountered holiday pricing yet again ($31 pp) but no free mimosas this time, which means we paid more but got less. The food was pretty good, not as great as the first time but good enough that I would visit again when in Vegas. 

One consistent problem, the lines get really long (I believe they hold the lines similarly to a nightclub because there are plenty of tables) and if you are not platinum members (fortunately, we were), it can be a really long wait. It is a little ridiculous for a buffet to act so pretentious."	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"Came here for dinner b\/c we arrived at the hotel late and we were too lazy to go anywhere else. We had originally picked Oyster Bar but the line was crazy long for only 10 seats and we didn't feel like standing in line for 1+ hours. 

Prime rib dinner - For $11.99, this was a darn good deal. Giant piece of beef, with your choice of baked or mashed potatoes, and some veggies on the side. The beef was tender and edible and hey, that's the most you can ask for at that price.

Reuben sandwich - Holy moly this sandwich was greasy!  It literally dripped grease the entire time. Grease aside, I wish they sliced the pastrami thinner as there were definitely pieces that needed to be cut with a knife and not with bare teeth. Still, it was tasty.

Overall, the Grand Cafe is a nice clean place if you happen to find yourself as the Palace Station hotel and you're looking for a quick place for dinner."	3	Grand Café	2.5
"Came here for dinner b\/c we arrived at the hotel late and we were too lazy to go anywhere else. 

Mushroom Swiss burger - This was actually pretty decent but a tad on the small side. 

Fish Sandwich - Ugh. This was virtually inedible. The fish was fried waay past crispy, bordering on rock hard. Disgusting. 

Overall, don't come here unless you really have no other place to eat."	2	The Garden Grill	3
We were there for new year's eve dinner. Outdoor seating for 15 people, they were really nice to take our reservation the morning of. It's a $110\/ person set menu not including drinks. Yea...a little on the pricey side, but the location and view is great! The food is not bad either, the waitress was awesome! She made our night!!!! Would def. go back again anytime!	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
As much as i love to dine here not tht sanitary although typically ive always gone to bj's in san diego. This particular bj's really needs to get it together. There booth chairs had crumbs all over it. The menu had dried up old food. Lastly the bathroom, the first 3 stalls had no tissue. Smh. Come on i could hve gobe to jack in the box for this or any fast food for tht matter!!!	2	BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse	3
OH...MY...GOD. THEEEE most amazing Chorizo hash that I've ever had. Then my mother ordered chicken and waffles so FUCK THE WORLD! It was crazy. God I love Donna. She is killer. Anyway, peace out. Chicago loves you Vegas!!!!	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
This place is great. The options are incredible and they even have Gluten Free options! The wait can be a bit long so definitely choose your timing wisely or plan to add your name and shop at one of the nearby stores.	5	The Cracked Egg	4
"Home-Made Authentic Japanese Cuisine served with a genuine smile and friendly conversation.  Not fusion.  Better. Way Better.

Only down-side is the area is a tad on the 'sketch' side for a visiting tourist.  But other than that,   'sake bomb' away!!"	4	Fuji Japanese Restaurant	4
I went here for the open mic last night (Friday).  Everyone was super nice and friendly.  Down to earth very talented musicians vibe!!!	5	Brentwood Cafe & Tavern	3.5

"I was extremely excited to be able to support a small business in my area and have given the business several opportunities to make up for their issues which I initially thought was because it was new but it's going on 3 months since opening and things have only gone downhill in terms of quality and consistency. Don't let the name fool you, this is no italian market. I would be surprised if they even have a slicer on the premises as you cannot buy cured meats or any italian cheeses on site aside from prepackaged items and dry pasta that I'm pretty sure has been there since its grand opening.

Decor is nice. Outdoor seating features fire pits and the interior is a mix of rustic wood and brick. Their brick oven looks impressive--custom designed down to the name of the business--Tony Bolony--but wait, isn't their business called Plantones? A quick google shows Tony Baloneys is a trademarked named business in San Francisco. Perhaps an oversight on their part and a very pricey one.

It's unfortunately another one of those restaurants that makes the mistake of opting to provide both fast food service (go to the counter to order, fill your own drinks etc) with server service. If they wanted to provide a full service dining experience they should just offer it when you walk in. And since you aren't assigned any server in particular food runners get confused since they didn't take your order and don't know where to go or who to look for or who to give the food. More often than not I will get my food before the customers who arrived before me for whatever reason. I guess I'm just lucky? Cashiers are hit and miss--some are just there obviously for the paycheck. No smile no greeting. Just jaded looking teenagers waiting to clock out. Servers have always provided service with a smile--more recently they have been exceptional, the only reason they should get any stars at all.

The actual pizzas are virtually flavorless. The bottoms of pizzas show their lack of cleaning of their oven. Covered in black soot. Perhaps they thought this would add to the flavor of the pizza? It's hard to tell that they were baked in a brick oven pizza as it lacks any flavor hinting towards that. The pepperoni itself is sparse and extremely mild. The grilled chicken also has no seasoning whatsoever and the texture of their mushrooms is miserable--like they boiled or microwaved them and just threw them into storage. Another pizza place which shall remain unnamed has $8 12"" pizzas with unlimited toppings with over 30 to choose from... Plantones (10"" for $10) just can't compare with less than 20 toppings.

Sandwiches are extremely small for the price and NOTHING like the owner posted photos! The meat is sparse and also lack flavor. The chicken parm is a soggy mess and maybe 4 inches long! The italian sausage barely has any seasoning and lacks any spice whatsoever... The meat in the baloney sandwich was completely blackened--no joke! I guess this is what happens when a realtor tries to be a restaurateur. If he wants his business to succeed the restaurant would be better off without him there as he completely lacks customer service skills and seems to have a poor attitude when he is there."	1	Plantone's Italian Market	4
Excellent service, and it didn't hurt that as diamond members we received complimentary amuse-bouche and mignardise. The popovers were pretty good--hot bread is always welcome. We ordered the intimidating 36 oz porterhouse and lamb chops both medium rare. Unfortunately the porterhouse arrived blue rare while the lamb chops arrived rare. The sides were a joke. At $12 at other steakhouses, a side is usually pretty generous, but the stuffed mushrooms were tiny and only came with 5 and were honestly kind of gross. The truffle mashed potatoes had oil leaking from them, was overseasoned in a tiny cast iron pot, maybe half a cup of mash. If the sides were more generous and the meats cooked properly we would definitely have returned as the quality was there. Maybe it was an off night?	3	BLT Steak	4
Wow. Service is terrible. We waited over 30 minutes for two taiyaki cones and by the time it came it turned out they were out of the fillings I wanted so they substituted random items instead and ASSumed I would be fine with them. The custard filling was maybe a teaspoon because they were apparently out of that and just stuffed an extra marshmallow to fill it up. The ice cream was loaded with ice crystals from being refrozen so many times. The taiyaki (fish waffle) itself was super DRY, CHEWY and BLAND. The ice cream scoop itself was a joke. Definitely not worth $8 at all.	1	Cafe Summer	4
Wow. 8 bucks for a tiny portion of chicken and a ton of rice. on top of that it was extremely salty, had CANNED mushrooms and no veggies. At most they put maybe 4 oz of meat. For 8 bucks.	1	Thai Style Noodle House	3.5
Horrible! the "ceviche" was raw grey flavorless shrimp and the spicy tuna had a questionable texture like it had been cooked part way. It wasn't seasoned properly so it wasn't spicy or salty AT ALL.  Brown rice was too hard--and I eat brown rice all the time. It should be firm and nutty. Not difficult to chew. Very dissappointing overall. Took two bites and the rest went in the garbage.	1	Soulfish Poké	2.5
Inconsistent portions, poorly seasoned food and BOTTOM OF THE BARREL service. No greeting when you walk in, no smiles. Employees don't even look at you when you go in.  Beef is overcooked and dry, vegetables are steamed with no salt so no flavor there whatsoever. Soba is just boiled noodles as well. No flavor. And take a look at a pic of the egg roll I got. Burnt till it was black! Seriously?	1	Samurai Sam's	3
It was just okay. I guess being an L.A. native and making trips to K-Town for some awesome Korean BBQ really set the bar. This place has limited items, compared to other Korean BBQ joints back in L.A. The price also appeared to be unreasonable for the amount and quality we were getting as well. For about $60.00 you can get a lot more variety elsewhere. I guess if you are craving Korean BBQ in Las Vegas, then this place would be your first choice, since it's also on the strip.	3	Ginseng Korean BBQ II	3
Ok - for airport food I'd give this place a solid 3 star. Overall good food. Definitely some of the best place I've eaten at in the Vegas airport. I had Pat's Pounder Platter and the meats were all tasty and the BBQ dusted green beans were surprisingly crispy. I had the BBQ sauce on the side and am glad I did as i found it very sweet. Granted I prefer heat over sweet.	3	Brookwood Farms BBQ	3
Love this place! Great ambience, friendly staff. The food is authentic and the portion is generous! I highly recommend everybody to come experience and you'll agree with me!!!!! :)	5	ChiAm Restaurant	3.5
Bite is clean! It was wonderful, tasty, wholesome food. The Guinness pancakes have bacon pieces IN them- Brilliant! The Special Omelet was creamy, yet fluffy. The service was promo and attentive even thought the place was packed. We rolled back out to the car full, and happy. Vegas!- help this place stay alive! Eat at Bite.	5	Bite Breakfast & Lunch	4.5

"This place is located conveniently in Planet Hollywood.  Everytime I attempted to go there was a line out the door.  Finally decided to bite the bullet and wait in line.  The wait was not as long as anticipated and once seated the restaurants design is awesome and entertaining.  

I had the earth burger and my bf had the farm burger.  Both were very good.  The menu is pretty small.  I was looking forward to maybe a fish burger but there was nothing to be found.  In any case the food was fantastic and I will be back."	4	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
"For the lunch menu...

Amazing! Delicious and authentic paella, gazpacho, and sangria. The service was very friendly and food was fast. 

Everything was very flavorful and we will definitely be coming back!"	5	Jaleo	3.5
One of the best dining experiences I've had. My group had a 6pm reservation and we were seated promptly. I ordered the kabuto omakase, and it was so filling and worth the $120. The waitress explained the origin of each fish. It was amazing! Will definitely come back next time I am in Las Vegas.	5	Kabuto	4.5
For the first time I went today to get some popusas they where delicious I order frijoles con queso with is beans with mozzarella cheese n their only .99¢ when u by more than 12. I would recommend you to go.	5	San Salvador Restaurant	3.5
Very bad service I would never come back they charge me $28.00 n gave me the wrong food they didn't have the curtesy of giving me the right order they just told me the they had a lot of order which it was not true they were just talking in the back n not taking the right order I was so pissed that I just left and they didn't even say that they were sorry or if I wanted my money back I would never go again very very bad customer service.	1	Rivas Mexican Grill #2	3.5
The food was terrible I order shimp with bacon n cheese n they were hard n didn't have a good taste n to let you know they don't clean the shimp at all you could get sick from this is  so disgusting. I would never go back and the service is terrible.	1	El Diamante Restaurant	3
I came for breakfast on Monday morning at around 10:30 and it was $20 per person. I would recommend coming around this time if you can because you pay the breakfast price and get to eat both breakfast and lunch! Sodas and juices are included in the price of the buffet as well. My favorite things that I tried were the roasted cauliflower, corn, and mango sorbet. Everything tasted pretty average and nothing really stood out to me taste wise. I personally liked the Wicked Spoon Buffet in the Cosmopolitan better but this buffet is definitely worth a try!	4	The Buffet	3.5
"We came here for dinner after watching KA. I was thinking about ordering the smaller 3 course meal but I decided to order the 4 course prix fixe meal because I wanted dessert. L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is a more affordable version of the Joel Robuchon restaurant next door. My 4 course meal here was around $70. 

The bread basket was good. My favorite was this small round bread that tasted like a puff pastry croissant. The amuse bouche had mixed reviews at our table. Some thought it was inedible and it scared me to eat it but I didn't think it was too bad. It is warm pate with a texture like flan and some foam. 

The waiter was really nice and offered some helpful food recommendations. I ordered the Calamari, Broccoli and Bacon Soup, Duck, and Tarts. My sister ordered the Beef Cheek as her main course which was small but really tender. The Calamari and Broccoli and Bacon soup appetizers were interesting and yummy. I really liked the Duck as well. I was pretty stuffed by the third round so I wasn't able to finish my dessert! The dessert came with 5 tarts - chocolate, fruit, cinnamon, lemon, and snickers. All of them were delicious!"	4	L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon	4.5
This was my favorite buffet in Vegas and possibly ever! I came on a Saturday and the line was pretty long but it went by quickly. I paid around $70 for lunch not including tip for my sister and I. My favorite parts of the buffet were the Korean BBQ Beef Short Ribs, Pork Belly, Fried Chicken, Pizza, Garlic Bread, Gelato, and Desserts. Sodas and Juices are included in the price of the buffet as well. The food came in small individual sized portions so I was full and happy at the end of my meal and not too stuffed.	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"We came on a Sunday night before O and the view was beautiful! If you sit on the patio, you'll get a front row seat to the Fountains at Bellagio. We watched the sunset while the Fountains went off every half hour until 8 and then every 15 minutes after 8. I wasn't hungry and a little nauseous and there were only two options on the menu. The smaller of the two options had two appetizers, an entree and a dessert for $115. I wasn't feeling well or hungry enough to eat that much so I asked our waiter if I could just have a salad. Our meal came with an amuse bouche with potato soup and something fried, bread, and butter with Picasso printed on it. All the appetizers were yummy. The salad was expensive at $22 but it was good. 

My sister had the four course meal and I tried a little bite of everything and it was delicious! The courses were small. The fish appetizer with cauliflower mashed potatoes was buttery, flaky, and delicious. The pigeon was my favorite entree. I've had pigeon in Chinatown but this one was so much more flavorful and tender! The veal chop was fatty and delicious as well but I liked the pigeon better. The desserts tasted like your typical desserts. I didn't order a dessert but I had some birthday petite fours which were pretty tasty. The best part of this restaurant is the view and the Picasso art inside. The food is delicious but the price can be a little off-putting considering that the cheapest option on the menu for dinner was $115."	4	Picasso	4.5
I ordered the Nutella milkshake, Kobe beef burger on an onion bun with bacon, cheddar, and truffle mayo, and our table split the fried macaroni and cheese, fried zucchini, and onion rings. I don't know if I ordered wrong but my beef didn't have a lot of flavor. The fried macaroni and cheese was my favorite! The Nutella milkshake was pretty yummy as well. For the price and since there are so many other delicious dining options in Vegas, I would not recommend The Burger Bar. Our waiter however was very attentive and split our bill for us to include the shared fried foods we ordered which was pretty awesome!	3	Burger Bar	4
"Just ate lunch and signed up for Yelp to ""check in and get a free taco.""  As I had ordered the 3 taco combo I was told that they would just discount the drink for me that I was ordering as it would make my total cheaper! Thanks for looking out. 

Had 3 asada tacos that were very juicy and had great flavor; I had them in the corn tortilla shells and added crema, cilantro and salsa roja, the shells were a little burnt in appearance but not in taste however they did fall apart. For my sides I had rice that tasted great and chips which tasted like they were homemade. All in all a good meal and I will be coming back, probably going to go with flour tortillas next time though."	4	Saborr	4
I've past Griddlecakes for a long time now, and I'm glad I finally stopped in for breakfast.  The menu seemed a little limited, it's about the same price as Egg Works - and much better.  I had the Meat Lover's Scramble and loved it.  It's worth a try!  I'll be back.	4	Griddlecakes	3.5
It's mac and cheese. Not much else to say except I won't be going again. Very over-priced for just mac n cheese and if you add any meat, holy cow it gets expensive.  The Mac n cheese isn't even that good, certainly not as good as most regular restaurants that offer it as a side dish. I suppose my expectations were too high, but seriously I don't understand the concept.	2	Mac Shack Spring Valley	3.5
"Finally got around to trying this place after having living in Mtn's Edge for 1.5 years. Wish I had tried it sooner. Food was very good, family of servers were very polite and friendly. 

Pros: Food was very good, big portions. Food came out pretty quick, drinks always full. Staff was very friendly, you could tell there were a lot of regulars there because they were really buddy buddy with a few tables. It truly is family owned and family run, which is nice.

Cons: Terrible location, hard to find and not near anything. Inconsiderate jerk smokers right outside the front entrance when the door was open, made the whole place stink, I had to say something before they closed the door but the damage had already been done. Place is kind of small so I imagine there would be a long wait during busy times.

We will definitely be back since food and service were so good."	4	Our Families Country Cafe	4
"I've been to this locations dozens of times. Haven't been back in months because of the slow and horrific service provided every single time. And now I hate myself again.

I showed up with only 2 people ahead of me. Trash can overflowing, dirty tables everywhere and trash in the ground.

I'm not expecting Four Seasons treatment at a fast casual place, but can I get a hello and a smile? My god. They just stare and give nods instead of questions, put the wrong stuff on my order, despite very clear directions.

Then in the middle of order, there was some kind of molasses speed shift change. They had 20+ workers standing around chatting. Now a line of ten people forms behind me and I haven't moved. The new guy grabs my salad and starts loading it up with everything without asking. I had to start over. The workers are bumping each other, touching  everything, and joking around. 

Finally they try to get me to pay for someone else's meal, then try to over charge me. Just the worst.

I'd like to say I'll never be back. But in a few months I'll forget and be a glutton again. 

This place is the worst. Do not come here. Give your money to someone else until they fix their management problem which has been ongoing for years."	1	Cafe Rio	2.5
Food is always good. I always sit in the bar area and beware, it's always freezing. I like it cold but holy crap you shiver when you eat, even in the summer!	4	Chili's	2.5
This place is pretty awesome. A lot like the old Rally's I remember as a kid. Fries aren't quite as insanely good as I remember but the burgers are pretty good. But, be careful leaving the drive-thru! It's super narrow and has a sharp bend and there are tire rub marks all over that damn thing... and I clipped my rim... damn it...	4	Checker's	2
Awesome place with really nice people and great food.  They are always innovating and coming up with new dishes, most of which are fantastic. There have been a few duds but out of dozens and dozens of dishes I've tried, I've been very pleased. Everyone is always friendly and smiling, you can tell that their culture means a lot to them and it's awesome. The fountain drinks are some weird bottling company and taste funny, they should change that to a regular coke\/pepsi machine (preferably Coke with Coke Zero.) Definitely a little pricey for a "fast casual" type place, but the ingredients are always fresh and it's worth it.	5	SkinnyFATS	4.5
Great place.  Always fresh and always great service.  A lot of sushi places you get ignored or slow service, but not here.  If anything, they might check on you TOO much, if that's even possible.  Super friendly, lots of choices and every kind of roll, great AYCE.  Seriously can't go wrong with this place, it's always great.	5	Sumo Sushi 2	3.5
"I've tried eating here 3 times but only got food to go once. 

First time i stood at the entrance waiting for someone to acknowledge me and eventually seat me. I stood there for 5 minutes while people whisked past me without so much as a smile. I left.

Second time I was more patient, I waited the same 5 minutes being ignored, then got sat at a ""dirty table.""  I guess it wasn't filthy but the tabletop certainly wasn't wiped very well (sticky). I waited 10 minutes before any server came to say hi, she wasn't very pleasant. I asked if it was a long wait for food ilke BBQ mix and she said it depends. She was called away and didn't return for another 5 minutes so I left.

Third time I decided I just HAD to at least try their dang food but I won't go inside. I ordered Ahi Poke and Loco Moco to go. Poke was pretty good, gigantic chunks and a lot of it, better be for $20. The Loco Moco was horrid. Plain, bland, no flavor at all, hardly any gravy, it was just plain bad.

I won't be attempting a 4th visit here. I'll just go to O'hana BBQ down the road."	1	Island Flavor	4.5
"Been to all 3 locations and they're pretty consistent. Always pretty busy, food quality always quite high, service always just decent, prices always high.

Pros: Burgers are excellent, usually cooked right. Very very tasty combinations. They have beer which is great for a high quality burger. Locations are convenient in different parts of town.

Cons: Way over-priced, about 25% more than I'd expect to pay. Fries are gross because they are those shoe-string style that are basically 1% potato and 99% batter. Most locations very busy and food comes out very slowly.

Will eat here again sporadically because the burgers are just so damn tasty. Wish they'd change their fries and lower their prices though, then I'd come weekly."	4	Bachi Burger	4
This place just keeps getting better. Food is absolutely delicious and service is always fast and friendly.	5	Volcano Grille	4
"This place is pretty great. Very high quality food and quite diverse. The portions are definitely decent even though I'd say the menu is a tad pricey.  But, it's worth it.  Lots of different flavor combinations, really good drinks, always friendly service even though it's always slammed every time I've been there.  I think dinner is much better than brunch but everyone raves about their brunch.
I wish we had more privately owned restaurants in the SW and more high quality ones like this all over the valley."	5	DW Bistro	4.5
"Was told to try this place if I wanted good breakfast food at a good price and friendly service. They were right.

Pros: Large variety of food options, all very tasty. Big menu but plenty of simple options which many breakfast places try to avoid now a days by being too fancy. Service super friendly and the owner is always there yucking it up with customers.

Cons: Not the most happening location, but not bad.

Will definitely eat here again."	5	Mr Mamas	4.5
I like this place. I've heard others describe the "freshness" as not so good, I suppose I'm not as much of a sushi snob. I thought it all tasted very good and they have a lot of different choices for dishes, not just sushi. The black cod was great and they have a lot of different rolls. I go here once a month or so.	4	808 Sushi	3.5
"Heard about Nobu many times, obviously, but first try was on Valentine's day. The hotel couldn't get us checked in so we had to go in t-shirts and shorts but the hostess didn't give us any grief when we explained our predicament.

Pros: Food was very high quality and the service was very fast. That's about it.

Cons: There were no frills. It was almost boring. Decor was nice, but it was just kind of boring. Mostly because the service was TOO fast. That may sound strange but they were at the table every 2 minutes with another dish or to ask us to order more. It just seemed very rushed. We tried to take our time and talk but we were done with our dinner in under an hour. That was the pace they set. Which is great for turning tables but it wasn't the most pleasant experience. The cost of many of the dishes were insanely over-priced.

I would go here again (if someone else was paying, haha), but wouldn't make it a romantic evening. Food was pretty great."	4	Nobu	4
"Via Brasil is very similar to all other Brazillian steakhouses we've all been to. Except it's a little bit pricier and the meat selections aren't quite as extensive as Texas. Service was decent, just not as authentic or friendly as Texas.

Pros: Food good, not great. Convenient location.

Cons: Pricey, not as many options as other similar restaurants, service just okay.

Would eat here again if someone has a gift card or something but won't go out of my way."	4	Via Brasil Steakhouse	4
"This place is near my house and great for a late night Mexican craving. Nothing special about the food but pretty awesome that it's 24 hours.

Pros: 24 hours, convenient location, decent food.

Cons: Service is always poor and unpleasant. Quality isn't consistent.

Will eat here again when I get the late night urge."	3	Don Tortaco Mexican Grill	2.5
"Great service, good food, nice views - especially from the patio\/deck, strong drinks.  What more could you ask for?

The lighting is romantic, the service was very good, the food was certainly good.  Not an extensive menu and maybe a little overpriced, but all in all I would go again.

If you show up early, do the zip line with the local discount, it's a fun 2 minutes."	4	VooDoo Steakhouse	3.5
"Came here for lunch. We've been to other Sammy's before, this one was pretty much the same as every location. Service was adequate, food was okay and prices were inflated.

Pros: Food is decent, not great. Duck tacos were okay (not as amazing as advertised by friends), pizzas are good, not great.

Cons: Way overpriced for the quality. Not exactly an affordable option when you consider what you're getting in terms of quality, taste and size.

We don't eat at Sammy's very often and that probably won't change."	3	Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill	4
"I grew up in Las Vegas and have heard about this place for many years. My brother is a huge fan. We had so much hope and expectations. There was an hour wait but it was Saturday so that's expected and we anticipated the food being great so we stuck it out. We were really really disappointed.

Pros: Old school style, big portions, very cool (but busy\/tacky) decor, real mob family type motif which was cool. Menu was on the wall and very simple, which is convenient.

Cons: Food. We didn't have a single good dish. Mozz sticks were not hot, and the outside crust was ""homemade"" but tasted like stale cardboard. The salads were Hurricane Katrina flooded with dressing, I like dressing, but dang the lettuce was floating! The free wine was very watered down, but what do you expect for free? We had Lasagna, one of my favorite dishes at every Italian restaurant, and Ravioli. The sauce is absolutely gross; It tasted like canned tomato paste, and not even the good kind. The sauce was so bad, I only ate about 1\/4 of the Lasagna and that was a struggle. The raviolis weren't bad if you scraped off all the tomato paste. A good sauce is like one of the main guarantees you can expect at a good Italian place. For the sauce to be THAT bad, it was just utterly shocking.

We will not be eating here again or giving them another chance. Unless they come out with some sort of press release saying they've completely overhauled their sauce recipe."	2	Battista's Hole In the Wall	3.5
"I'm shocked at all the poor reviews. I've always been a fan of Red Robin. They definitely tend to overcook the burgers and you're lucky to get any pink at all but they're still juicy and tasty despite that.

Pros: Big fat steak fries with seasoning and smothered in ranch, doesn't get much better than that. Burgers are always tasty, even if usually slightly overcooked. 

Cons: Would like more pink on the burger and faster service.

Will continue supporting all Red Robins and getting my usual Banzai burger."	4	Red Robin Gourmet Burgers	2.5
"The pictures for this place looked amazing, they were mouth-watering.

We waited an hour for a table, which isn't that bad considering it was Saturday night so you can't be mad about that. One annoying part though was that they had plenty of open tables on their patio but they don't let you sit in them even if you've ordered drinks from the bar. You must stand at the bar or wander around the courtyard. The bussers would jump on different parties the instant they sat down with their drinks, claiming the tables were for parties being seated... the problem is parties were never seated in those tables. 

The food looked amazing in person as well. The problem was that everything was very heavy handed. The bacon jam was great for the first bite or two but just had so much pepper and spice that it was overwhelming and you couldn't even taste the bacon. The deviled eggs were pretty good. The mac and cheese was DRENCHED in truffle oil. I can still taste it a week later. We absolutely love mac and cheese, even when it's not that good it's still pretty good (kinda like pizza), but they had so much truffle oil on this stuff that it was gross and inedible. The pesto flatbread was pretty boring and uneventful, also unfulfilling. The lamb was good.

Pros: Drinks were strong, everyone was friendly, food came out in a fairly timely manner.

Cons: Food wasn't very good. Tons of open tables with no parties being sat and can't sit in bar area even though you're drinking. Everything was pretty pricey for ""tapas"" style small plates. I don't mind paying a premium for good stuff, but not for heavy handed, over seasoned stuff.

We probably won't be eating here again, too many other places to try."	3	Carson Kitchen	4.5
"Been here a few times and they never disappoint. The service is always attentive and helpful and the food is always top notch.

Pros: Food is incredible (except the Oso Buco) and authentic, service is always professional and inviting. Big wine selection. Lots of great seafood options.

Cons: If you've never tried the Oso Buco and don't like soft\/soggy texture stew type meat, do NOT try it. I didn't know what to expect and I know it's a famous dish so I had to try it once. Next time I'll stick to the pastas which are perfect.

Will definitely continue eating here and loving it."	5	Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar	4
"Ate here before a UFC event. Nothing special, no one pleasant.

Pros: It's not far from the Arena? Big selection of beers and plenty of TVs.

Cons: Food options were limited and they weren't that good. We only got a bunch of apps, but usually apps are killer so we were disappointed. Service was not very friendly and quite slow.

I would try this place again on a less busy day and try the entrees next time."	3	Michael Mina Pub 1842	3.5
"Typical smoothie shop. I came here at the last second before they closed to get a smoothie for my sick girlfriend. They didn't give me any grief, I apologized and ordered one smoothie, they made it quickly and I was on my way.

Usually I go to different locations and get a sandwich or wrap and a smoothie and it's always good. Consistent quality and fair customer service.

Definitely over-priced for what it is, but they're all the same price."	3	Tropical Smoothie Cafe	2
It's pretty good.  It's the closest Thai food to those of us in the far SW and it's decent.  A lot of dishes are rather bland like others have said but if you ask for more spicy (like level 10) then it'll have a lot of kick. Definitely over priced as 3 entrees will go for like $45 bucks but like I said it's decent and I'll hit this place up again for takeout when I'm in the mood.	3	Benjarong Authentic Thai Cuisine	3.5
I think the food is always really delicious, especially their muffins.  Every single muffin is incredible but especially the carrot raisin. The service can be hit or miss but it's never poor. They're usually very busy on weekends so obviously be ready for that but I've never had to wait for a table.	4	Mimi's Cafe	3
"I have eaten at both locations in Las Vegas and they're both excellent.

Pros: Food is always great. I've never had a single bad dish and tried many. Lasagna is my absolute favorite and it's smothered in cheese, it's incredible. Drinks are always good and if you sit on the patios you get great views at either location.

Cons: None, place is pretty great

I will definitely continue eating here as often as possible"	5	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
"Decent concept but the food is rather bland, the decor and environment are very ""cold"" and uninviting. The prices are too high for what you get.

The gnocci was good and the service was good both times I went but the rest of the food was very bland and\/or rubbery.

Sucks because we need more restaurants in the SW, especially privately owned ones."	2	The Sparklings	4
Service is hit or miss but food is always pretty great for the price.  It's not Flemings, or Ruth's Chris but it's damn good and much less pricey than those places. All the steaks are good and the pastas are always very tasty.	4	Outback Steakhouse	3.5
"This is the only nice steakhouse in Downtown Summerlin so I tried it out. It was good, not great. It's in the very back of DTS, so a little hard to find. Very nice decor and good service.

Pros: Skirt steak (MR) was fantastic, Mac n Cheese waffle is unique and incredible, the sweet potatoes side dish was more like a dessert but it was absolutely delicious. Service was very good and polite.

Cons: NY Strip was rubbery and tough (ordered MR), with prices of a high-end steakhouse I expect perfection regarding my steaks. They did try to remedy the poor steak with a free fudge brownie but it was also very dry and not good.

I will probably eat here again, but I'm not in a hurry."	4	Andiron Steak & Sea	4
"I received a gift card to this place so I tried it out. The food was quite good. Definitely for hipsters and trendy stuff abounds. Very tight dining area and long wait times. We were told 30 min wait even though we had a reservation and we ended up waiting 60 minutes.

Pros: Food was good, drinks were strong.

Cons: Bar is very small and they have a LONG wait so you can't even sit at the bar usually. Tables are only inches apart so you're basically having a triple blind date and dinner conversation with the couples on your right and your left. 

I will probably give this place another chance but come at an off peak time."	4	Honey Salt	4
"Beautiful restaurant with great food. High end sushi place.

Pros: Food is always fresh and delicious. I've been here 4 times and never had a single bad plate. They have several rolls with mango, kiwi and I think another fruit and they're all incredible. Really inventive and original rolls that are just fantastic. Plum wine was delicious and strong. Service has always been good and professional. Never had to wait more than 5 minutes, even at peak times. Restaurant always clean, with fancy touches.

Cons: Definitely a high end sushi place, kind of pricey but worth it. No all you can eat option. No happy hour that I know of. Only open for dinner.

Will definitely be eating here again in the future."	5	Sen of Japan	4.5
Absolutely gross. In the summer, their A\/C must not work because it's sweltering in there. Feeling uncomfortable is one thing but then to eat rubbery fish? Gross. I've never said fish\/sushi wasn't "fresh" because I'm not even sure what that means, but I would apply that to this place. I felt sick WHILE eating it. Service is very poor, no one is friendly and those things could be overcome with great food but sadly that's not the case. Tried it twice, never again.	1	Inaka Sushi	2.5
"Absolutely the best fast food burger on the planet. Period. End of story.

Pros: see above, best tasting burger with lots of cheese and any toppings you want. Never a long wait even when the line gets long. Fries are big and natural and they serve a ton of them per order. They have the giant Coke machines with thousands of varieties of flavors.

Cons: No drive-thru. Quite pricey for fast food but worth it. 

Will definitely continue eating at every location as often as possible."	5	Five Guys	4
This place is good. They have all the typical Hawaiian stuff and it's always good. Prices are in line with what you'd expect, they're always friendly and never takes very long, especially if you call ahead to order. BBQ Mix is great and usually my go to dish. This place is far superior to Island Flavor and really the only good Hawaiian food joint in the far SW.	4	Ohana Hawaiian BBQ	4
"Pros: Food came out very fast, and it was really good. Very fresh, high quality. This is the reason for the 4 stars, nothing else was good but food was great.

Cons: 1 hour long wait on a Tuesday at 6pm. This isn't exactly ""prime time"" and the wait for just two (2!!) people was insane. When we were sat, we were crammed so close to our neighbors we might as well have been eating together. Took a while for server to get our drink order, took a while to get drinks and refills. Service was lackluster, no personality, no smiles. Location isn't great or easy to get to. Lot's of douchey smokers out front right outside the entrance.

This place has great food, but they need to expand to a bigger location if they're so busy. There are plenty of sushi places that have great food and don't make me wait all night just to sit right next to strangers. I probably won't go back to Goyemon despite the good food which did come out very fast after ordering. I'd suggest you try this place for lunch."	4	Sushi House Goyemon	3.5
I eat here all the time. Service is always pleasant and fast and food is always ridiculously good. I've seen a bunch of celebrities in here too, from TJ Lavin to Frank Mir, there's always famous people eating here.	5	Stacks & Yolks	3.5
"A lot of people rave about Smashburger so I tried a few different locations starting with this one. I don't understand the hype. It was just okay.

Pros: Food made quickly, none of the locations was very busy.

Cons: The burgers are quite small. I brought this up and they told me some story about how they're smashed so it's the real weight or something I didn't understand, all I know is the patties are super thin and not very big\/filling. The menu is very confusing, just imagine the opposite of the In-n-Out menu and that's Smashburger, a bunch of different screens that don't actually explain anything and it all seems the same. The burgers are overpriced, they're charging Five Guy's type prices but offering 1\/2 the meat and 1\/4 of the taste.

Will not look to eat at a Smash again but wouldn't refuse if someone else really wanted it."	3	Smashburger	3.5
"Best. Meal. Ever.

Our service was a British lady who was very long winded with thorough stories and explanations of every item and especially the crab and different kinds of oysters. She was fun and polite.

Pros: Food was incredible. All the oysters were delicious, my first time having stone crab and it was succulent and amazing. Steaks were cooked absolutely perfectly and delicious. Sides were all fresh and plentiful. Creme Brule was outstanding. Not a single thing to complain about. Refills came quickly, ambiance was nice, service was top notch and what you'd expect from a fine dining establishment. Joe's has it's own Valet separate from the main Forum shops so make sure you find it and use it.

Cons: Price? But, you understand you're going to a fine dining steakhouse so if you aren't prepared to laid down a couple hundred, you're an idiot.

Will definitely go again for another special occasion."	5	Joes Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab	4.5
"The best parts about this place are the beginning and the end.  The cheeses are all fantastic and interesting.  The dessert is absolutely incredible and really the highlight of the meal.  Don't fill up on overcooked mediocre meats, save room for the insane chocolate covered everything!

Overpriced for having to cook mediocre meats on your own and not knowing how to cook in broth without a timer and so many pokers in the pot.  But, it's a fun experience.

I will not go for dinner again (entrees are just so so and insanely pricey for what you get) but I will go just for dessert some night, it is THAT good.  I would only give 3 stars if the chocolate fondue wasn't so amazing."	4	The Melting Pot - Las Vegas	4
"I have heard many people talk about Mon Ami for years. Finally got the chance to try it out on a non-busy week night.

Pros: We requested to sit outside on the patio and the view of the strip and Bellagio fountains was absolutely gorgeous. Food was okay, hit and miss.

Cons: Horrendous service. Our service was not friendly or pleasant and ridiculously inattentive. We asked the busser and other servers for help a half dozen times. Our entrees came only minutes after the apps, no one likes when that happens, I expect more consideration from a nice place. The food only so so. The shrimp cocktail was good, the oysters were not; they were enormous and sandy. The wild boar was soggy and bland.

Probably won't eat here again. I heard from a current server that things have been going downhill for a year due to poor management."	2	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"Meh. Lots of small annoyances and not much good to tall about.

Parking lot is very cramped and congeated. But worse yet, the spaces are all mini spaces. If you drive an suv, you're almost touching both lines simultaneously. I have a small car and had to squeeze out of it.

Not enough space in the dining room, it was packed for lunch. The lady at the counter just kinda looked at me instead of greeting. Then barely holds her hand out to return my card, I had to lean over the entire counter to get it back. I say thank you, she says nothing at all.

Pork carnitas plate. It was decent, kinda small. Took 25 minutes to come out. 25 minutes. Horrible.

When they deliver your food, they don't say anything. Just drop it off. You then have to get up, find your way to the fork and napkin dispensers and get your own stuff.

All in all, the food was okay, but I won't be back. Way too many inconveniences and lack of pleasant service attitude"	3	Phat Phrank's	4
"Took my entire staff here for dinner. This place is HUGE and beautiful as others have said. Food was very good, better than other teppanyaki places I've been to. Our chef was slightly on the boring side, not bad but not good.

Pros: Food was good, it's always fun to watch your food made in front of you. Quality was higher than other teppanyaki places.

Cons: Very pricey and not really worth it except for a celebration or your first time. Our chef was a little boring.

I may eat here again if looking to celebrate or for someone's first time, but won't seek it out."	4	Benihana	3.5
First time here andthe food was good but the cashier and bartender were extremely rude hence the reason for the low rating.	2	Evel Pie	4.5
My family and I stayed at the Palace Station this past weekend for three nights; as my son was attending a soccer tournament. Our experience upon arrival at the hotel was far from being pleasant. We were assigned a room in the courtyard building. The room was small, smelled of musk and infested with smoke. The floor was dirty, the bathroom was filthy and the bedding was not fully made. Only a fitted sheet and flat sheet was on the beds. The beds were hard like cardboard and loud anytime you moved. There were also dead roaches in the room when we opened the curtains to look out a filthy window. The food in the restaurants was decent and decently priced however the service was extremely slow. I would not recommend this hotel or ever stay here again.	1	Palace Station Hotel & Casino	2.5
This place is great as a last minute stop before heading back to your room to get ready to go out. Wish they were open later because I would love it as an after club snack but either way worth it. You get to design and create your own pizza with any and all toppings for $12. Yes a little pricey in my opinion but your in Vegas. They have awesome quotes all over the walls and are located underground at the MGM. Unfortunately not much of a view but nicely hidden off the beaten path	4	Project Pie - MGM	4.5
Only 3 stars because the quality is only ok but.... what more could you ask for. It's a buffet! They haves tons of options. The sushi isn't bad. They have unlimited beer wine and champagne. The prime rib was fabulous. The crab legs were dry and the dessert was lacking in my opinion. I would have killed for a warm brownie. But over all a good choice and yummy. Great when you can't decide what you want.	3	Bayside Buffet at Mandalay Bay	3
I've been to various Habit's in LA & Orange Counties and even in Las Vegas.  Each time we have enjoyed the food and service.  The burgers are great as are there salads.  I enjoy going there even more then I do the In & Out burgers.	5	The Habit Burger Grill	4
Used to spend about $1500.00 a month here when it first opened but like all businesses downtown they tried something new, and changed the menu. They quality is steadily declining. Seems that people who are friends of employees get their food faster, the person who got special treatment and I know each other. The shrimp dish they added to the menu tastes like crap. Last time I'll be here. Bye Felicia	1	Carson Kitchen	4.5
Came in twice, wasn't impressed both times, poutine is not authentic had some pizza chimichanga things I came in once at 4pm and at 10:00pm same results. I tried!	1	Naked City Pizza Shop	4
This place is awesome the bartender Brian is very attentive, you know you're in good hands when your bartender never leaves your drink empty. The nachos are amazing, jalapeño burger is awesome. Saturday nights are karaoke night pretty fun	5	Brentwood Cafe & Tavern	3.5
Completely and utterly awful.  The service sucked, the food choice completely lame, and the shot glasses were a 1\/2 shot.  The seating is cramped. Don't bother with this hole in the wall.	1	Home Team Sports	2
Ok seriously, I rarely ever post reviews. But if they mess up your order for a pickup. Then you call and drive to get a new one and that bowl is still not good. That's bad, I'm upset because I used to love coming here. The first spicy chicken bowl I received when I got home the chicken was dry, burnt sauce not good at all. I call and tell them about this and the guy on the phone just laughs and says "I'm sorry, I can give you a coupon for a 20% discount for next time." Ummmm no. I'm hungry now.. So I told him I would come in with the bowl and show them so they can replace it. I get their frustrated already the cashier wasn't very nice and had resting bitch face. Whatever. I get home and same crap. If I'm going to pay  $10 for a spicy chicken bowl come on dude. It should be pretty decent. I could've got a better one from jack in the box for half the price.. Never again. They need to get their shit together and hire better cashiers with good customer service. Same with the cooks.	1	Teriyaki Madness	4
Fail!!! Don't not go here endless you like crappy Chinese food. Huge portions but not tasty at all. I ordered the teriyaki chicken lunch special. Which I asked for white meat chicken which was $1 extra charge.. Nasty and messy the chicken looked weird and uncooked. I will not be back. Waste of money.	1	Golden China	3.5
This place is gem. A little ways from the Las Vegas strip, but worth the short drive. We opted for the Hibachi grill. The food was excellent. Our chef, Will, made the entire experience even more enjoyable and humorous. Not going over the top and corny like other teppan chefs. I definitely recommend this place and will return the next time we're in the Las Vegas area.	5	Jjanga Steak & Sushi	4.5
There are not too many places that I can say I am greeted authentically every time I walk in the door - this is one of those places.  I come once a week minimum, and I drive a little out of the way to get here.  Often, I sit with my son and quietly enjoy a game of Sorry, one of the many board games they provide.  On other days I relax at one of the many places to sit and read one of the gently used books that fill the cafe's shelves.  I come for the lack of pretense and I come for the coffee.  There is disparate art on the walls and your concern, comfort, and happiness is top priority right when you walk in.	4	Grouchy John's Coffee	4.5
"It has finally happened - I've been moved to write my first review!  I've always known this buffet to be the most friendly buffet for my vegetarian ways, but today it was elevated to a new level. I asked my server about a particular item on the buffet and before I knew it I was being guided on a personal vegetarian tour of the buffet by a chef.  He walked the entire buffet with me going over every item that was veg or vegan. The item I asked about (vegan bolognese) is no longer served, but that was no problem- they would make it for me!

The taco bar would also make tofu or garden burger tacos on request. Want rigatoni without meatballs?  No problem. Want a vegan pizza? Done. Don't forget about vegan ravioli.  Of course this is all in addition to the clearly marked vegan soup they always have. 

If you are veg in Vegas and want a buffet you really can't go wrong here. The thing that is most impressive here is when I ask ""does this have meat in it?"" The answer is always confident.  If the person behind the line does not know, they will find out for you."	5	The Buffet	3.5
We love this place! !! My husband and I went here for dinner and we will definitely be back.  Food was delicious and customer service was awsome!	5	Rhythm Kitchen	3.5
Excellent food and great waitstaff! This place is always packed and serves breakfast lunch and dinner 24\/7. Jo Anne was great, not very often do you have the manager working this hard and waiting on the customers. The rest of the staff were all very friendly and working non-stop	5	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
Excellent steak! The waygu steak was amazing, the waitstaff is efficient and fast to take care of your every need.	5	Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak	4
I have ordered food to go from this place a few times.  At first it was very good.  The chicken adobo has always been good.  The kare kare was good the first time but then they started replacing the oxtails with other types of beef and the kare kare was not nearly as good.  Other times they simply ran out of the oxtails and didn't offer the kare kare.  The inconsistency results in my 3 star review.	3	Cutting Board Filipino Gastropub	4
My boyfriend and I was going off Yelp reviews and decided to check out Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar. It was all so good. We especially loved the mac cheeseburger!!!	5	Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar	3.5
Wanted to try the new buffalo chicken sandwich . I waited about 8 minutes in the drive through to get it. And when i did the bottom bun was full of sauce and all soggy there was WAY to much sauce on it , plus it was really cold sauce. When i bit into it. The sandwich was extremely hot. And the chicken seemed hard. So basically it was a combination of cold because of the sauce and hot because the chicken was hot . I threw it away after 1 bite. Never going to that location again	1	Arby's Roast Beef Sandwich Restaurants	2.5
I come here often with my family so this review is long overdue. The frijoles staff is always friendly and the food never disappoints. I usually order the mini tacos, shrimp cocktail or nachos.  Green and red salas are at each table and you can't leave without  trying an Agua Fresca.  The food is made to order and although a bit pricier than your typical Robertos or other taco shop...you get what you pay for in quality.  We will continue to visit this restaurant :-)	5	Frijoles & Frescas Grilled Tacos	4
Ate here today with my family. The staff was very friendly, restaurant was clean and food was great. I ordered a salad with shredded pork and the spicy cheese sause was yum!  My husband ordered a burrito and was also very happy. We will return.	5	QDOBA Mexican Eats	3
Best combination rice ever!! I always order it when I eat here and that's what keeps me coming back	5	China Gourmet	4
Another awesome meal!!  My husband and I love this place. The Mulitas are a must try :-). Everything's fresh and authentic. Just Come prepared to pay cash. No Debit or CC accepted. Prices are cheaper than Robertos.	5	Tacos El Compita	4
"My friends are super fans of Taco Bell, so they were super excited to visit Taco Bell Cantina. What's so special about the Taco Bell Cantina? Well, for one thing, they are open 24 hours a day. They also serve alcohol, which is a plus since Taco Bell is already drunk food.

Other than the chance to get a beer or alcoholic twisted freeze, the menu is the same as any other Taco Bell. But I do like that they display your name on a screen when your order is ready to be picked up."	3	Taco Bell Cantina	3.5
This place is the BEST.. Great food n great service.. Can't ask for anything else..sarah the host is awesome.. Shes always friendly n fulfills all my requests.  Whenever we visit Serranos we asks for Cristela as our server.. Cristela is friendly n on top of things. She's very knowledgeable on the menu n always recommends what to order.. I have never been disappointed with anything she has recommended. This is one of our goto places everytime we visit Vegas n will never stop going.	5	Julian Serrano Tapas	4
"My friends and I stopped by to watch the game on a Sunday. We did not expect that Wing King would be a stall inside of the bar, Shooters, but it all turned out well. The bar is a dive, but Wing King has a few tables off to side by their window.

We ordered 14 lbs of wings, since their sign said that there would be about 7 wings per pound, but the staff informed us that a large order had just come in and they may run out of wings. They offered to substitute some of our wings with tenders. We told them that was fine and we ended up getting what must have been closer to 20 lbs of wings and tenders! (see all my pictures, that's everything we got). 

I prefer dry rubs and wings to sauces and tenders, but overall, I was pleased. We got 8 different flavors, but the extra hot and the spicy garlic Parmesan were my favorite by far. The service was friendly, and probably gave us extra food to make up for having to mix wings and tenders"	4	Wing King	4
"My friends and I came here for dinner at the recommendation of the bachelor's girlfriend, mostly for their truffle cream sauce. It's a nice restaurant, with modern decor and very hip looking staff. We were seated very quickly and they brought us water and a complimentary bread basket.

Our waiter told us the specials as he took our drink orders. I opted for their rigatoni in black truffle cream sauce special. It was good, but way overpriced at $44. Black truffle is a pricey ingredient, but they could have added some meat or rigatoni to it. This was a pretty small (but filling) dish.

It was a good meal, but not one I'd go out of the way for."	3	Fiamma Italian Kitchen	4
"I've been here many times and every time Ive eaten here i forget about it. Which tells me one thing.. it wasn't memorable. Anyways I've never done a review for this place so here it is..

We were greeted n seated right away.. But the place was empty so.. We ordered chicken noodle,  upon, salt n pepper calamari, and lettuce wraps.. Everything was goood.. Nothing special.. Just plain decent. The only thing I would say I didn't like is the calamari, not salt n peppery at all and the batter was greasy and doughy. My chicken noodle soup was ok.. Wasn't bad. But the service was great... Again I'm sure it was due to being empty.  I'm not sure if I'd come back.. Maybe is someone wanted it bad n treated me to dinner;)  other than that I would not crave this place at all."	3	Dragon Noodle Co.	3
"One of the few places on the strip that is still a great deal. 

With the days of $7 mini-waters and $25 basic burgers Las Vegas on the strip is freaking pricey. The good news is that there are still some great value for money experiences like the Wicked Spoon. 

My experience was weird in that while standing in line a woman behind me passed out. The staff handled this super well and discreetly (minimizing what was clearly super embarrassing for her) and had a staff doctor checking her out in minutes. The good news is she had clearly been partying a bit hard and was dehydrated and low on sugar and they had her fixed up quickly. 

Anyway back to the review. My waitress was amazing. She remembered my name and was super attentive without being intrusive. I didn't drink any alcohol at this meal so she kept the tomato juices coming. 

Food was pretty good. I started with breakfast where my egg was clearly free range (super bright and firm) and perfectly cooked. I then had some smoked salmon with capers, tomato and onions. I then followed this up with an amazing fruit bowl and yogurt which was very very good. It tasted home made and was really nice. 

The sushi was ok. It wasn't bad it just wasn't super amazing like in a high end sushi place. Still for $35 you really can't complain!  

All in all there was much more food than anyone could eat. Great selection and somewhere I think I would visit again!

Like I said for $35 it's actually a great deal. I felt I got much more value than what i paid and would recommend. 

Best bit is it's not far from the tables like some of the other places so you are not wasting a bunch of time trying to find the place instead of gaming."	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"I been a fan of Chef Stacey since her catering days.

EVERYTHING she makes is wonderful and will have you craving for more. The nachos are outstanding, even so that I can get two meat-loving preteens to beg me to take them back for more.

I've always been weary of kale chips until I tried hers. Crazy seasoning and a depth of flavors made we want them over my usual seaweed\/nori snacks. 

If you want food that looks good, tastes good and IS GOOD FOR YOU, this is the spot."	5	Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan	4.5
BEST JAPANESE FUSION I'VE EATEN....EVER!!!! With my husband being Japanese, he has very high standard for Japanese food. We absolutely LOVED this place! We ordered 5 different things from the main dinner menu and it was all AMAZING! The chocolate banana cake for dessert is to die for! So in love with this place. I can't wait to visit Vegas again just to eat there!	5	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
This has to be one of the worst burgers I've ever had.. Not just that the service sucked.. We arrived n they advised us it was 20 min wait.. So they asked for our cell # and said they would text  us when ready.. Well 20 mins later no text.. We go check n she says it's ready.. Where was the text?  Anyways we sit down n we don't get waited for a while..a table behind us who got sat after us gets served first. I ordered the drive thru burger which is a two patty burger w cheese lettuce tomatoes n onions. We also ordered fries n onion rings.. When I got my burger the bun was not soft at all. Was dry n on the harder side.. The meat patties were dry.. How can you screw up a burger.. So the burgers were not a hit so I relied on the fries n onion rings to appease my appetite.. Well wrong.. The fries were each one inch long n seemed like they were left over bits from the bottom of the fry basket.. Horrible.. The onion rings were very greasy. This place is a no go.. Pls stay away.. I rather goto McDonald's  n I'm not exaggerating.. Just horrible.	1	B&B Burger & Beer	3
Came to Vegas for a weekend trip. We are here in Vegas about once a month and always stay at Aria because of the awesome treatment we receive as platinum mlife members. Hearing about how good Herringbone is and looking at the pictures, we wanted try it out. We have tried almost every restaurant in Aria and love them all. Also Raos in Caesars Palace. We walked to Herringbone on a Sat at 1230pm for lunch\/brunch. We walked up to the host and I told them party of 3..She looked at my daughter n immediately told me its 21 and over only. I said ok then..and walked over to Bardot for brunch. The host did not give us any explanation on why, but for a restaurant at 1230 pm, in the afternoon, for brunch, to be for 21 and over only...what is that all about??? Never heard of such a thing. It's not we were going there at 10pm where I know some restaurants turn into a night club or some sort..but at 1230 pm in the afternoon??? Really Herringbone..Well..it's no loss for me, there are plenty of other restaurants I can choose from in Aria.. Herringbone...you guys might want to rethink your policy since a lot of families that visit Vegas have kids and you are losing a lot of valuable customers. Anyways you have lost one valuable customer here..I won't be visiting your establishment again.	1	Herringbone	4
This place is not worth it at all.. I got the burgers here and they r so tiny i could eat ten of them..they remind me of mcdonalds cheeseburger.. And what gets me is that there is always a line? you kidding me? I much much rather have in n out burger. Better yet try Burgr or Holsteins. I give it 2 starts because even though the food sucked, the employees were nice	2	Shake Shack	4
We came here for brunch and all I have to say is.... YUM! The pastries r to die for... So Ooooo gooood.. And the hunters waffle was awesome.. The staff was friendly n attentive.. I definitely will be coming back.	5	BARDOT Brasserie	4.5
"I might give this place a 3 1\/2 stars. This place opened up a week ago and i just had to try it because it is at monte carlo where i usually stay at.  Let me first off by saying the service itself was very good since one of the main guy Cory came to our table asking us how everything was and making sure we were happy. He even gave us a complimentary shashito pepper app which was very good..Thks Cory..ok now for the rest..

We ordered housemade pickles, pork shoulder bun, steak with nori, chicken wings, shrimp ramen, and mushroom ramen.. 

The house made pickles were actually good..fresh and tangy and refreshing. But for $9 not worth it. One of the server also came and picked up the dish without asking us if we were done with the pickles and took it away when we had one pickle still left in the dish. for $9 im going to eat all the pickles but was unable to since the server took it off our table.

The chicken wings had a good taste to them and i enjoyed it for the most part.. I would like the chicken wings more well done and crispier than how it was served . but overall not bad. $9...same price as the pickles which makes no sense.

The pork shoulder bun was good..very good flavor..but the bun was cold. Im sure sitting outside played a role in the bun being cold . but i kinda expected a hot soft steaming bun. But maybe thats how its suppose to be served..not hot. The bun was $9..FOR ONE! cmon..i surely thought it was served with two..but they did warn us it was just one. 

Steak Nori was very very good..good flavors and the meat was tender and the nori was dry and crispy..how it should be..the mushrooms on top had a very nice flavor..but for $39 not worth it at all..

The shrimp ramen was good for the most part..the only thing was the broth..it tasted very shell fishy..the noodles were cooked good and the shrimp was awesome..but the broth taste was a little off. The ramen was served in a tiny bowl which seemed like a large drinking cup..$22 not worth it at all.

The mushroom ramen was good i enjoyed it..no complaints there at all..the mushrooms were good, the tofu had good flavor, nooodles were cooked al dente which i like. the broth had good flavor and i love soft boiled eggs and it had an egg in it which had a soft yoke. Again served in a tiny bowl ..not worth $17.

Finally the shasito peppers..only complaint is ..wish it was cooked lil bit more..but thats just how I like them but this one was free so it was the best!!

Ok...overall not bad..flavors were there but the food could be better..Cory kept asking how we liked it..and we told him it was good..i really didnt complain to him because my MAIN problem was the price and portion size which he cant really do anything about. Would i go back to Yusho?....maybe if someone treated me..but i would not go there again with those prices..the prices were ridiculously high for the portion size and the quality. 

Cory..lower the prices and give us bigger portions..then maybe il return..anyways thks for the experience:)


Update: 11-29-14 visit..

I revisted this place because i was inthe mood for some ramen..I figured its been a while so they mustve improved in some of the negatives i mentioned  above. Well it didnt.. the portions r still small(ramen). The only thing they did was serve the ramen in a bigger bowl making it seem like the portions are bigger. I got the kimchi ramen and the broth was sooo plain..needed spices or seasoning or something. Anyways i wont be coming back to this place unless im forced to, too drunk and dont know any better, or because im starving and thats the only place open."	2	Yusho	3
This place is just awesome.. Great pizzas n great salads.. I did a custom pizza n i love the crust.. Very light n crispy n the specialty salad they had for  a limited time was just pure heaven.. Unfortunately it's only for limited time.. But I will definitely be going back and back and back to this place	5	Five50 Pizza Bar	4
Il make this review short and sweet..awesome food.. been here few times and every time we have received top notch service. But the winner here is the food. From the simple taquitos to the chile colorado..perfectly seasoned, well cooked, and decent size portions for the price..i enjoyed it very much and i will definitely be back..its a must try if you are in mood for some mex food in vegas!!	5	Javier's	4
"Ok it's more like 2.5 stars.. Il make this review quick n straight to the point..the food is good.. I ordered the pad tai,  pad see wu,  Isaan sausage,  stuffed chicken wings n hot n sour soup.. Liked everything especially the stuffed chicken but not worth the wait and my biggest downer.... The portion size! . I know plenty of Thai restaurants w same quality food w way bigger portions.. I get the food is good but give us more!

One more thing.. One of there desserts was the mango w sticky rice. When i tried to order it they said mangos were not in season... Uh I just bought mangos at the market n had mangos at a restaurant in aria.. So how can it be out of season.?"	3	Lotus of Siam	4
"Ok what can i say about Rao's...WOW!!!!! this place is amazing!!! we ordered the gnocchi with meat sauce, lasagna, fusili with sasauge and cabbage, meatballs, and grilled veggies. First the gnocchi, im a gnocchi lover and ive tried gnocchi pretty much everywhere and these were up there with the best..the sauce is just spot on. The lasagna is to die for..the layers and goodness and the sauce and cheese..wow. the fusili with sausage was awesome also..full of flavor and just yummy in my mouth. All these great food for a great price..we got all the above entrees plus a salad, soup and an ice tea all for under $180..plus the portion size is well above normal. We left the restaurant with full stomachs unable to eat dessert which is unheard of for us..anyways im definitely coming back for sure. 

The only thing i was gripe about is the info shows casual attire..well casual to me is just that casual..i went with jeans and nice shirt and shoes and my hat..they asked me to take off my hat at the dinner table which i dont mind doing ..but dont say its casual attire then. i say it should have a classy title than casual"	5	Rao's	3.5
Came here w the work crew.. They told me it was goood.. Got here and we had to wait a few minutes for our table to be ready for our large party. Once it was ready they took out drink orders right  away. As for food. I ordered the cesar chicken wrap.. Big mistake!  It was plain n boring.. Just a tortilla w lettuce n chicken piece w fries on the side.. Everyone ordered something else n looked goood. My friend had the  chicken curry pot pie n it tasted good.. I'm getting that next time.. Other than my order the food being plain the service n everything else was good. Our server was on top of our drink orders n brought us whatever we needed. Thks guys.. I will be back	4	McMullan's Irish Pub	4
Cmon aria. What's going on here.. What happened to your portion size.. Why can't you stay consistent. First I wanted the corn beef hash n you guys are out of the only thing I was craving.. So I got the chicken n waffles which I get all the time.. Before it was a big piece of chicken breast n then you guys switched to chicken strips n back to the breast which I don't mind.. But give us a good size chicken breast instead of a tiny piece I can eat in 5 bites.. After finishing the chicken w each bite of waffle I still have 1 waffle left over.. I mean the chicken was tiny. I come to aria cafe all the time.. My daughter loves it n so do I.. But be consistent please.. I advised my server n his excuse was it looks smaller because it's on a oval plate instead of round. No.. Its small because it's small.	2	ARIA Café	2.5
Ok i had a chance to go back to Toms Urban to try it out again..Compliments of Doug Winter..I want to thk you Doug for getting back to me and giving me another chance to try out Toms..Im glad you did nad im glad i went back..I never had a problem with the food..the food was awesome...gotta try the sin city burger and the wings or one of the best wings i have ever tasted. Anyways this review is not about the food, we already know the food is good. Its about the service and overall experience. I want to say the service was top notch..Veronica, our server, was on top of it and brought was everything we needed. She came by our table asking if we needed anything and didnt ignore us. Doug Winter..thk you again and i will definitely be coming back to Toms again.	5	Tom's Urban	3.5
Im a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay..When i heard about this place i knew i had to try it..Well i did and I LOVE it..from the burgers to the fries and onion rings. I loved the curry ketchup. The burgers are your high end burgers..so its not cheap but well worth it. If you are a big burger fan you have to try this place whenever you are in vegas.	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
We were invited back to try Cucina again and this is an update on my past review. First off,  the service was top notch and of course the food was awesome. Dave, who waited on us, was attentive and made our dining experience awesome.. We ordered the pork steak, linguine w clams, chicken, sausage pizza, and cured beef with cheese. We cleaned up the plates and did not leave any food left on the plates..The food was good the first time and even better the second time. But more importantly we were treated like VIPS and i just want to thank Evan and his staff for making that happen..thks Evan. We will definitely be returning soon.	5	Cucina by Wolfgang Puck	4
"I don't know why I came here again.. Came here before n it was just of.. It's a buffet so how good can it be.. We ended up waiting almost 2 hrs during lunch. So don't come during busy hrs cuz you will end up waiting. 

Most of the food was dry n left under the heat lamp for a while. N there were alot of food that wasn't replenished. I'm not going to go through everything I ate cuz it'll be a long list. But it wasn't worth the wait n price. Save your money n goto a nice restaurant. No buffets!"	2	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"I know I can't expect too much from a buffet but this buffet was not good.. The food seemed like it was left out too long n tasted old.. I'm not going to go into each things I ate but even the desserts didn't taste good. They also use tiny cups for water so they have to keep on  refilling them... Let me give u a tip.. Use bigger taller glasses it will help w refilling often. 

If u want a good buffet goto bellagio or cosmo.. Those r my 2 fav"	2	The Buffet at ARIA	3
I made reservation and came here on a Sat night.. I assumed it would be busier but it wasn't. We were seated almost immediately. They sat us at a table right next to the lobster tank which was kind of cool. My daughter loved it. The atmosphere was chill n clean. The service was great.. We ended up ordering Naan bread, salad, fisherman's stew, n gnocchi. Everything was great.. No complaints regarding taste.. If anything I would say to portion size is on the smaller side. The fisherman's stew had a good taste to it.. The broth was on point along w all the seafood. The gnocchi was great also.. Not your typical gnocchi. But tasted like the outer was cooked longer like it was fried. But very good. Anyways I would return and try something else. But guys.. Pls make your portions larger for the price u charge.. Thk u:)	4	Harvest by Roy Ellamar	4
"I love this place and always received great food and service. We come to Vegas about 15 times a yr to enjoy good food and to maintain our platinum status..Well not so much in my last visit.. Came here with my girlfriend and daughter and ordered our typical dishes. Cesar salad, Minestrone soup, spicy rigatoni, spaghetti with red sauce, and cream spinach. 

We received our bread and complimentary sliced sausages and cauliflower. All of them tasty and awesome. Once we were done with the bread basket I asked our server if we could have more bread.. He said sure and never brought it.. I waited and waited but our other food started coming out..First the salad, and still no bread. After we finished the salad I expected the soup we ordered. Well no soup. I waited and waited and no soup. The next thing they brought out was our dinner plates with new forks and knives. Well then comes our main course. But wait ..whats missing..the cream escarole. I tell the guy, who was in a suit, I imagine hes one of the managers, who brought out the food that we are missing the cream escarole and the bread I asked for 15 minutes ago. He said ok sure il get those out in a minute. Well minute turns into 10 minutes. By this time we are almost done with our pasta without the bread and the escarole. Our main server comes to our table and asks if everything is ok.. I tell him no..first, we didn't get our soup, second, I asked for bread multiple times and still didn't get it, third, I'm missing my cream escarole. 

At this point I was beyond pissed because we couldn't really enjoy our meal without everything we ordered..its one of my pet peeves when restaurants screw up my order. I told our server I wanted to cancel my escarole and no longer wanted it. He told us he forgot to order the soup and the escarole...what?? you forgot..really? For a high end restaurant I expect servers to put in our order right. Not having one dish just ruins everything for me. Anyways...I was not happy thoughout our meal. After all that I still ended up tipping our server..I don't know why but I did. If I go back I will not be going back and having the same server serve us. NEVER AGAIN..thks carbone for a not so great dinner experience."	2	Carbone	4
ok ive been here twice so far and both times ive been very satisfied..both times i got the ox tail chili fries which is a must must try..its sooo good..the first time i made my own burger which was good but i wanted to try one of their specialty burgers..so this time around i tried the Ronin burger which was awesome..the meat is so juicy and tasty and the toppings were spot on..I will definitely be back and back and back!!	5	Bachi Burger	4
"I had a layover at a hotel on the strip last night, and was craving salad, so I to plan uber (about $6) out here for a fantastic dinner. I had the Manager's Special with half a turkey wrap, a bowl of veggie soup, and a trip to the salad bar. At around $10 it's by far the best deal on the menu. 

Service was attentive, and everything on the salad bar was well stocked, even during the busy dinner hour. The next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back!"	5	Jason's Deli	4
Nice warm ambience, it's very spacious and good for large groups. Oxtail ramen is what we tried. From previous post they have worked on cooking the oxtail longer and it came out very tender. Their broth was lacking flavor and the noodles that came with the oxtail ramen also not your typical ramen noodles, came out a bit over cooked and mushy. House fried rice was ok. Can't go wrong with fried oysters, nice and light panko batter. This place has potential.	3	Ohjah Noodle House	4.5
"I gave them 4 stars because this place is nice and a clean. This place is fairly big and has several tv's. They have a full bar.They are very attentive and the food came out at a decent time. 

On their food I'd give them 3 1\/2 stars. The Mussels Oreganata was very good, not over cooked, the panko crumbs gives it some texture and they give you extra bread to dip in the sauce. My husband and I are more on the savory side when it comes to flavor; my scampi stuffed chicken was a little on the sweet side, It was cooked perfectly and not dry though. My husband got the Al's special pork chops which were very tender and juicy, still more on the sweeter side than we'd prefer. Overall nice place we go again to try other things on the menu."	4	Zest - Bistro & Bar	4.5
Love this place, AYCE sushi, cheaper than a la carte. Rarely ever get disappointed, except for the time they sat us at the table closest to the restroom I think they were having plumbing problems that night, since then they have fixed that problem. The only thing that is not part of then AYCE is the hamachi collar  boo! Have yet to try their ramen after 11pm.

Busy for a Wednesday night at 9pm. Tonight we ordered shrimp, crab, clams, and mussels a pound of each. Normally the shrimp is the first to come out but we ended waiting just about 30 minutes for my husbands shrimp, while everything else was brought to our table in a matter of 10 minutes; due to the fact I seen one of the servers bring our order of shrimp to a different table and when she was told it was the wrong order, instead of asking the other servers if another table ordered it she just brought it back to the kitchen.  Asked a server about it and she said she would check on it. She came back to refill our drinks and again said she would check on it, asked another server about it and our order was finally done. My husband and I are too polite to complain, because at the end are bellies are still satisfied ;)	4	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
I give it a 4 because of the consistency  we get when we come here. We always sit at that bar and they have an awesome Happy Hour menu, appetizers for $3 and certain alcohol like Absolut vodka for $3. We get our wings naked extra crispy with sauce on the side and the wings still come out juicy and not dry at all. We stick to mango habanero which is sweet and has heat to it (a little goes a long way!) last night we tried the spicy garlic sauce which has a good combination of sweet and spicy, it almost taste like garlic aioli.	4	Buffalo Wild Wings	2.5
It was OK.  Different selections as far as burgers go, for sure. They were pretty tasty but I've had better.  Pricey.	3	Bachi Burger	4
Meh.  I didn't see what the hoopla is all about.  They say there's a pound of lobster in each roll; not sure what measurement scale they're using.   It was nothing to write home about.	2	Lobster ME	3.5
Used to be much better and was our (my wife and I) go to breakfast restaurant.  Since the new owners have taken over we've tried multiple time to give it a chance.  The friendliness is not there (we miss you Joanne and Esther!).  The service each time since the new owners took over is not the same at all. The food was OK but better when Esther, the owner, was also the head chef.  We miss having the "old" Divine be our go to breakfast restaurant.	2	Divine Eatery	4
Love it!  Coming from AZ, we are so picky  when it comes to Mexican cuisine.  We've  found that the salsa is always an indicator of what is to come and theirs was perfect in texture, flavor, and zip.  That said. their lunch entrees were great and we'll be anxious to return.	5	Mariscos Playa Escondida	4.5
"Went for a business dinner.  The inside is def old school with autographed pics of celebs on the walls, but that adds to the coolness of the place.  There's live entertainment, but it's not loud; just classy.

The waiter was top notch with his service and suggestions for wine and entrees.  The wine was very good that he brought out.  I had veal picatta;  it's hard to find good veal but this was great.  Very tender and flavorful.  The picatta sauce was very good as well.  Had pasta on the side and the red sauce was good.  Not my sauce, but good.  The two gents that I was with enjoyed their meals as well.

The whole experience was very nice and we were not rushed in the least.

I'll be back with my wife (who is Italian)."	4	Italian American Club Restaurant	4.5
"My wife and I love this gem of an Italian restaurant.  We love the ambiance, Silvia, the impeccable waitress, Ozzie, the affable owner and Johnny, the perfect bar host, and, of course the food.  The food is what people come here for and we have never had anything that we did not enjoy very much.  Their seafood dishes are wonderful; full of flavor, not over priced (very reasonable) and a good portion.  Their pasta dishes are great; Veal Parmesan?  Great!  Eggplant Parmesan?  Wonderful!  Appetizers?  Terrific!  Wine list?  Decent as well.  Desserts? MMMMMMMM!

The staff here is personable, attentive, and really care about your experience.  We love to come here and the only reason we don't frequent more often is so that we don't get nonchalant about it.  In fact, we are going to be there tonight and made reservations.  Hope to see you there!"	5	North Beach Italian Bistro	4.5
My husband and I went for dinner last night. Not my first time and definitely not my last! It makes a night out so nice to go somewhere you receive great service and food. As a vegan, it's also nice to have more than a couple choices and Hussong's delivers!! A very enjoyable evening. Thank you Itsel ... you set the bar quite high for other servers!!	5	Hussong's Cantina Boca Park	3.5
"This place caught our eye during our stay in Vegas. We decided to try this place during lunch time so it was pretty empty and quiet. We asked to be seated indoors and it was clean so no complaints there. Our server was very attentive and made sure to answer any questions we had about the menu. She also told us about some of the specials not listed on the menu, all which sounded tasty.

The food was delicious. My burger was cooked exactly as I asked and quite filling. All in all, a solid, well cooked and seasoned burger. The one thing that I really recommend is the garlic and herb fries. They were the stars of the entire meal. Of course, my breath was kicking after, but it was definitely worth it because they were that good. The sweet potato fries were also pretty nom. A word of advice, if you do want a side, split it with a friend, it's a lot for one person.

If you are in the mood for a burger, and not a fast food burger, try this place. It's a hidden gem in the mall."	4	Stripburger	4
Love the food, HATE their service. But it only seems like its at the  sahara and ft. apache location!  The other locations are so nice and friendly, this one questions you when you call to say your order is wrong. I called the other day to say my salad was wrong and the 5 mangers there couldn't answer the phone so I got some smart ass girl to ask me if I was sure I was wrong! I hate that its the only one near work so I have to go to it.	1	Cafe Rio	2.5
Very clean pub, the friendliest crew I've see in a long time !! The best chicken strips and garlic fries !! Must try !!	5	Blue Dogs Pub	3.5
Great vegetarian options for subs. The bread is fresh and very good. They have vegetarian turkey from Worthington or better than meat for the philly cheese steak or morning star farms if you would like. Fresh veggies on it as well. Great vegetarian options. Recommended	5	Capriotti's Sandwich Shop	4
Mushroom quesadillas phenomenal. Chili relleno was excellent and the banana cream pie was perfect.  This is truly a great restaurant.	5	Mesa Grill	4
"I really enjoyed the calamari side dish never had it like theirs and I was very surprised to find it was delicious. 
I ordered the spicy noodle bowl and it was very tasty, slightly spicy & sweet at the same time. I hope I can find the same dish in San Diego when I leave Vegas. 
Definitely worth stoping by if your in the mood for this food."	5	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5
"It's between a 3-3.5for me. 

I checked in and got a free potato taco, shrimp taco, fish taco, beef(carne asada) taco, and a side of rice. Don't judge, I was very hungry haha.

The potato one was surprisingly good! The cheese complimented it very well.
The shrimp taco and fish taco were my favorites. Thad a good size shrimp with them! And the fish had a nice flavor too them!
And I've had better beef tacos, but it was still good.
I absolutely love spanish rice. HOWEVER, this rice wasn't steamed all the way as it was a little hard.. and I didn't like something about how they prepared it..

I also ordered a side of rice, side of beans, and 2 chicken tacos without the tortilla for my friend, and even tho the guy repeated the order back to me, he still gave us the wrong order (gave us the tortilla, no tomato). She just ate it without the tortilla still, but what's the point of ordering it a specific way and clarifying you can do it, but then get it wrong?

All in all, I'll probably be back. I mean, I do love my tacos but only if I'm around campus, because I've had bomb tacos else where!"	3	Baja Bar & Grill	4.5
"Unlike last time, they actually picked up their phone so I was able to order to go.
After finally giving in to my week long craving of ramen, I decided to go with Monta because it was previously my favorite ramen spot. But I think I have given up on this place. I called in an order when I got off of work that way by the time I get there, it would be done. So I walk in right at 930 (the time I said I was gna be there), and not only was my to go order not ready yet, not a single person acknowledged me. I had to walk up to the ladies standing by the cash register to ask about my order. And that's when I saw one of them start getting it ready. So I wait another 10 minutes or so until it's finally ready and I head on to my way. Once I got home, I realize my ramen didn't even come with the meat!!! I tried to call them, but of course, they don't pick up.
 I don't care how good and cheap this place is, I don't think I'll ever be returning. They suck at picking up their phone, they messed up on my food, and I feel like they do enough business to be able to expand yet they leave everyone in this crammed room."	1	Monta Ramen	4
"iHop, where you pay money for below average food, and almost 0 customer service. 
Came here late one day to grab a bite after the gym. I never know why I continue to disappoint myself with ihop, but after this time, I think I've officially given up. 

One time we were here, I ordered their steak and egg hot plate.. and the cook somehow forgot to put my egg on it????

Another time, the waitress came around to grab our order, place our food, and give us our check. I'm not expecting a conversation, but at least a check up on food. Didn't get that.

And this past time, my boyfriend and I decided to call an order for pick up since we didn't want to deal with their customer service. Of course, no pick up. So we drive there to place the order to go, and you see an employee on her phone wandering around, and no one to greet us.

I understand that sometimes when you're out at midnight and your choices are limited on where to eat, esp on this side of town, but ihop will never be one of my choices again."	1	Ihop	2
"While this place isn't amaaaazing, it's definitely a tradeoff.. You want late night pho after a long night of partying (trust me a lot of these people just came from the club\/ a party), they give you somewhat decent food with somewhat decent service. 
Matter of fact, I don't think I've ever been to this place in actual day light, which I'm sure says a lot. But if it weren't for this place, there would have been lots of hungover, hungry, hopeless nights."	4	Pho Kim Long	3.5
"I don't eat Italian food too much so this was definitely a different experience.

It was my brother-in-laws 30th birthday and we came with a party of 16.
The server was knowledgeable on the menu. Recommended a few good dishes. Since we were a party of 16, I understand we probably took a little longer to order as we were all deciding on what to order, but the server did not rush us at all. Everything came out in a timely manner.

They had 3 different types of bread with three different spreads, butter, some eggplant tomato-y dip, and citrus herb olive oil (definitely the best one). Just that alone was yummy. Most of us skipped an appetizer as we weren't too hungry. One guest, however, did order their yellowtail. The few bites I was able to sneak were tasty! It had a citrus flavor to it, and if you know me, then you know I drown everything in lemon.
For the entrees, I ordered their lobster pasta dish. It was very pleasant. With higher end restaurants, dishes tend to be more salty or over seasoned, which I cannot stand, but it wasn't at all. The pasta was thick and cooked perfectly. I was also able to taste the foie gras. I've never had it before and did not like that at all. The guest who ordered it, however, usually loves foie gras and didn't like it either. She said it tasted too bland. She wanted to speak to someone about it, but the waiter hardly checked on us. I also tried the short rib and bone marrow pasta dish. It was delicious. I loved the fried garlic to give it more of a crunch.

For dessert, most of us ordered their Nutella dessert, which by the way, is superb! I grew up on Nutella, and it brought me back to my childhood. It was pretty much sugar donuts filled with warm Nutella with a side of banana ice cream. Yummmmmy. Another couple at the table shared their guava dessert. It was the perfect mixture of fruits, not too sweet either!

Now for the bill splitting. We all individually calculated how much was going on each card, which was extremely time consuming and inconvenient that we had to do it ourselves, since he ""couldnt do it"".  The bill altogether wasn't too bad, and they didn't charge gratuity for that large of a party, but for this nice of a restaurant, I'd expect atleast a little happy birthday for my brother in law, but oh well. The food was worth the price. I recommend it, but I'd have to try other places before I decide on coming back."	4	Scarpetta	4
"I used to always hit up this spot late night because of their hours. It was decent enough to come back each time, but if there were other spots open later, I would definitely go to other spots. I almost always order their local plate, which is beef and chicken teriyaki and 2 spam musubis, and I substitute the rice for veggies because I don't like all those carbs, and I also substitute the macaroni salad for kim chi. I have tried plenty of this other dishes as well, but my favorite thing about their menu is the kim chi, which I'm sure says a lot. It's just an average meal, hence the 3 stars. 

However, the last time we did end up going here, my boyfriend had food poisoning from their curry. And now he won't ever return here, which, I guess isn't too much of a loss.."	3	Aloha Kitchen & Bar	3.5
"This place is rather an experience place, so it's not your typical ayce kbbq. Heck, it's not even ayce, but with that being said, my experience here was phenomenal and I'd like to give a huge shout out to Randy for taking such good care of us. At first I was a little surprised that such a new restaurant had 5 stars, with plenty of reviews to back it up, but after dining here, I could definitely see why.

My boyfriend and I had the beef combo for two. It came with brisket, your choice of beef, steamed egg, and some sort of soup. With Randy's suggestion, we chose the rib eye and skirt steak. Like I said earlier, it's not your typical kbbq so they cook your food for you, in front of you, ( which always makes everything taste better because you don't work as hard haha) and not only that, but the quality of each meat was amazing.
He started with the brisket, which had very little fat (a very good thing). He brought out sushi rice and wrapped the brisket around each cube of sushi rice and dipped it in their hobak vinegar-y sauce. DELICIOUS. I didn't even touch my sesame oil and salt. 
Then he changed the grill and started to cook the rib eye and skirt steak both medium rare.
Another lady took over, Annabelle, and she even asked if we wanted the the fat cut off the steak. She cooked both steaks to a perfect temperature. I ended up dipping the skirt steak in the vinegar sauce as well and it really added to the flavor. And they also put taro and sweet potato on the grill also, which we liked to dip in the cheese fondue they had. The tapas were really good. I liked the bean sprouts and salad a lot.
Just everything was perfect from our server Randy as well as the west of the staff to the dessert(ice cream inside a rice cracker taco... YUM)
I could not rave more about this place...  I enjoyed every minute of it.

The saying ""quality over quantity"" definitely goes with this restaurant, and not only did I get full, but my taste buds were truly satisfied..

 I recommend this place to anyone and everyone."	5	Hobak Korean BBQ	4.5
"My friend took me here and raved about how it was the new ""hip"" boba place in town. And let me tell you, that place is almost always packed! Maybe because out of the two times I went there, it was always later in the evening (the best time for boba is late night), but it seemed like there was almost always a line.
I can't really tell you too much on their menu, because I haven't tried too many options, but I must recommend their mango snow slush. I will forever get this drink. It's a mango slushie with milk and mango jelly. And I love their mango jelly. My friend got the one of their milk bobas, which was also yummy. Their boba alone has the perfect amount of chewy-ness and sweetness btw. I was also able to try a brown sugar and milk boba when I took my cousins here. I don't think it was on the menu, but the fact that they were willing to accommodate her request, AND make it delicious just already puts them at the top.

My friend was pretty spot on with this being the new go-to boba place!! Delicious flavors, yummy boba, and their customer service is amazing!"	5	Kung Fu Tea	4.5
"My boyfriend and I received a gift card to brio and we decided to try this place out for an early Valentine's Day lunch. Everything from the ambiance to the service was fantastic! The decorations all around were beautiful, and the high ceilings with the curtains really caught my eye. 

Our server, Cortney, did an amazing job coursing out our food and handled all of our requests. 
We had calamari and the shrimp & eggplant for appetizers. The runner who brought them out even said they were the two best things on the menu for appetizers, and he was right! The shrimp and eggplant had a peppercorn sauce and grated cheese. SO DELICIOUS. And the calamari had fried peppers in it and came with two sauces, one that was tomato based and the other mayonnaise. For entrees, my boyfriend had crab stuffed shrimp and lobster tail. He didn't care for the orzo and broccoli on the side, but I found it delightful! It also came with lobster bisque!!! And I love lobster bisque. I had the chicken limone. Delicious was an understatement. It was seasoned perfectly & nice and tender. I am so sad that I was too full from the apps to finish it, but at the same time, i can't wait to warm it up later  Cortney boxed up our calamari and my chicken and even gave us to go sauce for the calamari. Her kind smile and great service really made our first time experience a great one! 

Overall, from the low prices, big entrees, cute decor, and amazing service, we will definitely come back!"	5	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
"Two words: FURIKAKE CHICKEN.



Also, their poke is by faaaaar the greatest in proportion, taste, and freshness. But definitely order their furikake chicken, and if you're a small gal like me, definitely bring a friend to share it with because they will give you a look if you dare try to box something up. Haha. The only downside I can think of is that it is 25 minutes away from my house and not open late enough! I love this place and I love bringing people here!"	5	Island Flavor	4.5
"Went here for drinks with a few friends and for it being out of the way, it wasn't really worth it.
As soon as you walk in, you see someone standing by the door, whom I'm going to guess is the host... but doesn't look like one, nor act like one, as we definitely seated ourselves.
For drinks, we had the apple jack, guava something, and then I had asked our server to make us one more drink that doesn't taste like alcohol, but has plenty of it.. and all three of those drinks were disgusting. The ginger in the apple Jack was way to strong, and the tequila in the guava drink overpowered any other flavor in it. Also on a side note, I feel like the bartender was new because when we were watching her make our drinks, she measured literally eveeything.. and it still tasted bad.
So the stars received was for the food! We had the calamari, shrimp grits, mushroom pizza and the bison burger. The calamari was delicious! Had a nice crunch and the perfect amount of seasoning, and the ginger aoili paired really good with it. We also had the shrimp grits. I don't really like grits, so I picked off a few bites of shrimp and that was tasty. I really liked the flavor and the sauce surrounding it.  We also ordered the bison burger. For never having bison before, I felt like the burger was more so plain jane. I've had much better tasting burgers for less money. It did come with fries though. Lastly, the mushroom pizza was a very good choice. You can never go wrong with mushroom pizza with truffle oil. Absolutely delicious. The only thing wrong was that my friend expressed that she didn't want any chili flakes on it, and the server insisted there were none, yet you can literally see the flakes of chili on the pizza. Even after she pointed it out, the server could care less about his & the kitchen's mistake. 
After all of that, we tried to order dessert, but the kitchen was closed. Apparently we ordered the pizza 40 minutes after the kitchen closed, but what good did that do if the server didn't even tell us when last call was??? I thought that was dumb. And mostly the reason for the 2 stars. So we were able to order cookies and milk, which didn't fulfill anyone's tastebuds..
Overall, I wouldn't go back. Even if I'm shopping at downtown summerlin, there are far better bars\/ places to eat at Downtown summerlin or closeby."	2	Public School 702	3.5
"After a long afternoon of shopping, my boyfriend and I were feeling some Thai food. With the help of Siri, we found this location and called in an order for pick up.
We ordered Pad Thai, Rad Nah, and mint chicken, along with a box of rice, all for 23.51! Not only was it inexpensive but it really fulfilled our craving.

What really got me was the mint chicken. Normally, anywhere I order this dish, the meat is always grounded up, which I'm not a fan of, but this place had chunks of chicken. As for the taste of all the dishes, the taste is a little, little bit bland compared to a few other places, but for me, it was fine that way.

The only thing that was off was the ""spicy scale"". We ordered a 3 for everything on a scale of 1-10, and my mouth was burning after a few bites. As for customer service, I can't necessarily comment on it since we just ordered to go, but the lady wasn't rude at all. She said thank you and have a nice day.

This place isn't my favorite Thai restaurant, but I'd definitely come back! It was a very good meal for a very good price :)"	4	Prommares Thai Food	4
"I've been to their other location a handful of times and love it every time I go there. But since I was closer to this location, I decided to give it a try.

The food is the same. Its always just as delicious, but the reason for this two stars was the service. The waitress made it such a bad experience. 

She had an attitude the whole time! From the minute we stepped in, she wasnt even welcoming. She had zero patience for us when we were deciding on chicken or beef (a 30 second discussion). She only refilled our waters once while there were only two other tables here. Not even a smile from this lady!

I love KoMex and I will continue to go, but definitely not this location."	2	KoMex Fusion	4.5
"We had 6:15 reservations as a belated birthday dinner for my boyfriend and it was absolutely delightful from the time we sat down to when we got up and left. 
We arrived a few minutes late, however that was no problem for them and sat us right away. They even asked if we wanted a patio seat, which I forgot to ask for one in our reservations, but was I so glad they still had some available because the view was beautiful!
Now, my boyfriend and I aren't exactly ""foodies"" so we don't judge everything based on every little detail. Good food is good food to us, but we love tapas because it gives us the chance to try plenty of different dishes without spending tons of money. And let me tell you, each dish we had was loaded with flavor and all cooked so perfect, even their cocktails were yummy! We had a total of 7 tapas between us two, and that was just the right amount for the both of us. They even brought out a complimentary dessert for my boyfriend and if I wasn't stuffed, I would've had waaay more spoonfuls!"	5	Lago	4
"I've eaten here once before, and it was alright, not the best, but it was good enough to have me believing I should order for delivery.... Note to self: don't order for delivery.

After ten impatient minutes of being on hold multiple times, I ordered Pad Thai and Rad Na. They said it'll take an hour. AN HOUR. Ridiculous waiting time.

My food finally arrived within the expected delivery time. Pad Thai is my absolute favorite Thai dish, and you can never go wrong with it, but they managed to do so. It was completely dry and lacked flavor. They didnt even throw in a complimentary lime for my noodles (i love lime). My starving self couldn't even finish a third of my entrée before I threw it out. My boyfriend had the Rad Na, his favorite, which wasn't necessarily great either. Rad Na is listed under the noodles section of the menu, which its supposed to be a noodle dish made with vegetables and gravy. But what we got was a dish of gravy with very, very little noodle. I mean, we didn't order a soup dish, so I'd expect a lot more noodles for my noodle entrée.

Those two displeasing dishes were not worth over 20 dollars, and it was definitely not worth 2 stars, but if I hadn't had a better previous dining experience here, it would've been just one star. 


Once again, don't do delivery!!"	2	Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant	4
"Hands down one of my favorite sushi places in Vegas. 
Treated my bf out to a sushi bday dinner and he chose this place. I was a little sketched out bc of the side of town it's on, but this place does not disappoint. 

Their fresh oysters are amazing! I always wish you can order more than one.. the sauce paired perfectly with a good sized oyster. 

We ordered their salmon and garlic tuna. YUM. Such good quality fish, the sauce was amazing and Their fish to rice ratio put the cherry on top!

We also ordered a few appetizers here and there, with the same amount of satisfaction. 

The only thing I didn't like were the actual rollls. We only ordered 2, and they weren't that great. However, it did not bother me as I prefer nigiri over rolls. 

All in all, 5\/5. The servers were fantastic! The sushi was fresh! And the price ain't bad. Love love love."	5	Sushi Hero	4.5
Generally speaking, Roberto's is just one of those fixes you get when your craving carne asada fries. However I'm rating this solely on my experience this evening. I went through the drive thru after work and Gissell was amazing! She was very personable through the speaker and was very friendly when I pulled up. And I mean, really friendly! I enjoyed our little conversation, and she remembered all of my little extras that I like on the side :)	5	Roberto's Taco Shop	2.5
"THEIR MATCHA ESPRESSO IS HEAVEN IN A CUP, ANDGIVES YOU MORE WINGS THAN REDBULL (in terms of caffeine). Don't why I'm in all caps, but it was so yummmmmy. So funny, after I tried it, I attempted to make it at home, but it was not nearly the same outcome... so I guessssss I will make the drive out here. It's definitely worth it! Just hate driving. 

My cousin ordered their tea, and while super fresh and delicious, I just don't go out of my way to order teas other than green tea lol

Andddd my fattieself ordered their s'mores egglette. It's like an egg shaped waffle?? With caramel and chocolate drizzle (i addded Nutella) with crushed graham crackers and marshmallows on top and the ice cream one the side, which makes all the difference to be honest. I enjoyed it separately so it allows me to enjoy the s'mores goodness and the delightful chocolate ice cream separately, but also together whenever I wanted without making my egglette soggy! Cute little spot, friendly staff! Check it out :)"	4	Cafe Summer	4
I don't just get Thai food cravings, I get Buddha Thai Bistro cravings.  I haven't exactly tasted the whole menu, but from the two things I consistently get, I have never been disappointed. Their seafood salad and seafood soup is toooooo die for. You get the great amount of seafood in both entrees, and it always has the perfect amount of  "sour\/lemony" taste to it. Out of all the different types of Asian foods, I think Thai best fits my appetite, and this place just excites every little taste bud! I love this place and I will continue to go back!	5	Buddha Thai Bistro	4.5
"I love my chicken wings and I will always go to Buffalo Wild Wings but I will never come back to this location. Our server, Michael, was extremely rude the entire time and I've never felt so disrespected as a customer.

I dined there last night after a few drinks at PKWY. We sat in the bar area and the bartender\/server had very little patience for us while ordering (even tho the bar was fairly empty). After I ordered, I just asked if he can make sure we have carrots and celery, and I always ask Bc servers have forgotten about them before and he very rudely said yeah, they always come with it. So the food comes out, and he checks on us once. As we were finishing up, we asked for boxes, which took him a while to get bc he was on his phone before giving us the boxes!! then he constantly kept checking on our checks to see if they were ready. we had 2\/4 payments out and the other two were getting their cards out and he didn't have the patience to wait just a few seconds. And I KNOW they do military discount but he couldn't give us it bc there was ""no manager present"", which sure that may be true, but it makes no sense to not honor it.. what if he had a void, cuz I know those need a manager for that?? And even if that was the case, he was very rude about it and we had 3 members in the group in the military..

I understand most people don't like to deal with ""drunk"" people but we werent even drunk or rude. Just a few young adults tryna get some chicken wings. So if you're in the area coming past 11, I would skip the place entirely if you don't want an asshole aka Michael taking care of ya!


My chicken wings were bomb tho btw."	1	Buffalo Wild Wings	3
"I go to jjanga a lot, but I kept hearing so much about this place that we decided to give it a try. And man, it was a horrible experience.

To start this off, this review is a few weeks late so I can't give a better description on the food.. so bear with me. Haha. But some of their fish just didn't sit well. I think their tuna in one of their salads tasted really funky and the texture of it was nothing I was used to.. and i eat a lot of sushi, so with that, I was sketched out and barely wanted to eat anything else. The quality of their food was disappointing for the amount of 5 star reviews they off.

The only good thing was their nigiri. They had a lot of fish for the amount of rice they had.. and they had cute decor.. and that's about it. The customer service was eh, but that's expected from an Asian restaurant. 

Overall, I wouldn't come back. I'll stick to jjanga or any where else other than here."	2	Sushi Neko	4
I am so glad I found a closer Island Flavor. Though this one is smaller (since it's an "express") it's definitely just as delicious! The food quality is always there and the staffs friendliness makes the experience that much greater!	5	Island Flavor 	4.5
"I cannot tell you the amount of times I've been here. I absolutely love this place. Definitely my go-to Thai place, which says a lot since it's about 25 minutes out the way.

Every time I go, we order family style, as the portions are large. I always go with the pad thai, you can never go wrong with pad thai! It's always just as delicious every time.

They also have a lunch special, which is definitely worth the price! The have a handful of entrees to choose from, all of which are delicious. The only thing is you can't substitute the soda for Thai tea (not a big soda fan).

Anyway, I love to bring new people here. It's a small little mom and pop place, which always means better food, bigger portions, and cheaper prices."	5	Thai Room	4
"Went here for lunch on a recommendation as ""the best Mediterranean food"". And I will say it comes pretty darn close. 

I just recently started the keto diet, so I liked that they had some options available. I had the meraki bowl with no rice, no beans, easy tomatoes and olives on the side (I don't like olives) with their gyro meat. It was delicious! All the flavors mixed very well together and made my taste buds scream of joy. My boyfriend ordered the lamb burger and feta fries. He said it was very tender and rich in flavor. And it was way more than filling. He didn't care too much for the fries, but they were still good nonetheless. He liked dipping them in my tzatziki. 

Overall it was very good food and a great experience. We'll be back when we're on this side of town, most definitely :)"	4	Meraki Greek Grill	5
"Only been here a few times but every time I've been in, I was never disappointed! This past time, however, every dish we had was amazing!

We started off with the apple manchego salad. AMAZING. Who would've thought sliced apples and manchego cheese together would make such an appetizing dish?! This is a must order for me every time I'm here. Definitely shareable too!

We sat at the bar, to which our bartender was very knowledgeable on the menu and suggested many items to fit our taste buds\/diet. 
We then ordered their shrimp ceviche, tuna tartare, and scallops ""escargot"" from his many, delicious sounding, suggestions. 

Their shrimp ceviche makes my mouth water just thinking about it. SO FLAVORFUL! Its a little on the citrusy side, but I loved it that way. They came with crackers so balance out the lemon. *droool*

The tuna tartare came with taro chips, which by the way, are my faavorite, so it instantly got a lot of lovinnnn from me. But the tuna tartare alone was delicious. It's basically ahi tuna and avocado, and their seasonings, sprinkled with love. 

And lastly, the scallops escargot was very delightful! Herby, buttery, breaded goodness with a nice lilll scallop in the middle. 


Those four were about 50 dollars, give or take. I absolutely love tapas for the fact being you can try many different options on the menu without breaking the bank. And with that, I absolutely love this place! The portion sizes, yeah they're still small plated, but I feel like they still give you a good amount! We're small girls tho, so that was enough to fill us up without feeling too full

Also, side note, on another occasion, I had their stuffed dates and those are just as bomb as everything else :) try everything! Or atleast what I've mentioned."	5	Firefly	4.5
"Okay before getting into the food, I just want to say that we've been here two other times specifically try their poke and they were out of them both times..
BUT! Third times a charm and they finally had poke. While the food was very good and flavorful, I wish they had more poke with the entrees. It comes in those little 4 oz cups."	4	Makai Pacific Island Grill	4.5
"After a colllld long day, I knew I needed some ramen to fill my stomach, and this was one of the very few ramen places still open at 1 am ( which by the way, happy hour is from 10pm- close!!)

We got seated at the big table. We shared it with 3 other ppl, but my bf and I were on the other end so it wasn't too awkward.

So for the both of us, we ordered:
1 lamb chop
1 tiger shrimp
4 pork bellies
4 beef tongues
Takoyaki
Pork gyoza
Ramen burger and fries 
Half miso ramen with spicy on the side

LOL. I let my eyes order bc I was clearly full before finishing all this food.

The skewers were all wonderful! Priced between 2.50-4.95. For some reason, my first round of pork belly tasted better than my second, but it was still fatty & delicious! The beef tongue was my favorite, but it's always my favorite to order. I could've skipped the shrimp, and the lamb chop was very tender and juicy!

The takoyaki was amazing :) it came with their takoyaki sauce and I'm going to guess mayonnaise? But altogether probably one of the best I've had!

Their gyoza was good too! I've been on a gyoza kick lately so it really fulfilled my appetite. It came with 6, and if I wasn't with my bf, I would've eaten all 6 of them to myself. 

The ramen burger is prolly a 3\/5. It's messy, too soggy, not as flavored as I'd like. If I were to come back, I probably wouldn't get it again. The fries were good tho!

And the ramen itself was good. I had the spicy on the side, but I ended up adding it in after. It was good! Loved the actual noodles themselves. It came with the same toppings as with a regular ramen, just a smaller portion obviously. So I still had egg, pork, seaweed and bamboo which I highly appreciated for it only being 5 dollars. 

All of that food for only 60 bucks!!  All in all, I'd be back bc I love Japanese tapas and their happy hour :) just skip the ramen burger."	4	Izakaya Go	4.5
"I don't care how hungry you are you will always surrender before they run out of food. Don't fill up on the salads and sides just let the meat keep coming and you keep eating. 

Save up and come hungry I think you'll enjoy it."	5	Via Brasil Steakhouse	4
I am so glad Rocco's moved into Village center...The pizza is excellent the dinners are great...the Sicilian pizza reminds me of the pizza I grew up on in Long Island. What can I say, you have to try Rocco's.	5	Rocco's NY Pizzeria	3.5
Always the best place to eat when your hungry and don't know where to go. Always the best. A DOUBLE DOUBLE WITH CHEESE, extra sauce and lots of napkins...	5	In-N-Out Burger	4
They tried.  2 out of 3 meals were good. Pass on the Cobb salad. Service leaves a lot to be desired... Mom was happy. That's what counts. It's Mother's Day	2	Hash House A Go Go	4
This is my wife's favorite pace for lunch. She tells me the staff is wonderful and the food is delicious. She loves the lamb salad she has brought some home and I can tell you the food is delicious and reasonably priced. I say, try it...	5	Crazy Pita Rotisserie & Grill	4
"This place was right next door to the school we had a basketball tournament at so I though I should just check it out. It was an interesting concept having Korean infused Mexican food. I decided to play it safe and got the kimchee fried rice. It was pretty good but it didn't knock my socks off. I tried my friends cheesesteak and that was pretty bomb. I'd be open to coming back to eat here again and probably be a little bit more adventurous. 

The key negative here is the slow service and the fact that they take forever to bring your bill and pick up your check. Was about to give it a three but I guess I'm just in a good mood right now."	4	KoMex Fusion	4.5
"Secret pizza is the place to go for moderately priced pizza in Vegas. Its kind of hidden (hence the name). It is on the same floor as the pool table at the cosmopolitan. My personal favorite is the white pizza with sausage. Its a thin crust pizza with the perfect cheesy flavor the sausage are legit sausage slices and not the kind from dominos. The normal red pizza is also really good too and typically they have more options for it available. 

It tastes extra good after you're done doing your business at marquee and have those drunchies. But the line is pretty long because everyone from the club goes there after. So if youre not going out at night I would recommend eating before 2:00 am because you will be stuck in a line full of less than sober people. 

The pizza makes it all worth it though."	4	Secret Pizza	4
"Ordered the Italian sandwich. It had ham and salami and tomatoes. Overall it was pretty good. It had a lot of flavor. Not filling but it tasted good. Earls is generally a good place to eat before going out. 

Personally im a bigger fan of capriottis. But I'll be back here."	4	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
Only heard bad things about this place but was fighting a hangover and you know what that means....time to get my pho on. Ordered the number 3. The broth was flavorful but I still added a bit of hoisin sauce. Because its hoisin sauce duh. The meet was nice and tender with good flavor. The bowl was very filling. But it was a little pricy for pho but then again it is Vegas so whatevs. Solid choice to get rid of that headache.	3	Pho Da Nang Vietnamese Kitchen	3
"If you want some tasty reasonably priced hawaiian food this is the place to go. Its inside of the California hotel and casino on the second floor. This past time I ordered the aloha breakfast which came with eggs, rice, spam, Portuguese sausage and what they call luncheon meat. Very filling meal and if youre in the mood for breakfast it hits the spot. The spam was  not too soft had a slight crisp to it (just the way I like it) and the Portuguese sausage had goof flavor. The luncheon meat was interesting. I would compare it to a thick piece of bologna. 

You seat yourself here and order at the cashier. There's only one cashier so when it gets busy you may have to wait. They only accept cash here so dont be coming in with a credit card. But then again you're at a casino so getting money shouldn't be an issue."	5	Aloha Specialties	4
This is my second time coming here and I ordered the ronin burger. The burger had an egg carmalized onions in a tonkatsu sauce and I think it was cabbage. Its a decent sized burger and it tasted really good. I just wish that the egg was runnier. We also ordered the truffle fries and sweet potato fries. Which were pretty good. We had two orders of fries and split between 4 people. Most likely youre looking at a $16. But it is well worth it.	4	Bachi Burger	4
"I was pretty excited to fund out the Rio had a hash house a go go. I've been to the one in San Diego was and was blown away by how amazing it was. The portions were huge and the food tasted great. This one however brings shame to the hash house name. 

First off the ambiance of the restaurant is fine. A standard restaurant located in a casino at the Rio. The service here was also decent...no complaints there. The food however was disappointing to say the least. I ordered the corn beef hash which was moderately priced for Vegas food. The plate came out with an unpleasant liquid along the bottom of it and it just got soaked into the potatoes. The corn beef had as much flavor as a piece of cotton. It was terrible. By far the worst corn beef I've ever had. The biscuits looked appetizing. But again....WRONG...DRYEST BUSCUIT EVER and just not enjoyable at all. 

I still love the one in SD. But never coming back to this one. For sure."	2	Hash House A Go Go	3.5
This place is very good. But also very crowded especially late at night after the clubs start to clear. I ordered the adobada tacos which was their version of all pastor. It was very tasty and filled with meat. A pretty good deal for two bucks per taco. I didn't have a chance to try any of their other meats because of the way their lines are set up but I don't know if I need to get anything other than the adobada. Not the best tacos ever but they are very very good.	4	Tacos El Gordo	4
We went here for dinner and the food was great. I don't like most of the bulk style buffet meals Vegas is generally known for, so I looked around for a new restaurant to try that I had not been to. This place was in a elegant setting with great customer service. If you are in Vegas and want a good meal and great service, go to The Steakhouse at Camelot.	5	Camelot Steakhouse	3
Food was great but the communication was a struggle. I would go back simply because the owner cares for his customers and business.	4	Carson Kitchen	4.5
The food was very good. Huge portions! So come hungry! The service was pleasant. The only problems we had were that they gave us dirty plates when we asked for extra plates and they screwed up our check.	3	Rocco's	4
"All food is good here. Generous portions and tasty entrees. The prime rib is as good as the higher end restaurants her modestly priced. There's no place that can compare to the flavorful Wild Salmon here at Ellis Island Cafe not the bland  farm raised junk So called Salmon most other places have. 
Enjoy a very good meal with a tasty homebrew or in house rootbeer at avvery modest price. 
We Always have at least one meal here while in Las Vegas. Enjoy!"	5	Village Pub and Cafe	3.5
Just bad. I went on Valentine's Day and it was a wreck. Service took forever, salad was drenched in vinegar. I asked for water without lemons, got lemons. Another person asked for lemons in their soda and got none. I ordered the deep fried calzone, which came with delicious garlic fries. I ordered the calzone with no mushrooms or peppers, and it was chalk-full of them. I am all for being lenient on holidays, but this was ridiculous. The chicken looked like the inside of a McDonalds nugget, and when someone ordered veal, they got beef. It was almost ground beef, but it was definitely not veal. The waitress tried her best, but it was a failing ship. The entrees that were supposed to have a side of garlic bread, but that never came. The Italian Nachos were pretty good, but the mozzarella sticks had very little cheese. They had two live singers. The first one flat out couldn't sing and the second was in a Frank Sinatra character, lip syncing everything, even with recorded cheering. The manager had to come in the end and comp the whole meal, so at least he knew that there was a problem. Not a good experience at all.	1	Gabriella's Italian Grill & Pizzeria	3.5
WOW! got the asada Arepa with avocado and cheese. Very flavorful with a bold Smokey taste. The texture of the bread was slightly crispy on the outside but the bite is so soft and melts in your mouth! I also tried the chicken empanada. Probably the most satisfying empanada i've ever had. The chicken itself Had a very rich flavor of different spices and the shell is not hard. also, a soft melt in your mouth texture. I would definitely recommend to families and friends especially from out of town visiting. I will be coming back to try more of what the menu has to offer! Great customer service clean and affordable place to dine in  they also provide different kinds of dinner entres if u are interested. Note that Arepas have a hearty stuff and they are 5.50ea. excluding add ons. (Cheese, avo, etc.) ENJOY!	4	Viva Las Arepas	4.5
The thing I appreciate most about this spot Is that its so savory yet its not over bearing with the salt. You know what I'm sayin? I've eased up on my sodium intake for awhile now and I eat with "no added salt" so my taste palates are pretty senitive this place definitely satisfied my savory! Plus, my body appreciated no water retention lol. I've been to many Peruvian spots where they get a little too sodium happy Anyway, I would suggest the saltados plate BEEF & Rotisserie chicken. I was gonna ask for skinless but who the heck I'm tryna fool, right!? lol. chicken was cooked to a perfect tender still sweating in its juices when it was served to me &The herbs, daaaaamn ... A bold rosemary And thyme taste. Smoked paprika and cayenne pepper. Smoked Paprika on errryyythang!!! If you're wondering.. YEAH, ATE IT ALL! anyway, get yo ass over here. Lmao	4	Pollo Inka Express	4
"Came here for beautiful, classy, upscale-without-being-over-the-top brunch spot. But I must say, it was very difficult to find. 

- Complimentary pan epi bread - Yum!! We pretty much killed the whole braided roll because it was that tasty with a bit of butter!
- Bouchon French Toast ($12) - I feel like this name is a misnomer for this dish. It's definitely more like a cinnamon apple custard bread pudding. The decadent apparence caught me off guard - it looks like a layered cake! And the first bite surprised me too - but it grew on me as I ate on. In the end, it was an enjoyable dish, but very sweet!! It looked kinda small, but I ended up not being able to finish it, so don't underestimate it. However, I'm not huge on cinnamon apple so I wouldn't order again. 
- Breakfast Americaine ($22) - Sounded pricy for just eggs, bacon, sausage, brioche French toast - but it also came with a choice of pastry, coffee and juice. Overall, everything was pretty good. The brioche French toast had an interesting crust, the bacon was very good quality. LOVED the chocolate croissant - would definitely pick up at the bakery ($4 value in itself). 

 Overall, my boyfriend wasn't super impressed - but I liked it! I'd definitely come back for a relaxing, leisurely brunch again. And for next time, I've got my eye on that croque madame, yum."	4	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
"Came here for breakfast and felt torn - should I order a savory breakfast or go balls out and go for a dessert crepe? I made the terrible mistake of settling for somewhere in between - I got  sweet brunch item.

I settled on the Chocolate cheesecae crepes ($10.95). Bad move.. I thought it would be more cheesecake-y. It was mostly banana with chocolate syrup in a crepe. I didn't even like the sauce it came with that much, but I did really like the raspberry with whipped cream. Honestly, I wish I had just said - ""Hey. It's Vegas. You're at Max Brenner. Who cares what time it is."" and gone with something ridiculously sweet with ice cream or something. Oh well - you live and you learn! Now I know for next time.

Boyfriend got the Cande's Killer Breakfast Skillet ($14.95), which he really liked. Scrambled eggs, sausage, onion, tomatoes, spinach, fries and mushrooms in a skillet with a a baguette and some choclolate to dip it in. I thought it was good, but wasn't blown away. Would have preferred it with a bit of ketchup. I also got a cafe latte, which was wonderfully foamy and (of course) had two pieces of chocolate which melted their way into the cup. I could have done without the chocolate, but it didn't influence the taste much. I enjoyed it because it helped cut the sweetness of the crepes really well.

I will definitely be back, but for  next time... I know now how to approach Max Brenner. Don't be shy, go for the sweet stuff."	3	Max Brenner	4
"This diner-style restaurant is located inside the Tuscany, a casino where few younger party-folks venture out, and let me tell you... this place is freaking amazing as a 12-5am pit stop after the club for the $3.99 steak and eggs special. 

No, it is not the most gourmet quality steak you will ever eat, but it's a healthy-sized, juicy cut without tons of fat. The taste is decent, made delicious with lots of BBQ sauce. And when it comes to the drunchies when all you want is a satisfying meal for a low price, it's def a great value. Comes with two eggs cooked as you like, hashbrowns (and they're good!!) and with toast of a bread of your choice - makes for a HUGE meal for the price. 

Haven't tried anything else, but that deal alone is worth the trip. And the time window is pretty big - 12am is early in Vegas time!! If steak\/eggs isn't your thing, they have plenty of other menu items and a couple other specials (I think  $5 monster burger?) but really, if you realllyy WANT something else, you're better off elsewhere!"	4	Marilyn's Cafe	4

"In the words of my own personal Vegas Wolfpack, Secret Pizza is.... ""just pizza.""

After hearing so much hype about this ultra secret pizza place on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan... this place turned out to be regular pizza - gooey, cheesy, delicious. But not anything out of the ordinary. We came here for a quick lunch before starting the day (around 1pm - Good Morning, Las Vegas), so there wasn't too much of a line. Took 20 mins to get a mushroom pizza. It was a normal pizza - nothing to complain about. I think the appeal of the place is mostly its secrecy and the fact that it's conveniently located\/open to service the drunchie-driven crowd pouring out of Marquee during the wee hours of the morning.

If you get a single slice at $3, it's a pretty expensive piece of pizza. However, the large pizza was split among 6 girls and came out to about about $2.50 each. They had told us the pizza was 12 slices so we expected 2\/person, but there ended up being 9 huge slices. Maybe someone cut it wrong? In any case, we ended up with one and a half big slices per person."	3	Secret Pizza	4
"Came here for shakes after a very disappointing evening, and it was the perfect pick me up!

I got a Brown Cow (Root beer float + pop rocks + Charbay Tahitian Vanilla Rum) & my bf got a Strawberry Cheesecake (Cheesecake chunks + graham crumble + strawberry swirl + Absolut Vanilla). There wasn't a ton of alcohol in these shakes, but they were so delicious and creative that they were totally worth it. 

Def wanna come back here to try the food!"	5	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4
"Reasonably priced for the strip, and not too heavy in case you're not hungry enough to eat at a buffet. My boyfriend got the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich - tasted just like a Hawaiian pizza, reallyyy yummy!

I got the Chicken Cesar wrap - it was pretty decent. The salad inside was good, but the bread was more of a flatbread than a wrap. In fact, it wasn't even rolled up - just kind of folded together like a taco. Next time I'll either get it as a salad or stick to the famous sandwiches!"	4	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"One of my new fave buffets in Vegas! Very cute interior, and lots of yummy foods! Came in right up at around 2 or 2:30pm for the last hour of lunch to snag the weekend brunch price ($31.95), but stayed until 3:30pm for dinner to have the king crab legs, and avoided paying the dinner price of $39.95 (which actually in the scheme of things is not such a big price difference lol). 

The delicious
+ Fresh, delicious king grab legs!!
+ Tons of shrimp
+ Salmon pizza - Delicious, came with capers. Thought I'd only eat half, but couldn't help myself from eating the whole thing - best Vegas buffet pizza I've had.
+ This super thick cut, fatty, tender bacon with mustard grain on the side. Forgot what it was called but that stuff changed my life. I await the day we are reunited....
+ REALLY yummy desserts! Sampled a cannoli, sprinkles iced rice krispie treat, tres leches and gelato. All were grrreat, but that tres leches was ridiculously delicious.

The disappointing
+ Eggs Benedict - was so excited to see them, but they were very meh!

All of the items out for dinner sounded equally fantastic and tempting, but I unfortunately could not eat any more than the crab legs. Can't wait to come back and try all the dinner items + the supposedly prime rib I didn't have room for!!"	5	The Buffet	3.5
"Omg I am so in love with this place. Located in a near-abandoned strip mall off the strip, my boyfriend and I got here for an early dinner at 5:15pm (they open at 5:30pm) and were very impressed that there was already a sizable line forming along the outside. We had high expectations, and Lotus of Siam did not disappoint.

We tried:
- Crispy duck with panang ($20.95) - SO GOOOOD, I'M STILL DREAMING OF IT! I adore panang curry, and it is seriously done right here! We ordered mild because my boyfriend doesn't eat spicy, but it still came out a bit spicy. But even he LOVED this. While the crispy duck was delicious, I felt it was a little bit heavy for me with all the oil\/frying. Next time, I would order this as the panang curry with beef or chicken ($10.95) and save myself the ten bucks.
- Crab Fried Rice ($12.95) - So delicious and flavorful. No skimping on crab whatsoever! Would order again forsure.
- Drunken Noodle Prawn ($22.95)- My least favorite dish of the night. I felt the large, flat noodles were bland. However, the prawn was crisp and plentiful. Instead, next time I'll try the Garlic Prawn ($21.95) instead.

Our waiter was extremely friendly, knowledgable and helpful. My boyfriend and I had no idea what kind of wine we wanted (they have a HUGE selection!), but he asked us a few questions and brought us out each a glass perfectly suited to our individual tastes. Couldn't ask for a better experience - a definite must visit if you have the time to get off the strip while in Vegas!!"	5	Lotus of Siam	4
"After a long debate, my tired girlfriends and I decided to order pizza hut for a late lunch\/early dinner before hitting the strip. Terrible mistake in choosing Pizza Hut for delivery. Called and asked if they had any deals with pasta (one of my girls waned chicken alfredo), and they offered the $20 Big Box deal, which included 2 medium pizzas, breadsticks and the pasta. Delivery was estimated at 45 mins. Everything sounded great! 

Or so we thought. 1 hour 45 mins, still no pizza. We called to complain - the manager offered us a sorry $10 off our next purchase coupon as compensation. When the delivery guy finally arrives, he has no pepers, no parmesan and NO UTENSILS\/NAPKINS, even though we had a pasta!! Unbelievable. The pepperoni pizza and mushroom pizza were not what I envisioned - we had no idea it would be this weird square pizza, and for some reason the crust was unusually greasy. The breadsticks tasted off - hard, stale and flavorless (and came with no marinara, of course).

In short, this was a horrible idea and I advise you never to make the same mistake I did. Stick to Dominoes for delivery!"	1	Pizza Hut	1.5
"Came here for brunch after an overall disappointing experience with the Cosmopolitan... and this buffet was pretty much mehhhhh.

The salads were pretty good, the cheese selection was nice... the concept of serving the entrees in small individual pots (spoons?) was cute, but the contents of said pots were nothing special. I've always said that it's never a good idea to get sushi at a Vegas buffet, and the Wicked Spoon was no exception to my rule.

However, the dessert was definitely redeeming - the decadent crushed candy and chocolate covered strawberries were amazing, as were the chocolate chunk cookies! The fancy little desserts are fabulous too. Just don't get the gelato, its very ice crystal-y and not too smooth.

The dessert is great, but in general you're better off at Rio or the Venetian for an overall amazing buffet experience!"	3	Wicked Spoon	3.5

Stayed in the grand tower for MDW and overall had a good experience. The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable. The casino floor is spacious with games and limits for every budget. The sportsbook is a little cozy and the book was not diverse in the types of bets you could make, but it was still decent to bet and watch some games. The pool\/lazy river is awesome -- buy the tube and use it all weekend. The food court is mediocre at best. Pan Asia was horrific and the Italian place's breakfast sandwich was very meh. WiFi was free and a decent speed and the overall customer service was pleasant.	4	MGM Grand Hotel	3
"I admit I was a little leery of booking at this hotel based on some of the reviews I have read online, many said that since the hotel is no longer a Hilton hotel it has gone downhill fast. But I decided to give it a shot anyway because they had a great rates for Labor Day weekend. 

When we arrived, parking in the garage had me a little concerned, I didn't see a security presence at all and it seemed a bit sketchy, but ultimately my car was fine when we left. The the staff wasn't super friendly during check in (not surprising during labor day weekend) and much of the clientele looked shady, but the room was great! Very large room, very very very comfortable bed, I wanted to take that bed home with me. I was really impressed by the room, the decor was nice - may be left overs from the Hilton days? My only complaint is the room smelled a little musty, almost like it used to be a smoking room but it wasn't that bad that it overshadowed or was uncomfortable. 

I also loved the access to the monorail, it was super convenient since the hotel is on the northeast side of the Strip, it made getting to the other hotels so much cheaper and faster than taking cabs. We didn't spend much time in the casino so no real comments there but I would definitely stay here again.

If you are looking for an inexpensive stay in Vegas, I would definitely recommend LVH."	4	LVH - Las Vegas Hotel & Casino	2.5

"This review is for the Mirage ""Cravings"" Lunch buffet...

My wife and I went for lunch last week. Man, was I disappointed! I read reviews that the ""live"" stations were good, but what I experienced was pretty sad for a supposed ""upper tier"" buffet.

The wait to start the buffet wasn't too bad, about 8 minutes or so. It was a Wednesday around 1:00 pm.

It's like a giant horse shoe layout with a very odd and VERY limited amount of choices. Very spread out. It started with so so pizza, a few pasta dishes I just wasn't interested in and a carving station that had prime rib and turkey, (which wasn't bad, to be fair). 

Next was the lame taco bar which really seemed out of place and again slim pickin's.  Then there were a few odd fish choices, but nothing that really looked to good. The Chinese dumplings were one of the few highlights. 

The sushi was pathetic. No actual fish to be found. Argh

There was a somewhat okay cold cut and cheese selection though with a few nice salads and the gelato was excellent. The dessert plates were pretty good.

The wait staff was attentive and did take care of the beverage needs well.

But, over all, I wouldn't spend 19.99 plus tax per person on this lunch again.

I guess I should have gone to the Bellagio.

Oh well, live and learn."	2	Cravings Buffet	3
"After reading reviews and other stories about this place, and since I had a coupon, I decided to give it a try.

If you can get past the odd, ""grandma's bathroom"" aroma of the casino, then you won't mind the semi dark, and much quieter restaurant that is completely closed off from the rest of the place, thank goodness :)

The food was good, the sides are a la carte, but not over the top priced. My porterhouse steak was cooked exactly how I ordered it and my wife's shrimp scampi was very good.

They had a very nice wait staff and brought a nice variety of hot rolls promptly to our table when we arrived.

We didn't have desert, but the selections were okay.

Overall, it was pretty good. If you want a more expensive, romantic setting, albeit old school Vegas, try going to the Ranch Steak House at Binion's. It'll cost more, but the views are really cool as the night lights of Vegas come on."	4	The Flame Steakhouse	3.5
"food was not bad, but servers aren't attentive.
I ordered coconut juice but i didn't get while i received all food. And they don't serve the food even though they know food is ready from the kitchen. Also, I asked lemon slices for water 3-4 times but they didn't give until I finished my dish. Their service was Horrible!"	1	Archi's Thai Kitchen	4
"I came here about 6months ago and it was great I had a huarache de Asada which was delicious!
But I'm back 6 months later and I ordered a carne Asada sope which was horrible the meat was inedible it was way too salty it made my mouth feel like sand paper out of how salty it was I told our waiter and his explanation was simply that's how the meat is seasoned (over seasoned) and the sope itself was not cooked through! Not coming back its way to over priced and the food is not worth it!  0 stars!"	1	Cilantro Tacos	4
I know it's been a long time but this is the first time I have ever been to the Cheesecake Factory This place had a very nice ambiance and had a steady flow Had the steak tacos was very enjoyable And the portion my bigger then I expected The service was good and very attentive My only complaint about this place is the menu is pretty overwhelming and extensive But I will definitely be returning	5	The Cheesecake Factory	3.5
My hubby and I went in to have some dinner and well he ordered his usual 4 al pastor tacos with pineapple and they were mediocre at best well I decided to try the new steak nachos they added to their menu and well sense they're NACHOS I asked to get NACHO cheese on them and the cashier said it would be $2 extra for NACHO Cheese on my NACHOS I told her that I didn't want the shredded Mozzarella I only wanted the nacho cheese and she went and asked one of the cooks if it was extra for the nacho cheese and he said yes and I explained that it didn't make sense that the steak fries were $10.50 with nacho cheese and the steak nachos were $10.50 with the shredded mozzarella and all I wanted was for her to switch the cheeses she said that they couldn't do that and that it was $2 extra which equalled $12.50 for a medium portion of steak nachos never have I paid so much for nachos and they were not that great not only that but sense the cook got my order wrong and I returned them and asked to get my order exactly how I wanted them sense I did have to pay extra he got mad and gave me the most unappetizing nachos ever the first order look delicious and I was excited for them and then I noticed they got my order wrong so when I returned them I could hear him yelling in Spanish saying what the fuck it's just cheese and why are people so dam picky and come on if I pay for something and end up having to pay extra for It I want exactly how I ordered them! I honestly regret buying them and going there for dinner they have really bad customer service and the cooks are assholes the cashiers laugh at people that come in and they're all around mean they lack customer service I really hope they close this place down!	1	Taqueria El Buen Pastor	3
Just spent $15 on 4 pupusas and I was expecting them to be amazing but they each have a pound of grease and hardly have a filling. Definitely not going back! My family usually makes them and well I guess I'm just used to fat non greasy pupusas. Lol nonetheless these weren't great at all.	1	La Costa Del Sol	3.5
By far the best Mexican Restaurant I've been to! The food was delicious and their complimentary chips and salsa are fresh and yummy! Definitely recommend this place! Chicken enchiladas are perfection and the steak is seasoned to perfection and well just really enjoyed dinner here! Can't wait to come back!	5	Maria's Mexican Restaurant & Bakery	4.5
Came here for some pho cause I'm sick and pho makes me feel better and honestly I wish I hadn't it's was not good at all. The meat on my pho was disgusting and old and it made my mouth itch! Ugh! Never coming back!	1	Pho Bistro	4
"Bad bad service ! The lady in the front is rude and nasty she doesn't wash her hands! 
She left me waiting on drive thru for an hour at 103 degrees outside! She was awful! I don't think I will ever come back here again!  I love me some good food but I also love me a good service with it!  The food is ok but they won't work with you if you want to change your order up a little!"	1	Arandas Taqueria	4
Breakfast was bad. Coffee was bitter. Omelette was so so. Potatoes had been in Warner so long they were hard and had a crust so hard you could not bite through it. Breakfast is better somewhere else.	1	California Pizza Kitchen	2.5
This is our favorite bar! Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They have the best beers on tap and their food is nothing short of amazing!	5	Aces & Ales	4
This place is so good! The service was absolutely wonderful. Our waitress was so nice and efficient. Not too expansive either! Everything is made fresh and you can definitely tell! They so t have very many rolls listed on their menu, but they waitress explained everything on the menu without us even asking, she also told us that if the roll is t listed they are happy to make anything!	5	Sushi Hagi	4.5
Yum, yum, the best pizza ever! I always order a margherita pizza or "the don" with fresh garlic and fresh basil added. The crust is light and crispy and the sauce is very flavorful. The spinach and kale salads make a delicious accompaniment. If you join their online club, you get a free pizza on your birthday!	5	Grimaldi's Pizzeria	4
This is my go-to place if I want a light and huge fluffy omelet. The pancakes are just ok. The only thing I feel they are missing on their menu is some type of steak, like country fried steak. But I will definitely keep returning for the omelets!	4	Original Pancake House	3.5
Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants in town. I'm obsessed with the fresh guacamole dip and queso fundido served with fresh homemade corn or flour tortillas. Try out an organic Cadillac margarita too and you will not be disappointed!	5	Lindo Michoacan	4
Wow! I am addicted to the breakfast egg croissant sandwichees. ! I have ordered through Postmates, and the Nutella Latte is amazing! One of these days, I hopefully actually make it in to the restaurant.	5	Sunrise Coffee	4.5
Came here on a busy weekend night and although the service was good, the food was just ok. I had a shrimp, fish, and fried avocado taco and it didn't taste very authentic and lacked flavor. The tortillas were a bit greasy as well. The black beans were bland and boring and the margaritas were pretty weak with way too much lime juice and hardly any tequila. The best part of the meal was probably the mango habanero guacamole.	3	Hussong's Cantina Las Vegas	3.5
"Wow...this review has been a long time coming. I used to adore coming to El Dorado as I have always loved the food and the service until recently. They have this new lady called Maria who is HORRIFIC!!!!!  She is the craziest person I have ever seen. We complained about a piece of metal in our food to Maria and after we showed her, she called us liars!!!! And then when we asked to see the piece of metal again so we could take a picture, She threw it away and acted as if we put it in there ourselves. This used to be my favorite restaurant but if they keep someone like Maria, I will never be back.  I cannot believe Maria took that piece of 
metal, disregarded it, and she did nothing to remedy the situation. I hear she is a manager. Wow, just wow! With someone like that, I can see this place declining in sales. Good luck with Maria El
Dorado!"	1	El Dorado Cantina	4
This is one of the best restaurants in town for Italian food. I can't get enough of the chicken riggies (slightly spicy), eggplant Parmesan (not breaded which makes it even better), and the cheese plate. They have a great selection of wines and a dim romantic atmosphere. The service has always been on point as well. Highly recommend!	5	Mezzo Bistro and Wine	4
Great food. Great service. A little hard to spot from the street but easy parking close by. Definitely plan on stopping in every time we're in town. Owner definitely cares about his business. He's cooking, bussing tables, bringing food out, AND checking on customers. Great place to stop in.	5	Dougie J's Cafe	4.5
i really like this place kinda reminds me of Hawaii Its a bit small The prices are cheap and was really busy with people waiting outside I had the Miso Ramen was good I kinda dont like the noodles Reminds me of Top Ramen  i kinda like the thicker noodles But was still good the broth was really good I can't wait for my next time here and try something different	5	Monta Ramen	4
Just tried to place i was curious what the hype was all about When i first walked it had an interesting decor  This menu is a little different then your usual sandwich place like ( subway jersey mikes etc...) I ordered that meltdown and i really loved it It was juicy and it melted in my mouth This place was not a let down  i drive by this place everyday and can wait for my next new journey into this place	5	SkinnyFATS	4.5
My husband and I ate here the weekend we got married and I will never forget it! He got a steak that was delicious and bigger than his head, and I got delicious seafood pasta. Our waiter was incredible and recommended to us a fabulous Riesling wine. Our waiter was very timely and had a great personality. The food was very expensive but that weekend it was worth it! It tastes so good.	5	RM Seafood	3.5
I just ate this place looks kinda small but i think i didn't really look at the other part of the restaurant i think We came at the end of happy hour literally minutes And was offered dinner was a little out of budget cause we only go out for lunch cause of the prices We let the server know that we were going to leave But then was offered a lunch menu which made us stay The service was really good  and nice But the main entree was real bland I had the same dish at another place and tasted exactly the same So maybe its just the type of food Or i should try something different	4	Nittaya's Secret Kitchen	4.5
This place is just an average teriyaki place Had the combo the chicken was ok a bit on the dry side The beef was the same a little dry with not much flavor Kinda of disappointment Down the street at Yogis is the bomb beef teriyaki The decor was nice Wasnt terrible but wasnt the greatest I dont think ill be back or maybe i should try something else	3	Teriyaki Madness	4
I like this place I ordered the BBQ combo plate The food was really tasty and they give you a good amount of food  I got there  pretty late and still had a good amount of people in there and I have  always wanted to try this place They always have people inside  and looks pretty busy Definitely will be giving this a try again in the future The service is friendly and greets you with a smile !!	5	Ohana Hawaiian BBQ	4
I really like the way the place looked Wouldn't know it from the outside We were greeted with a  smile from the hostess and was very friendly Our server was ok ( seemed a bit rushed )  We ordered our food and the tofu soup was pretty simple and good But when the entree arrived  ( i ordered some ginger dish with beef I thought the portions were kinda small But would have been worth it if it was good But unfortunately it was not  The first bite was cold?? I had to stir it up a bit And it was  a bit warmer but still only warm not hot  The rice and salad was good But the entree part was extremely bland It absolutely had  no seasoning or flavor My mom ordered the sweet and sour and she thought it  was delicious  and good Didn't get a check back from the server which was kind of let down : ( Would i return to this place?? I dont think i will If i do it will be a long time before i will	3	Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant	4
Just visited this place It was pretty good It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst I would say its better then average So if you're having a chinese food crisis and its close to where you live i would give it shot I really like you can order everything online Thats why i tried it	4	New York Chinese Restaurant	3.5
This place is ok Ordered take out and they got my order wrong? This girl was nice  But for the food It was pretty bland not very tasty It wasn't terrible  but it wasn't good I dont know why it got so many high reviews ?? That is the only reason i tried it?? Theres many more chinese places to eat that are good But i always like giving a new place a shot   More then likely will not be returning back to this place	3	Oasis Asian Kitchen	4.5
Just had lunch today and the staff appeared friendly  Which was inviting   Looked pretty dead which kinda worried me  But ate there anyways  Was greeted with smiles  and was sat down I guess our server was busy cause  ( i think ) Our host took our drink order and told that server would be with us  Our server ( Gary  I think ) was nice and attentive Had the chicken and gumbo both were pretty good The other items seemed a bit pricey but i guess barbecue isn't really that cheap i thought the portions were decent but really didn't see any other dish portion So really can't help you there I will be back and try something different next time	5	Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que	3.5
i really like this place I wasn't really into eating sushi this day And most of time we go out for lunch This place always looks dead But then again it lunch time The food is good and really flavorful And the prices are very good The service is always good here And definitely  would recommend for sushi and non sushi eaters Cant wait for next visit	5	Kabuki Japanese Restaurant	4
This place is a bit small but i like places like this But it was completely dead  I server kept staring at us I dont know if he was zoning out or what and really didn't smile at all He did welcome us and his service was good The food was also good and will probably be back the next time I'm on this side of town	5	Yummy Grill & Sushi	4.5
This place is Ok nothing special i usually only go out for lunch so we tried here I saw there lunch specials and wanted to try them But when i got there they gave us a sushi menu and a dinner menu I had to request a lunch menu which was kinda of annoying We normally  go out for lunch cause its cheaper  I understand the company is trying to make money But you should give the customer a choice rather then forcing it on them There was only one other table in there My food was ok but my mom really like hers The odd thing is that they serve there food with French Fries?? What Japanese restaurant serves french fries?? And they had there cleaning stuff all around which was kinda of turn off  The place looks a little run down and dirty Service was good But dont know if ill give it another try	3	Jjanga Steak & Sushi	4.5
this place is pretty good Im not sure about gourmet burgers? I thought they were kinda expensive then other restaurants but you do get unlimited fries  i think our server was a little sarcastic??  But nice I'm in the industry so i get how someone can something the wrong way but i didn't bug me Im not sure if ill be back But maybe ill give it another shot	3	Red Robin Gourmet Burgers	3.5
I really like this place the food is good (except for the beef thought it was kinda dry) The service was good and it is fast and cheap Getting a lot of food for the price Have been here a few times already in the past few weeks This is going to be my spot	5	Makai Pacific Island Grill	4.5
This is by far my favorite teriyaki place ESPECIALLY THE BEEF PLATE!! The chicken is pretty good to They previously had a cashier that never smiled which is real let down And prevented me from going there more  cause it made me feel bad  But i think she is gone cause i haven't seen her in awhile The new one is smiling and make you feel a lot more welcomed If you like teriyaki places this is the one you have to try The beef is char grilled so it gives the extra flavor By the far the BEST IN TOWN! BLOWS teriyaki madness IMO!	5	Yogi's Teriyaki	4
I  tried this place cause i was reading the recently good reviews ? But i order delivery and the food was pretty fast Which is why they got 2 stars But other then that this food is absolutely terrible Im not sure where all these people have been eating chinese food before but this experience was awful!! I tried multiple dishes and every dish was so bland and absolutely no flavor at all ?? I dont know if they are cutting back on spices or ingredients ??  Will definitely not be back	2	Xo Chinese Food	3.5
I really like this place food was great and it was pretty cheap for lunch Service was prompt The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is one of the waitresses had a little bit of an attitude but i didn't let it ruin my experience Will definitely be back	4	Naka Sushi	4
"After travelling and not having Asian food for three days we decide to have some authetic Chinese food.  We know there is a Sam Woo in this neighborhood so we decide to check it out.  Of course it is more pricy than its counterpart in Los Angeles since a lot of ingrident had to be shipped from Los Angeles.
The service is alright.  They took our order and bring our food in a reasonable time.  Neither fast nor slow.  Typical chinatown service and decoration.  I came to eat not to look at the decor or talk to the waiter.  If you want to look, go to the casino located in the strip.  If you want to talk, talk to your travelling compansion or watch a comedy show.
We ordered:
Beef chow Fun.  Very tasty.
BBQ pork on steam rice.  Generous portion of pork.  Pork is a little bit on the salty side.
Shrimp Fried Rice.  Good wok Flavor but low in salt to bring up the taste.  Shrimp is small.
Seafood pan fried noodle.  Could use a little bit of soy sauce.
Overall, the food is Ok but not very delicious.  Service is OK.  Portion is not as generious as the Los Angeles counterpart and more pricy, however, this is located in the middle of a desert.  Everyone here charge more than Los Angeles."	3	Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant	2
"Seemed like a lot of stores clean and all inside didn't get to really walk through everything but there seemed to be some good sales.

"I love this place.

After the worst dining experience on the other side of Caesars at Michel Richard, my buddy and I sat down at the noodle counter and waited for it to open.

I watched my noodles get made, cooked and prepared by the master noodle maker (i'm sure there is a Chinese word for this) and had the best bowl of Pork, Mushrooms and Noodles.

I think my wife is still mad at me for not bringing her along.  Next time..."	5	Beijing Noodle No. 9	2.5
"Went there expecting something special.  NOPE
Eggs in A Hole... more like soaked in butter.
To add insult to injury...
Awful. Hair in my food. 'nuff said

15 minutes later when the so called manager came, some little girl with no presence, and I told her I wanted noodles from Beijing no 9, she thought I was kidding."	1	CENTRAL BY MICHEL RICHARD	3
Ordered the spicy ginger beef plate. Excellent. Perfectly seared and tender. Didn't have to wait long for a table. Service was good. Good portions.	5	Grand Lux Cafe	4
If your in a rush don't stop here I ordered peach cobbler and didn't have any peaches more like cinnamon water dumplings food was good ordered meatloaf Mac and cheese beans and rice but it wasn't great for the price I will rather go to Mario's	2	Angie's Soul Food Kitchen	4
"I seriously love this place. I love the staff and the food. I've been coming here since it first opened with my mom and I've became a regular. Phil and his wife are just amazing ! 
This is the type of place that when you and your friends don't know where to go , you come here. I know for a fact I've brought all my friends here , even visitors from out of state ! So if I could I'd give this 10 stars"	5	Tasty Crepes	4.5
Gordon. You need to do some QA on your fish. Was greasy and not real tasty. Not really sure what sort of fish it was either. Chips were pretty good. Coming from having the bar set pretty high eating fantastic fish and chips in Kailis Bros and Cicarello's at Fremantle in Western Australia we were left a bit disappointed. Staff were super friendly and nice. Love the packaging and the tartare sauce.	2	Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips	4
I thought this was a great tasting cheeseburger, with fresh tasting ingredients. Like other Yelpers have stated though, the price is a bit steep for what you get. I should not be hungry after eating a double cheeseburger. I was not very impressed with their fries which were the crinkle cut fries with what tasted like a cheap canned cheese sauce. No comparison to In N Out burger. If I came again i'd get the double cheeseburger again and the Shack-cago dog, which with tax would probably set you back $16...	3	Shake Shack	4
Saw the reviews on this place I wanted to give it a try before leaving Vegas. Came in here around 11am and there was no line. I went with the club sandwich, after almost going with the roast beef and horseradish sandwich. When the cashier rang us up, I thought, "wow, one place in Vegas that isn't trying to take all your money." Then I got my sandwich which was pretty small. Tasted good though. Also tried the tomato soup, also pretty good. Not the best sandwich I've ever had but I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again.	4	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"I had extremely high expectations for this place and was not disappointed after my visit. I like to think I have a decent understanding of Thai cuisine, and it's much more than just Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, and Pad Se Eww.

The menu here was beyond extensive. We went with the garlic prawns which were recommended to us. I thought they were delicious but I would have thought\/liked if they came with some kind of lime\/chile dipping sauce. Also had the Isaan sausage which was very good. The nam prik noon was awesome, though I would have liked to see more fried pork skins for dipping. The seabass over the papaya salad was also really good. The seabass was cooked to perfection. The papaya salad was a bit sweet for my liking but complemented the seabags nicely and tasted extremely fresh. Also tried the That iced tea, which I thought was good because it was not too sweet. 

If I had room for more I would have gone with the crispy duck panang and the pork stew.

Plenty of parking but this place fills up fast. The service was good."	5	Lotus of Siam	4
Awesome Pizza, but only in Vegas could you get away with prices like this. Maybe the best thin crust i've had, but I've never eaten at some of the legendary New York pizzeria's. The white pizza and the sausage\/pepperoni were both great. You probably couldn't go wrong with any of their pizza slices. It leaves you wanting more.	4	Secret Pizza	4
You know those small coffee makers inside mediocre hotel rooms that come with the cheap packaged coffee? Well that coffee is better than the coffee here. Not to mention it's super expensive. I also tried their pasta salad and their caprese mozzarella salad, bland and boring. Stick to whatever is in your hotel room...	1	Va Bene Caffè	3.5
"The food is just average. It's good but hardly memorable. I had the special ramen and Koi feels the need to put their twist by making it dry (without soup). I was a bit disappointed. But, the taste was good. So, I won't complain. 3*

The time that it takes for the food to get to the table though is seriously LONG. We waited for more than 25 minutes (after ordering). I also think it is overpriced. But, it's Vegas, where everything is expensive. 2*

The waiter is the primary entertainment. He's so goofy with funny comments here and there. Give him a raise seriously. Unfortunately, I can't remember his name. 4*

Noise level was nice until roughly 1030 but it's Vegas. So, I won't deduct points. Neutral."	3	Koi Restaurant	3.5
Worst experience ever!! Seriously never go here for Super Bowl.  Or ever. It is a poorly run restaurant. Trust me. Don't do it.	1	Tom's Urban	3.5
Always wanted to try. Not impressed. Their signature drink frozen hot drinks were somewhat a little disappointing. Too sweet, tasted like a slushy melted ice cream. We had the chicken and waffles for breakfast... Ummmm no!!! Chicken too dry, potato too dry and waffles just lack that umpf! Pricing was a little over priced for the food that you ca	2	Serendipity 3	3
"Worst experience at this hotel. Staff is friendly enough, but incompetent. After I checked in on Friday, I informed bell desk how good their dry cleaning service is because I have a very expensive sweater and I don't trust many places cleaning it.

The staff informed me it will be in good hands and great care will be taken care of it. After mailing it over for about 10-15 minutes, I decide to go ahead and trust these guys with my item. (Surely a hotel of this stature is on top of things like this). 

The employees give me a confusing piece of paper to fill out, and after 10 hours of traveling to get to Vegas I wasn't thinking clearly and checked off my sweater under ""laundry"". 

I get my sweater back two days later, and find out it is two sizes too small and fuzzy. My $1000 sweater is now unwearable. 

I confront the bell desk, and the manager informs me that they do not know what happened because the MGM does not dry clean their clothes, they send everything to a separate company to handle it. (Never was explained this before). 

I explained to manager how my sweater was clearly not dry cleaned but washed in a harsh cycle and it is ruined. Upon further inspection of my receipt, the manager points out that I had checked my sweater off under ""laundry"" tab. I explain to manager that their paperwork is BS and I specially asked for dry cleaning not laundry and how did their 2 employees assisting me not catch my mistake or volunteer to fill out the form. The answer was, ""well I'm sorry about that, would you like me to send it to out to get it washed again and maybe stretched"" 

Thank you MGM for costing me $1000 and not being transparent. I will be filing a civil lawsuit."	1	MGM Grand Hotel	3
"Actually I would like to try this restaurant but since they opened their ticker which faces Russell Road has a word spelled wrong.  Instead of saying Open, after it says Blue Plate Specials it says NPDN.  I have called about it but it is still not changed.

My sense of order says their food may be great but I cannot enter the building until the sign is changed."	3	Hometown Eats	4
"This was simply the best Thai restaurant I've had thus far.  Many have said this was the Best Thai in the continental USA and I think they're right!  I was in Vegas for a week and we visited this place 3 times.  Loved it.

All my favorite dishes were found under the Chef Choices section of their menu.  My top favorite dish was the deep-fried prawns with shell with pepper in special garlic sauce.  We tried both versions of the deep-fried prawns but garlic was hands-down easily the best (the other was just okay).  

We also ordered a Whole 2-pound CharGrilled Catfish in our 2nd visit.  It was yummy but we agreed we wouldn't order this version again.  First, it takes 45 mins. to prepare (which we were told, of course).  Second, the catfish skin was a bit too well-done (burnt) for our tastes (and we like BBQ).  The cooked catfish meat was very good and it was worth trying.  We'll probably try another cooked version of  whole catfish next time we're here, visiting Vegas.

I also recommend the Chilean Sea Bass, the Crab Fried Rice and their Drunken Noodle with whatever [insert meat of preference].  

The Chilean Sea Bass was also excellent but I've had equally good sea bass for less in price.  Not a super value dish but the quality was excellent.  The crab fried rice was also excellent.   We had crispy duck w\/ drunken noodle and it was good, not spectacular (since being asian, I've had quite a lot of duck).  

Choose the spice level of your food to suit your preference.  I don't tend to go too spicy and since I have a fairly low spicy tolerance level, we usually choose Level 2.  We tried Level 4 and it was too hot for me halfway into the second serving.  For those who like it spicy, just ignore my warning and go for whatever rocks your socks!  
Enjoy!"	5	Lotus of Siam	4
This place is in a great spot in the Arts District.  Food is quick, fresh and delish!  They even have great Pho-meat options which my husband loved.  Kid-friendly and spacious too.	5	Tacos Huevos	5
This place is legit.  Just like Pizzeria Regina.  Former owner from the North End.  The sports memorabilia will make you smile and so will the pizza.  Super friendly.  Worth the trip up from Summerlin.  I won't go elsewhere for pizza any more.	5	North End Pizza	3
A clear disappointment.  Caesar salad was not even a real Caesar and came with a dressing packet on the plate.  Bloody Mary was $10 and too spicy, and their cheese fries with truffle oil?  A farce.  Bummed I spent my money here and didn't look on Yelp first.	2	Burke in the Box	2
"The meat jun is the best in town. 
I especially like the meat Jun sauce and the Kim Chi. Russell is a very gracious server and gives generous  food portions. I only wish they would open more  locations here in town."	5	Island Style Restaurant	4.5
I looked forward to eating at this place for two years, after seeing it on TV. It was good, but doesn't hold a candle to my regular spots in Texas. To be fair I didn't try every spice and flavor level.  I was really disappointed that they didn't have blue crabs when we were there.  Shrimp were good and the crawfish were overpriced, but that may just be Vegas.  All in all, I'm glad I can say I finally went, but probably will not return.	3	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
My dad says this was the best Thai food he has ever had. Personally I've had better but this place was good. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. My dad is a vegan and he wanted to order the tofu pad see ew which turned out to be pretty good. Red curry with chicken was good as well. All of the different meats we had were very tender. Yelp check in offer was a free Thai iced tea which was as expected. Place is small (14 seats) but very clean.	5	Thai Pan Cuisine	4.5
ABSOLUTELY LOVE the service and selection here! My daughter and I got nachos to share and still had leftovers! Portions are really big and definitely worth the money.	5	Serendipity 3	3
Nice selection. Only four stars because it was kinda hard to find a clean table. They may have been short staffed or had new people working the dining room. But once we got settled to our table everything was good! The soups were good, but a little on the salty side (veggie beef one) however the clam chowder was awesome!! Very nice selection of salads. I love to try their creations. A go to place when you're feeling like you need to eat your veggies!!	4	Sweet Tomatoes	3.5
Came here for a vegan afternoon snack and had the veggie lettuce wraps and veggie sushi. Wrap (4pcs) was better than the sushi (6pcs). Good value - $17 for both after tax.	4	Ondori Asian Kitchen	4

We ordered some kind of Mexican dish that comes with tortillas, and asked waitress for the corn tortillas,  because I'm gluten free, and we got flour tortilla inside, we asked again and second time they brought us flour tortilla, after we spoke with manager she proposed us to get extra muffin. Seems like she doesn't know what gluten free means	1	Egg & I	4.5
Ordered the chao bo and it was so bland.  No flavor.  The bread cost another $2 and was old and stale.  Worst chao ever and over priced! !! $13 + Not to mention no vegetables came along with it.	2	Pho Kim Long	3.5
This was the best buffet I've been to! My fiancé and I went on a Saturday night and the check was about $90, it was a little pricey but worth simply for the crab legs!! I think we each had 3 plates full of crab legs and shrimp. It was also nice the crab legs were pre cracked so all you had to do was snap it open and pull easy to get the crab meat. We also really enjoyed the prime rib. The dessert table wasn't a huge hit with us but everything was worth from the crab legs, prime rib, and the great service we had. We will definitely be coming back!	5	The Buffet at ARIA	3
"Gordon Ramsay's Steak was the HIGHLIGHT of my Vegas vacation. The shows, clubs, and casinos are great, but dining here is what stood out the most!

I tried to make reservations online and it told me that all the time slots I selected were unavailable! I REFUSED to give up and just called directly. I ended up getting a 6:45pm reservation which is perfect! Word to the wise it's a 25$ fee for EACH person if you don't make your reservation!

We were seated upstairs in a dimly lit room, with about 4 large tables. I guess these rooms are reserved for large parties as we had a group of 7. Our service was IMPECCABLE! Drinks were ordered on an ipad, bread was presented to us, and our orders were in quickly! Everyone was looking forward to dining here so we already knew what we wanted. UNTIL our server brought out the different cuts of steak!

I stuck to my guns and ordered the 22oz rib-eye! Mother of GAWD was that an excellent choice! I enjoyed it far more than the wellington, which was delicious in its own right. I prefer to have a bit of fat on my steak! Adds additional flavor! The best part is the fat was nice and CRISPY! My mouth is beginning to salivate as I type this! I was given a hard time for ordering a well done steak but who cares! I don't like my food bleeding all over the plate lol... The steak was juicy and PACKED with flavor! MY GOODNESS! THE best steak I ever had!

The sides were pretty damn good as well. We ordered asparagus, mac n cheese, loaded potatoes, and a potato puree! The sides are definitely family sized and we shared amongst each other. The mac n cheese was the most memorable to me. Absolutely delicious!

Dinner was worth every dime of the $600+ tab! I don't even remember the exact amount. I just handed over some cash haha! Special thanks to the hardworking staff who made our dinner phenomenal!!! I will DEFINITELY be returning the next time I'm in Vegas!

P.S.
You don't need ANY steak sauce! My sister ordered the house made steak sauce and it overpowered the deliciousness of my steak! She thoroughly enjoyed but to each is own! That's not to say it was bad but it tasted like bbq sauce to me."	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
"Came for happy hour after wondering around for a while. Very nice restaurant! Love when you can see into the kitchen and the wine rack is HUGE!
We started off with red and white sangria. Both were VERY tasty! I couldn't resist and ordered 2!

For food we ordered lobster mac & cheese, bbq shrimp, popcorn shrimp, a andouille link platter, and Emeril's gumbo! 
The dish that stood out the most was most definitely the lobster mac! My, my, my!!!! We were supposed to be sharing it but I couldn't resist hogging it like my own lol! Full of lobster chunks and delicious cheesy penne noodles! Crazy thing is I didn't even order it lol! I ordered the least favorable dish, the gumbo! I was kinda surprised it wasn't better but it wasn't bad either. I expected a bit more flavor and maybe a little kick in the spice department.

The popcorn shrimp were actually a good size. Crispy, fried shrimp, served with a delicious mustard! There was more than enough to share amongst 3 people but I ended up scarfing that down as well lol! 
The bbq shrimp were tasty but not knock your socks off amazing. They were 3 large battered shrimp in a semi sweet bbq sauce.

The andouille platter surprised me! Im not a huge fan of sausage on its own but this was delicious! It was accompanied by a creole mustard, bread, and SUPER tangy\/sweet pickles. Definitely worth $9 to try!

The appetizer portions are worth the money, drinks are delicious, and service was great! I can't wait to return to Vegas!"	4	Table 10	3.5
"Everything that needs to be said has been said so I wont be long...

24hours-check...
Expensive-check...
Milkshakes-check...
Steak fries-check...

Burgers- AVERAGE!

My cousin came here during the Mayweather-Alvarez fight and was raving about it. He told us it was a must try! Well as soon as we landed we drove here. Jet lag wouldn't allow our growling stomachs to settle for anything but a FAT burger! 
I left full but underwhelmed! On top of that we shelled out over $30 for a few burgers, drinks, and fries! Sheesh! It's not bad just not the best burger I've had or anything..."	2	Fatburger	3.5
"I actually visited Grand Lux twice on my 5 day vacation in Vegas. One time with a large group and once after a night of clubbing! Both experiences were pretty good!

Everyone is spot on with the Cheesecake comparison. If you've been there it's pretty much the same here. Inexpensive, large plates, and plenty of items to choose from. 
The first night I ordered the ""Shaking Beef"" and my late night meal was chicken & waffles. 
The shaking beef was pretty good. Nice chunks of beef, red onions, green onions, and white rice. Definitely liked the kick it had to it.
The chicken and waffles were ok. Nothing spectacular but it fulfilled my late night craving!

Next time I club it up at TAO or Lavo I will definitely return. I don't know if I would consider it a ""go to"" spot for me but it's cool. If you're on a budget this is a great place to dine because there are MANY options under 20$ Not bad for Las Vegas!"	4	Grand Lux Cafe	4
Yum yum yum! So healthy. The owner is so nice and accommodating. I love coming here. Everytime I eat here I feel good.	5	To See Roll	4.5
"Craftsteak was really a great Steak House experience. I came here with 4 of my boys for our big dinner out during a bachelor party weekend. (There are plenty of other reviews covering our Shenanigans)

At any rate they won me over from the start because they carry Hudson River Whiskeys' line of fine whiskeys including, the Baby Bourbon. That immediately got the night off to a great start! 

I started off with the Lobster Bisque which was excellent! One of the best I've had with a generous serving of Lobster. The bisque was prepared excellently. Then I got right down to business with my 20 oz Bone-In Ribeye with Blue Cheese. I ordred it medium-rare and it also was prepared excellently. The side dishes were excellent too; sauteed spinach, mushroom assortment, and ground grits with bacon. I paired my main course with a nice Willamette Pinot Noir.

All in all, it was a great steak. I wasn't sure it was the best steak I've ever had, but with the amount of steak houses I've been to I'm not sure I can really tell anymore. The service definitely puts on par if not apart with the big boys like Morton's and Capital Grille. I throughly pleased and unlike the Big 4, it's not everywhere!

It was a great dining experience, if you're in Vegas definitely check it out."	4	Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak	4
"Can't say enough about Javier's - would give it a 4.75 if possible. Only drawback was the level of noise and - maybe - the lighting. The server - absolutely tremendous - had a flashlight at the ready so we could read the menus.

Food was excellent; everyone at our table ordered the Carnitas and all all raved about it. Will return next time in Vegas - no questions!"	4	Javier's	4
Enjoyed the food ; ordered tuna melt and Hawaiian BBQ sandwiches - pricing was good. A bit slow to get service, but staff was friendly and helpful. Would eat there again - may try the breakfast menu next time.	4	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"Great food - awesome selection of ingredients - and superb service. Ate here twice on consecutive days - my best breakfast experience in Las Vegas!

Highly recommend it!"	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
Food was good - had Hong Kong Noodles - a portions were appropriate; not oversized as many other restaurants. Server was lukewarm; once we declined on cocktails, he seemed to tune out. Atmosphere was somber, quiet but a bit weird for a Las Vegas restaurant.	3	Rice & Company	3
"We tried this All You Can Eat sushi bar based on other Yelp reviews while visiting Las Vegas, and we were not disappointed!  It is located off the strip, so easy to get to with plenty of parking spaces.  We sat at the sushi bar and immediately we were greeted and served drinks, which we greatly appreciated after a long day.

The sushi and rolls we ordered were very good.  We love Uni and were pleasantly surprised that it was part of the AYCE menu, and very fresh!  The Sake and Hamachi were also excellent.  Service was prompt and friendly.  If there was any negative, for us, the music was just too loud for a quiet afternoon sushi feast.  Higly recommend!"	4	Sushi 21	4
Ryan and Kimberly took really good care of us!!!! Ryan was very friendly, handsome and accommodating!!!! He had a lot of patience with us and treated us very nice. I highly recommend Nacho Daddy and the Scorpion Shots!!!!!!	5	Nacho Daddy	4
Raising Canes is one of the only fast food restaurants I'd go to when I need something cheap and quick on the way versus your usual McDonalds, Burger King, Jack In The Box, etc. The chicken there is never frozen and your order is cooked upon ordering. Their famous Cane's Sauce is made from scratch at the store and it's always perfectly consistent. For an average female, I always order the 3 Finger Combo (3 chicken fingers, a Texas toast, fries and a drink) and it's just enough to fill me up. I'm completely addicted to their sweet tea. It's a must get whenever I come here, not too sweet and no bitter or after taste. Their Texas toast is bomb! Order it butter both sides if you like it more crispy! They also have honey mustard which I occasionally replace the Cane's sauce with since I love that as well. The only downside is that their chicken fingers are a hit or miss, juicy or dry. The drive thru is usually packed and wait times can be long especially during peak times.	3	Raising Cane's	4
"First Impression: Hobak is located where it used to be literally a plaza with a whole row of non-occupied, connected plain buildings. Now, you cannot miss this spot driving down Spring Mountain with its little patio and red\/white striped awning. The inside is amazing, super unique. You are eating inside but the interior design makes you feel like you are eating outside at a modern Korean marketplace with other seating sections that act as a little shop. Their soda cooler is the 'telephone booth.' Okay, you just have to see this HIP-ness for yourself! The restaurant was less than half full but we still had to wait 10 minutes to get seated for lunch. 

Food: FYI, this is not a AYCE. Once we were seated, our table was already set up with all the banchans (7 total) along with our dipping sauces waiting for us to eat away! The banchans were all delicious which is usually rare. My boyfriend and I ordered the Hobak Beef Combo for 2 - $54.99 (Angus Brisket, Angus Ribeye, Hobak Marinated Skirt Steak) with bean paste stew, steamed egg, vegetables and cheddar sauce which was a plenty and enough for dessert in the end! Great food presentation and the meat is definitely great quality compared to all the other KBBQ places in town. I highly recommend the skirt steak as its juicy and full of flavor. The melted cheddar sauce dipped with the meat is to die for. Dessert is included in the combo and you can choose rice pop with vanilla or green tea ice cream. It's similar to an ice cream sandwich with ice cream and a layer of red bean in between rice pops (fluffy cracker like). It's a very interesting taste, nothing I've had before, yet it blends so well together. 

Service: Our server was very attentive. They cook all your meat for you which is a plus so you can just enjoy eating. They always come back to cook your next type of meat once they see you've emptied the grill so no awkward wait times deciding if you should cook yourself. They pull their vents downward closer to the grill when cooking so you don't need to worry about being congested in smoke. 

The Hobak hype is real! Easily the next favorite KBBQ spot in town. Even though it's not AYCE, the quality you get is worth it. I am a happy returning customer :)"	5	Hobak Korean BBQ	4.5
"I am a boba fanatic. When I hear about a new boba place in town, I HAVE to try it out and Mr. Z just recently opened so I had to give them a visit. It's located inside the Cathay Plaza at Chinatown which surprised me because that plaza has been pretty dead for years already. When I entered, there was not a single customer inside and the workers seemed very bored, no energy. The place is simple and clean. There's only a small bar area with chairs on the left side to sit and other than that, there's no tables when there's a lot of empty spaces which isn't an ideal place to really hangout at. Their only trashcan is this large Sesame Street trashcan where you need to lift the lid in order to dispose your trash which I wouldn't want to touch. I do really like the huge zebra mural on the wall though. 

Upon ordering, the workers seem like this is either their first job or they had no training at all. They didn't really have knowledge of the drinks or know how to use the register. I came here two times to give a second try and they always needed someone else to help them out. I understand this is a new business but the communication is pretty awkward. 

I wasn't sure what to try so I decided to order something I don't normally get. I got their Red Bean Slushie with Boba since it was a Mr. Z favorite. I was the only customer there and it took way longer than needed to make my drink. However, I did fall in love with this drink! It wasn't too sweet or too bland. They put real red beans on top and the drink is just savory. The boba can be improved as its more toward the mushy side than the chewy, firm that I prefer. I also like how their Amazon Slushie has blended boba which is a great option for those who can't stand the chewing\/full texture of boba. The second time I came here, my coworkers ordered the Mr. Z Boba Milk Tea which taste like any other milk teas but also a watered down version. 

They offer a stamp card and are currently offering BOGO 50%.

I think I'll come back when I crave for the Red Bean Slushie because it is really good. Not sure if I want to try other drinks though."	3	Mr. Z Tea Co	4.5
"First Impression: I've been waiting for this place to open after driving by its fancy exterior signage many times. With all the KBBQ restaurants in town, this one definitely stole the spotlight. I finally got the chance to try this place and upon entering, I was fascinated by their interior design from the layout to the decorations of sculptures, mirrored vents, high ceiling and etc. My friend and I came here for dinner around 7pm and there were a plenty of seating available. We had the option of sitting at a booth OR, the traditional Korean seating where you take off your shoes and sit on these large blue pillows. Of course we went with the traditional way to get the full experience!

Food: We weren't super hungry so we decided to order a la carte but they do have party platters recommended for the size of your group. We ordered the prime rib eye, beef tongue (x3) and thinly sliced brisket (x2). They serve 14 banchans (side dishes) naming each one as its being served and barley tea instead of water that is light with a hint of roasty flavor. I would drink this over water any day because it's so refreshing! Your dipping choices are green tea salt (my favorite out of the 3 and super delicious paired with meat), regular salt with pepper and a dark sauce. Some of the meat is served on a black slate which adds a unique touch. The meat portion is quite small and the price is on the pricier side but seeing the quality, color and cut of the meat is definitely worth it!

Service: Everyone was super friendly and attentive. The servers were patient and cook for you all the way through for each meat which was nice. Sometimes I just prefer to cook it myself so I can eat and chat since having them cook in between us gets kind of awkward. One thing to point out is that they don't serve us individual plates. After the meat was cooked, they move it to the side of the grill and we had no plates to hold the meat except eating off of the grill. There was also no napkins to be found. We were always checked up on except it gradually slowed when the dining area got busier which was understandable. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience here at Goong. It is a nice place to take friends and family to for the finer dining KBBQ experience than the typical places around Chinatown. I will come back and order the party platters next time to try out all the different kinds of meat they offer!"	5	Goong Korean BBQ Restaurant	4.5
"I've been dying to try this place out hearing so many people talk about it. After fasting for a night for an ultrasound, I was so excited to try out Fruits and Roots for my first time and first meal since it was such a close proximity. When I first walked in, it was about 7:35am in the morning, no one greeted me. The girl at the cashier looked at me then went back doing whatever she was doing. The 3 employees working at the time looked either tired, hated their job or unhappy. Another girl took my order and telling her it was my first time here, I wanted to try their fruit bowls. She told me that they have either acai bowl or pitaya bowl so I said ""I'll take the pitaya bowl."" Then she was like, ""That's an island bowl."" Okay my bad? Maybe I'm being sensitive but if they had a better attitude I wouldn't feel that way. She made my 'Island Bowl' as well and when it was finished she just handed it to me and turned around, walked away. 

The bowl was pretty but the taste was whatever. I do feel healthy eating it though. The pitaya tasted bland and the fruits didn't look that fresh. The bananas had some brown and the strawberries were dull. Thinking the toppings were just on top, I tried to finish it so I can get to the rest of the pitaya on the bottom. However, the entire bowl was filled with granola bites making it so dry. I might come back and try their juices out.. but they were all bottled up pre made before so it's not freshly blended juice that I prefer.

UPDATE: I did come back to give this place a second try. The experience and quality was better than the last."	2	Fruits and Roots	4.5
My friend wanted to come here for KBBQ during dinner time around 6pm. We had a party of 4 and were seated quickly but received no service. No menus or water were served to us. The restaurant wasn't busy either and most of the workers were just standing there. What was ridiculous was that a Korean party came in a little after us and were seated next to us and they were served menus, water and the servers also took their order while we sat there for 15 minutes being ignored before we decided to walk out. And before all of that, they switched us to a smaller table because they felt that the original table they chose for us was too big. Workers are rude also. NBD. 3 new KBBQ just opened in town. I'm never coming back.	1	Lee's Korean BBQ	3.5
"I came upon Cafe Zupas when I was searching for a healthy place to eat. I can't believe I didn't know about this place earlier. They offer a great variety of salads, soups and sandwiches. Order in large or half orders OR try their 2 combo for only $8.79 and pick any two of your choice. The meal also comes with a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. The portion is just enough to fill you up. Don't be shy to ask for extra or other ingredients (for a little extra cost of course). The process is like a cafeteria style where you order what you like and as you go down the line, you can add soup and there's also a sweets\/dessert case with assorted creme brulee, cakes and bars. There are a plenty of staff so you get super quick service and wait time is never a problem. I always get to-go during lunch time and I'm never there longer than 5 minutes. Everyone is super friendly and patient to help you with any questions. All their ingredients are fresh and everything is made from scratch each day. Their cleanliness is also a plus. 

I'm addicted to their Strawberry Harvest Salad! I've never been a salad girl but after trying this, I'm HOOKED. It's more of a sweet salad though which I don't mind. It has sliced chicken breast, strawberries, dried cranberries, sliced apples, pecans, and fontina cheese along with their unique Strawberry Champagne Vinaigrette. Everything complements each other so well it's amazing how great a salad can taste. I like to add oranges to it as well. I have to eat this at least once a week on my lunch break. I always tell myself to try something new on the menu but I can't seem to drift away from my Strawberry Harvest!"	5	Cafe Zupas	3.5
The five stars don't lie! So glad to have Brew Tea here in the southwest, no more driving down to Chinatown for boba. The number one thing that separates them from other boba shops is their excellent customer service. Everyone is greeted upon entering and they remember your face and your favorite drinks. Their honey boba is amazing, super chewy and bouncy. This is a place you would want to try everything on their menu. One of my favorite drinks and a must try is their Hokkaido Milk Tea. It has a rich and creamy taste of condensed milk and a hint of caramel flavored candy. The texture is silky smooth as you savor each sip. They specialize in freshly brewed tea so you can never go wrong with any selection off of their menu. A super light and refreshing tea I love is the Chrysanthemum iced tea perfect for the summer. My boyfriend's favorite are the Hokkaido also, Almond and Taro milk tea. Shout out to SOU, DENNIS and LOUIS!	5	Brew Tea Bar	5
Awful service. I sat there for thirty minutes without even being acknowledged or brought silverware. One waitress ran from POS to POS while the other followed completely flustered. People had to chase them down to pay the check. Can't review the food cause I barely even got a menu.	1	Burke in the Box	2
"Good food decent price! But for some reason French fries isn't that good while the French onion soup is at room temperature and wasn't hot enough.

Go for the steak, it's very tender n juicy but the season isn't as impressive. For the price that you are expecting to pay, this supposedly is affordable French food!"	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
The experience eating here is not pleasant, the person took us to the table I told her we want to chained table, she refused. There only 3 kinds of sushi served, with the price we paid I expected more. The Chinese food was salty, the noodle soup wasn't good. The fruit only watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapple and melon, nothing special. The waiter served slow, need to asked to filled up the water. I will never go back!	1	The Buffet at ARIA	3
Hidden in a strip mall, this Korean restaurant exceeded expectations.  We've been there a few times now and it's always consistently good.  The Dolsat Bibimbap and BBQ Kalbi are both really good. It's definitely better than any of the Korean restaurants we've been to back home in San Francisco!	4	Soyo Korean Barstaurant	4
I have to say I was pretty disappointed given the number of reviews for this place.  My wife had the veal chop and I had the lamb chops.  We also ordered a side of mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.  I can't say it was anything special and I've definitely had better on all fronts.  My main issue is that I'm a big fan of lamb but the citrus sauce that they used pretty much killed all the gamey flavor.  I guess that's fine for people who don't want a gamey taste but then they probably shouldn't be ordering lamb anyways.  For the price, I would definitely recommend going elsewhere.	2	Mesa Grill	4

My friend and I made reservations to this restaurant for our second night in Vegas. We are both big fans of thai food and I must say that this restaurant did not disappoint. I ordered the iced pomegranate green tea which was unsweetened but I probably could've guessed that prior to ordering. I got the Pad Kee Maow which is the flat noodles which came with egg, onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, basil, and chili. I chose a 3 as a spice level out of 5 (5 being the spiciest). I love flat noodles and this dish was awesome. I would definitely come back and order the same thing again. The atmosphere was great. The restaurant's seating area is sort of divided into 5 sections and some sections more private and others to serve larger groups. I love this place and would definitely recommend it.	5	SEA: The Thai Experience	3.5
I loved this place and expected nothing less as it is Gordon Ramsey's place. I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was amazing with the avocado, asadero cheese, jalapeño and roasted tomato. I had the sweet potato fries which were amazing my fried got the Parmesan truffle which we just as good. I went with the Oreo milkshake as suggested by the waiter and it was delicious but I didn't like that half was pudding since I'm not a fan of pudding. Nonetheless my experience here was great and I'd definitely go again!	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
My friend and I visited the Wicked Spoon while in Vegas and I thought it was pretty good. I loved how they had small salads and dishes in small personal plates. There wasn't as much of a variety as I would've liked. There was a breakfast bar, salad bar, a bar with a few meats, sushi bar, and dessert bar. I must say that the fresh made carrot, orange, mango juice was awesome. I also enjoyed some of the small desserts that they had at the dessert bar. I would probably go again.	3	Wicked Spoon	3.5
Food was better than expected, workers were very helpful since this was my first time going. I had the Chicken shwarma plate, I got extra hummus on the side which was a dollar and change more, no big deal.  Will definitely go back time and time again.	4	Parsley Modern Mediterranean	4
Well I went to the bar area only, on a Tuesday night.  It's a great place to go hang out after work and just relax.  Great HH specials and service is great.

"Since I'm new to Vegas checking out local areas is on the top of the list.  Met up with a few co-workers for Monday night Trivia that starts at 7pm.  I think they have happy hour from 4-7 with 2.50 drink specials and extended past 7 for those playing Trivia.  The host is pretty good and interactive with the crowd.  Like most MC's you feed off the vibe of the crowd.  They have top three prizes and categories that range from history, tv shows, movies, casino chips and everything in between.  Plan to be there on Monday's going forward.  
I didn't try the food this past Monday so I can't tell you anything about it.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  
The place looked good for small groups or large crowds.  Crowd ranged from young 20's to mid 40's from what I saw on Monday.  People coming straight from work to people dressed in sweats that came straight from the gym.  Nice local place to hangout."	5	Putter's Bar & Grill	3.5

"Okay so we went here by accident.  This is definitely not the typical take out chinese food it is more authentic.  We ordered the combination spicy meat appetizer and lets just say I personally will not be ordering that again.  The texture, the name of the appetizer and the taste was not at all appealing.  For the meal portion we ordered the hot & spicy chicken it was very good, however you will have to order rice or noodles with the chicken otherwise it comes alone.  We also ordered the combination lo mein with the extra wide noodles.  This was really good we ordered a side of hot sauce and that added a bit more of a kick to the whole plate.  
The service was okay, we did run out of water and never was refilled or asked us if we needed refills at anytime we were there."	3	China Mama Restaurant	3.5
Stayed at TI for NYE and Kahunaville is where we had dinner and drinks.  It was pretty early in the night so it was still restaurant\/bar style.  Not to loud, array of music playing and the bartender was very crazy busy but attentive.  The food was good, there is a decent choice of food to choose from.  The drinks are fantastic!  Made well and different types of drinks for liking.  We then went to get ready and came back down around 1000-1030 or so.  The place at that point had a DJ and a small dance floor.  The music was great, the age group ranged from mid 20s and up.  Bartenders were doing some kind of show with making drinks, pouring shots into the crowds mouth at the bar. Overall, I do recommend the place.  Depending on your timing you will either enter a bar\/restaurant scene or bar\/dance scene.	5	Kahunaville Island Restaurant	3

"We went in there to grab some Slush drinks w\/ Boba and coffee jelly.  My sister got the cappacino slush with coffee jelly highly recommend it.  I got the Mango slush with boba the mango was delish however I do think they added to extra (some kind of sweetner) so it made both drinks extremely sweet.  So I have definitey had better but it's not a bad place.  
The restaurant in itself was nice, decent size, seems like a great place to just hang out with  a small group or with a date etc....
They do offer food but we did not try any of the food tehre."	2	Icy Juicy	3
"Went there for dinner on a weekday.   The restaurant had 2 seperate couples having dinner so it was pretty quiet.  The food was pretty good.  The spice level ranges from not spicy, medium, very spicy.  We ordered very spicy and personally I did not think it was very spicy, it still seemed a bit bland.  The chicken biryani is what we had and it was decent.  In terms of the prices and the amount of food you are served it does not compare.  We also had the Badam Lassi (mango smoothie w\/ almond) the mango was VERY SOUR!!    
I will\/may go back only because it is very close and the food was decent."	2	Mantra Masala	3.5
Completely a fan of the southern yet hip menu. You can go all out but if you need to keep calorie check in count thats available too. Sparkling rose along with my kale salad with shrimp was a perfect vacation lunch. My husband said I hope that rose was good and YES the response was worth every penny. The atmosphere is super cool. The bar, the tables the lounging areas where we dined gave us a no wait for table situation which was need since my date had to return to class. LOVE IT. :) The chicken watermelon waffle dish looked to die for. I'm having that when I go back when holiday pounds are not around the corner.	4	Yardbird Southern Table & Bar	4.5
Looks good great atmosphere & great service. However our food was enough to where we were not hungry which is normally perfect for me. I don't like waste and oversized portions. I had the steak cauliflower it was decent flavor and I kept my calorie count in check but seriously there was nothing but mashed up gooey looking tomatoes served with it. No sides whatsoever to compliment the dish. The spice chicken my husband had was flavorful but he ate every morsel and also had nothing but tomatoes on the side which he does not like and didn't know they were part of the dish. So basically we are saying we felt like suckers for choosing Searsucker :( wine list and prices not fair definitely overpriced and I'm not referring to overpriced as expected.	2	Searsucker	4
Every time I crave for Poke, I always make my way to Poke Heaven. Why? It's cause of their delish food. Mouthwatering sauces makes this joint a great place to experience poke at a different level. I definitely recommend this place...	5	Poke Heaven	4.5
1 star is only for a decent shake.  The burgers that were served to our group of six people were burned to a crisp.  There was literally a hard burned shell around the burgers, including a standard burger, 2 black bean veggie burgers, and 2 orders of sliders.  The waiter literally admitted that the sliders are always either "burned or raw" since they are "only 2 ounces each."  We were in a big rush to get to the airport so couldn't spend time to speak with the manager.  Many of us ended up leaving our food almost entirely uneaten.  Stay far away from this restaurant.  I have no idea how they can call themselves a burger joint.	1	I Love Burgers	3
I've been here twice once for dinner and once for lunch let me stress the fact that dinner time is a lot better than lunchtime food wise the meats come by pretty quick very good flavors and good service buffet options are pretty OK I'm giving three stars because I got rotten lemons or really bad lemons with my water other than that they're OK different experience if you've never had this Brazilian BBQ try it out decide for yourself mixed reviews on Yelp food is pretry good though.	3	Pampas Churrascaria Brazilian Grille	3
Omg this Donut shop is amazing. You cannot miss this place. I was nervous at first because the place only takes cash. But after trying there Regular donuts (Cake and Crueler) I wish I had more cash on me because I would have purchased more. This place blows PinkBox donuts away. You gotta make the trip down to Chinatown for this amazing donut.	5	Ronald's Donuts	4.5

"This is a very good Szechuan restaurant. The food isn't just spicy, it has a lot of flavor. The flavors are well blended for a mouth full of wonderfully blended ingredients where they compliment each other. I would definitely recommend this place as a must see for yourself when you come to Las Vegas. 

Well worth leaving the strip for this hidden treasure."	5	J & J Szechuan Cuisine川味坊	3
The food was great but the service was phenomenal.  Guy was a great "front man" recommending delicious drinks and burger choices. Kurtis and Rick brought the performance with their renditions on Happy Birthday to my friend Katy. Guy was clearly envious of the manager's jaw line and lush beard but he was able to work through that for the sake of good service. We will be back for sure.	5	Gordon Ramsay Burger	4
Service was attentive. The restaurant's located near a food court of the Venetian but the decor is nice, with an intimate setting inside. The pasta Casanova was great, but I recommend the Carbonara sauce - it's on point. It is a reasonably priced restaurant too, especially for an Italian restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip. The hostess recommends reservations for night time dining, but we went around 3pm and we didn't have to wait; there were plenty of table s available. Overall decent place for a decent Italian meal.	4	Casanova	3.5
"It was our last stop before heading home in Vegas. Someone in our group was craving shrimp, so I did what anyone would do...I opened the yelp app lol I found this place to be less than 10 minutes from the strip with a rating above 4.5 so we decided to give it a try. We had trouble finding it but it's located in the shopping center behind Autozone, tucked away in the corner. A real small hole in the wall type of restaurant.

We were greeted and served immediately upon coming in. The menu had something for everyone, including non-seafood eaters. The prices were not cheap, but it's Vegas. Back home, at 18 bucks a place you're at a decent sit down restaurant - definitely not a hole in the wall. 

Now the meal, absolutely delicious. We ordered the camarones aguachiles as an appetizer and they were spot on. I crave them just thinking about them. The molcajete was great, the pescado sarandeado was good, and the shrimp cocktail was delicious also. Basically, you can't go wrong ordering anything off the menu. 

Oh, and the horchata and jamaica drinks are home made! 

We will be coming back on every Vegas visit for sure!"	5	Mariscos Playa Escondida	4.5
The more I think about this buffet the more disappointed I am. For what you get this buffet is WAY OVERPRICED. There are much better buffets - quality and quantity - in Vegas. Why settle?	2	MGM Grand Buffet	2.5
This was my first time ever eating at Shake Shack and based on this experience I will definitely be back. I had a basic hamburger with bacon, cheese fries, and a soda and I wasn't disappointed. The food came out pipping hot and was full of flavor. It was well priced for the food I purchased which is a rarity on the Vegas strip. The place was packed while we were there, but the numerous employees I encountered were super friendly and didn't let the volume of people phase them. If you're looking for something fast, fun, and fulfilling while on the Strip I recommend Shake Shack.	4	Shake Shack	4
If we are craving Mexican food while we're in Vegas we usually make our way to Gonzalez Y Gonzalez. For a reasonable price you can arrive at the restaurant and leave content (full tummy). I often like to have their taco bowl and I'm yet to be disappointed. My other half likes their wet burritos. I don't usually have their alcoholic beverages because I like to get mine while playing the slots, but everyone who seems to order their margaritas etc. appears to love them.	4	Gonzalez Y Gonzalez Restaurant	3.5
I entered this buffet with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. For approx. $24.99 two of us were able to eat. (We used a MyVEGAS 2-for-1 coupon.) Three major pluses of this buffet were their sushi, California rolls, and fish. I could not get enough of either one. The location was very spacious allowing guests to easily spread out. The dessert menu was not as extensive as MGM's buffet, but if you're like me you don't go to buffets to only eat desserts. Thus far this is my favorite Vegas buffet and I look forward to coming back sometime in the future. Sorry for not having any pics at this location. I was too busy devouring the delicious food. :)	4	The Buffet at Monte Carlo	2.5
We had the 10-course dinner and very much enjoyed every course. The servers were very friendly and helpful as we selected from the several options for each course. They also warned us that nine of 10 people cannot finish all the courses, and they were right. But we finished most and took the rest back to the hotel to enjoy later. For so much good food, the price was quite reasonable ($29 each). We will put this on our dinner list again the next time we're in Vegas.	5	Sushi Takashi	4.5
"I tried the Bachanal buffet the day before during their early birds hours ( before 10 am ) and left at noon. So for the Bellagio, I did the same to have a good comparaison. So this is a review of weekend brunch before 11 am. I don t like the room of the buffet as it looks more of a cafeteria than a upscale buffet. I felt like I was in a food court. The light and the adjonction of the table does not give me a upscale or expensive feel to it. 
For the food, hands down I regretted not eating again at Bachanal. Everything tasted average to me. I did not go back for second on anything I tasted. Yes they have the crab legs though. The egg benedicts were not very appealing. The ham was really good as well as the home
Made sausages. They did not have any fresh juice compared to Bachanal. I did not find any originality in their food to be honest... I would have liked something different. This buffet is not for me."	3	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
"Romantic, quiet and great taste
After three days of buffet, this was the perfect place for a romantic dinner. After the mozzarella and tomato entree, we had the ravioli I with black truffle cream sauce which was really good. A little heavy but that is normal when you mix cream and truffle!
The service was good. The place had a romantic feel to it with low lighting and it was so much quieter than all the other places in MGM. Dessert was a chocolate pudding and that finished the experience in a high note."	4	Fiamma Italian Kitchen	4
One of my favorite buffet in Vegas. To me, a place to eat has to be structured in a way that you feel welcome, and the lighting has to be. Right enough for you to see the food and the cleanliness of the place. Wicked spoon had all of those and the service was excellent. The wait was about 1 hour in a Sunday around 11 am. It went fast to be honest as I was talking and meeting people in the line. The food: great choice of dishes. The stations were clearly displayed and the food was always warm and fresh. I loved the vertige assortments and the beet salad. The dessert station was really diverse. I would have liked more fruits diversity. They did not have watermelon. I tried the pasta dishes, meat station, salad bar etc.. it was really a great experience. I did the Bachanal and Bellagio and so far my fav two are the Bachanal and wicked spoon. It was different experiences and I loved both. Bachanal has fresh fruit juice which made it more appealing to me but I would definitely go back to Wicked Spoon!	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
Wow!! For a mom and pop off the main strip excellent. There was a 30 minute wait but well worth it. I asked for a cup of coffee while I waited and they were happy to bring it to me. Definitely a locals spot but highly recommend to skip the hotel breakfast and visit the gem. Fresh, tasty food with pleasant service. Very affordable. I will return.	5	Mr Mamas	4.5
Just okay. Was expecting more based on a friends  referral but the food was average and the service was slow and left me disappointed. $38 for a steak so I expected much more. The Brussel sprouts small plate was on point but overall would not return to this spot.	3	Tom's Urban	3.5
Excellent sushi at great prices! Was really happy with everything we tried. The staff were very friendly and the restaurant was very clean and new. We had the tuna nigiri and it was vey fresh. We also tried multiple rolls and hibachi lobster, it was delicious. This is the place to go for sushi! Plus your first beer is free!	5	Bonsai Japanese Steak & Sushi	4
"This is the only place where waiting 10-15 minutes for fast good is WORTH it!! 

I'd never heard of in n out till about 6 months ago and never understood why people where willing to wait so long for burger and fries. But after one visit I understood!"	5	In-N-Out Burger	4
I wish they were closer to where I live! The service was alright, we couldn't understand what one of the waiters was saying but he main guy was super nice. We waited for about 30 min for the food to arrive. I had the Lamb Korma and my husband had Lamb Vindoolo and we shared some traditional and Garlin Naan bread with a cup of Chai. The spice was perfect, my husband had the hot and I has medium. Hot enough for him and just a little kick for me..perfect =D I'd come back again in a heart beat.	4	Mount Everest India's Cuisine	4.5
We just happened to call them for carry out because we wanted Indian food and they were the closest one to us. I didn't know it was there first re-opening night and oh what a treat! My husband had the lamb vindaloo and I had the lamb korma  with both garlic and plain naan bread. The entire meal was amazing!! They were busy but the bartender --Britney-- was super nice and talked to me while i waited. We will be going back again, but this time to sit and dine.	4	Saffron Flavors of India	4
"We were on the far end of the strip since my daughter wanted to go there for the amusement games.  It was time for dinner and raining a little, so we decided to eat at the buffet.

The price was low.

We get seated and do the standard walk through to see what was available.  Wow this place looked just like a Country Buffet or Royal Fork.

Fried chicken was really salty and greasy.  Greasy meaning that it had more oil than the normal fried chicken. More than KFC.

The meat cutter at the beef station was really stingy and would only give me one, super thin slice.  I had to go back three more times to get enough to eat.

Did I say he price was low?

The other stuff was very uninspiring. The pasta dishes were mediocre at best.  Salad bar kind of sucked.

For the desserts they seemed like the pies were store bought.  The crusts on the pies were definitely not flakely, more mealy.

In regards to cleanliness, this place needs a good douche. It looks really weathered and needs to update the look to get it out of the '70s.

Did I say the price was low?  Well you get what you pay for.

I don't recommend you eat here unless you just want a large quantity of food for a low cost."	2	Circus Buffet	2
"I will not ever recommend this place to any friends.  Maybe a few enemies.

I'm not sure how anyone can rate this place higher than 3 stars.

I don't care if the place is in the Bellagio, the quality of the food and service are not at the level of the prices.

None of the food we had was any where near exceptional. 

Pho for $17 is triple of what you should pay.  There wasn't anything fantastic about it, the same bowl that I could get in a neighborhood Pho shop.  Plus we had to ask for sriracha and hoisin sauce.

The Singapore noodle dish really lacked curry flavor.  In the neighborhood restaurant I visit at home is packed with flavor and is $8 less.  Oh, I forgot I'm in the Bellagio.

Service was fair, but after our food arrived, there was almost no attention given.

Here's where the meal went really wrong.

One of the wait staff began clearing our table.  In her desire to get as many dishes off of our table as possible, she had way too many dishes in her hands.  She dropped one of the dishes on the floor and broke, with one of the pieces hitting me in the leg.  At first I thought, oh it hit me on the leg, no problem.  A few minutes later I felt liquid running down my leg, so I looked down and saw blood.

I used my napkin to wipe it off and then called the waitress that dropped the plate.  She looked at it and was going to wipe it with a towel that she was using to wipe the tables with.  I pulled my foot back and asked that she bring me a clean cloth and bandages.

She said she would tell the manager.  We waited for about 5 minutes and no manager came.

We found the manager ourselves and let her know what happened.  She said no one told her about the incident.  She had security come talk to us to make sure I didn't need paramedics. I told him I wanted to report this as an incident to make sure management had a record of it.  I never asked for anything other than to have an incident report made.

He told me that he would talk to the manager and have her adjust our bill.

What is really odd is most restaurants, when a customer is injured by the staff with blood, they will comp the entire bill.  She only took off half the amount and wasn't really apologetic.  Her attitude was more like I was an inconveniencing her and I should have moved my leg to avoid the dropping dish.

In summary, this place is way over price for mediocre food.  You can't blame the wait staff for poor service since they perform at the highest level of their manager.  And her low quality of service sets the bar really low for her team.

Oh yeah for the reviewers that said it had a great Asian ambiance, the decor reminded me of a casino cafe.  The only thing that made it seem like an Asian restaurant is the art work on the walls and the menu.

Stay away from this place!


This shows that they really have no care for the customer."	1	Noodles	3
"I gave Olives a 4 for the excellent food and wine.  

The atmosphere is really noisy which made it hard to have a conversation.

The waiter we had was competent, but tended to not know his stuff.

I ordered the steak with the green beans.  I usually focus on the steak, but with this meal, the green beans.  They prepare the green beans with an interesting tempura style.  The deep frying with the batter made the beans taste phenomenal.  Three of us at the table had the steak and green beans and all of us finished the green beans.

Oh yeah, the steak with the wine sauce was pretty good too."	4	Olives	4
"Normally I go to a to fill up on food after working out or not eating, basically looking for quantity and decent quality food.  I don't expect to have a 3 star Michelin experience a buffet or even a 1 star.

In Vegas most of the buffets are decent with the standard prime rib (which is probably ""choice"" and not ""prime"") and other favorites like crab and shrimp.  

This was the first time that I've been to Le Village Buffet and will probably make it a place to go when ever I'm in Vegas.

First off, the variety is top notch with a full array of a French menu.  

What really surprised me was the braised pork belly with apple and sweet potato.  It was juicy with just enough fat to really add flavor.  And by the way, exercise dieticians state that you need fat in your diet to provide energy for your work outs.  

Other things to try are the macaroni in a truffle cream sauce (probably ground truffles or truffle oil), crepes (both savory and sweet) and vegetable side dishes (which I usually avoid since you need to maximize your dollar value).

They had shrimp and crab legs, which I guess can be considered French cuisine, except it was just blanched and served cold. 

What was weird was the small section of sushi with a couple of trays of tekka maki and California role.  I guess they wanted to cater a little to the Japanese tourists.  But the ones I saw were eating everything but the sushi.

Now the important part...the desserts!  Creme brulee, flan, macaroons, crepes, frozen custard, bread pudding, fruit tarts and lots of cookies.  Yes, I tried them all.

I don't really like the macaroons, but I had to give them a try.  Still don't like them.

If you want to go to a Vegas buffet, go directly to Paris.  In my opinion its the best on the strip!"	4	Le Village Buffet	3
"I went to Le Village buffet on Sunday May 1st 2016, I arrived at the buffet shortly before closing time where I was made aware by the hostess that I would only have 45 minutes to eat. I find it to be extremely frustrating that they rushed me for my $31.99 buffet. I should have had an unlimited amount of time if not atleast an hour. How are you supposed to enjoy everything a buffet has to offer in 45 minutes? Ridiculous.

I quickly began getting as much food at the buffet to ensure that I could try everything there was to offer. I was extremely dismayed whenever I realized that the dinner rolls were not kept in warmers nor was their honey butter. The dinner rolls we're terrible quality I've had much better dinner rolls at Ryan's Buffet or Golden Coral Buffet which are both about $20 cheaper. 

Another item that I tried was the sirloin steak. The steaks were terrible quality, did not taste good at all and for a $30 buffet you couldn't even order a steak medium rare they were all well done. While chewing the steak I tried to gather what the taste reminded me of and I soon realized that it tasted like a hot dog. I was not pleased with the quality of steak nor was I pleased with the quality of prime rib. 

Whenever it got time for dessert I was really excited because I had been saving room to ensure that I would be able to try everything on the dessert section of the buffet. I love bread pudding and it is always one of my go-tos at buffets and the bread pudding at Le Village buffet was not good at all. I've had much better at every other buffet I've visited and I've been to a lot of buffets. 

I would say that the mashed potatoes and gratin potatoes along with macaroni and cheese along with alfredo pasta was good, yes I tried them all. They still did not make up for the price point and had me in the bathroom thirty minutes later.

As an avid buffet eater I've learned before purchasing buffet to ask the hostess if I can take a look at whats out. I normally do this whenever I visit a new buffet, but I did not do that this time, I wish I would have because it would have saved me money because i wouldnt have gotten the buffet."	2	Le Village Buffet	3
Our dinner at the Chart House tonight was excellent. Paul was our server, and he knew the menu inside and out. I have never had seafood prepared as perfectly as these guys did it. Scott's blackened fish was his perfection, and my swordfish was as moist and juicy as I have ever had it. Crab cakes were incredible, and the chocolate lava dessert left us craving more. Great job, guys...	5	Chart House	4
Hard to find, but well worth the effort. Barmaster Andrew made for the perfect night, with specialty cocktails created on the fly. We dove into the apps, and they inspired us to try things at home. All around great experience...	5	Carson Kitchen	4.5
Came back after a year, and dinner was every bit as good as we had hoped. The prime rib was superb, the sides were fantastic. This place has become a part of our Las Vegas standard protocol. Do give it a try. Ms. Pleasant was, indeed, most pleasant....	5	Lawry's The Prime Rib	4
"So first review on yelp, usually a lurker but had to comment for this place. 
So party of 2 and we showed up 30mins early on our reservation, place was empty , maybe three other parties present. They sat us immediately and then that was about it. We sat for about 10 minutes while the wait staff just hung out around us. No drink orders, no water, no acknowledgement, it was crazy, so we got up and left.
They gave zero f$&ks whether we stayed or left. So rather than throw money at a place like that we went else where."	1	Yusho	3
"the boyfriend and i got the runaround in the downtown vegas restaurants and the one we really wanted to go to after reviewing options was closed for a private event and after walking around everywhere and checking other places out (overpriced, not what we wanted) we were starving and annoyed.  We were in the mood for kbbq and this place was barely a cab ride away.  

we had to wait so, SO long for a table.  Our fault - last minute planning, saturday night, super busy.  They aren't exactly set up for people waiting but got us drinks (yuzu soju was CRAZY good and so was the ginger soju cooler if not a little sweet).  We waited forever.  and ever.  and ever.  

The we finally sat and ate the best freaking korean bbq ever.  The pickles, the appetizers (spicy tuna kimbap) totally unnecessary but SO tasty.  We got the meat lover package deal and it did not disappoint.  Everything was amazing - pork belly, bulgogi, we were FIGHTING over the last pieces of spicy pork.  Just so crazy good.  It took hours but we were so stuffed and happy and barely rolled ourselves back to the hotel.  Totally recommend."	5	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5
Surprisingly pretty great food. I ate here for breakfast twice with a group of 6-8. The service was very good both days and they were especially accommodating with our group - even bringing 6 separate checks one day, which was so appreciated. I had a goat cheese, sundried tomato omelet one day which was fresh and flavorful. The next day I had french toast with a side of fresh berries, which were equally as good, though didn't come with real maple syrup. The menu is your standard diner food without the greasiness and grunge of your standard diner. I would recommend.	4	Planet Dailies	3
Went with a big group. Our service was very good. I had the vegetable pot stickers and veggie lettuce wraps. Both were better than I expected. The lettuce wraps came with this fantastic fried tofu with so much flavor I thought I was eating teriyaki chicken. Overall this place is pretty casual, a combination of all types of "american" asian food from Chinese to sushi. Overall, the food was not very authentic but, for the price, pretty good.	4	Chin Chin	3.5
Always quick and good food. Service could get a little better though. Employees always seem like they're hassled to have to take your order.	5	Robertos Taco Shop	3.5

"I ordered from these guys tonight using BeyondMenu. I've ordered from this restaurant many times before and I've never had an issue. The food has always been good and the service is matched. 

Tonight was completely different though. I ordered the family dinner A and it gave me a list of eight options for my rice or chow mein item. I chose the combination chow mein. I added a couple more items and I put my order through which totaled $35, no problems. 

I received a call from the store about three minutes later. Some young girl, who didn't tell me her name, tells me combination chow mein isn't available as an option for family dinner A. So I ask her if that's not available as an option, why is it listed on the website they use for online ordering (BeyondMenu) as an option? She answers me ""we've never had a problem like this before."" I told her if it's an option available for me to choose then it is an option available. All I hear is silence then she responds by saying nobody else has had this problem. 

Now I'm pissed because I have a store calling me after I placed a $35 food order and telling me I have a problem. I demand to speak to a manager and this girl tells me they have a manager but they're not in the store right now and they're not available to speak because they're not there. 

So rather than owning their mistake and honoring the items offered on the website they use to place their orders, they lose a good size dinner order and a repeat customer. 

I hope the management from this restaurant reads these reviews and does something about this because it is absolutely ridiculous!"	1	Golden China	3.5
I was craving wings and Wing Stop was too far away. I drove by here and thought why not! The sign does say "best wings in town". Walked in and the place is dead quiet with no body in sight. A TV was on but no sound. A nice young man came out from the back and was very pleasent. Nothing spectacular. The menu is a bit overwelming. The prices have been changed and re-written over more than once. I was a little confused on what was what so got the number 1 which was 8 wings, fries and a soda (10 bucks). Took 15 mins for the food to cook which was no problem. I''ll wait for fresh food. I took it with me to go and when I got home I realized they are trying to be just like Wing Stop. The fries are exactly the same but the wings are not very good. They seemed freezer burnt when put in the fryer. I got half Cajun half Garlic Parm. The garlic parm had no flavor. Tasted like they were just covered in oil. The Cajun were ok, but nothing special. I wouldn't go back.	2	Wings Restaurant	2.5

"Went there for dinner a few weeks ago after a Cirque du Soleil show on Saturday. The place was packed and our server was really slow (took her 15 min just to bring water...) but that was the only negative comment I can make on this restaurant.
We mainly went there to try the foie gras which was perfect! It comes with fresh toasts and had so much flavor! It was definitely the highlight of our dinner. 
For entrées I got the mussels and my girlfriend got the salmon. Regarding the mussels, the dish was okay, not the best I ever had but it was decent, comes with Baguette to dip in the sauce.
The salmon was delicious, melting in your mouth and the sauce was great. 

Overall good atmosphere, just wish our service was a little better otherwise I would have given 5 stars."	4	BARDOT Brasserie	4.5
I love this place esp the salad dressings is to die for .. its just the salad is kinda too plain .. i love mochiko, teriyaki chicken is just regular im not too fond about .. steak are good cook as medium well .. love the sauces near the fountain drinks .. its just they need to keep up cleaning the dining area ..	4	Makai Pacific Island Grill	4.5
"Went here a few months ago with my coworker and haven't had the time to review this place but I give it one star because initially when we walked in it smelled. I didn't know if I was walking into a restaurant or a casino. 
Once my coworker and I got our food, we saw a beetle or some kind of bug crawling from the sauces on our table. It was quite disgusting. Probably won't come here again"	1	Viet Bistro	3.5
The Haupia bar is so good. I also tried the salmon Poké which was delicious. I heard their mochi is made on Monday's and still have yet to try! Will definitely be back.

Like my 30th plus time here and my bf and I can't get enough. Boba is too bomb and they have wifi ! My fave is the oolong milk tea with less sugar and boba and or nata jelly. Wish parking was more convenient during peak hours, but there's always parking along the side of the road by that Raku restaurant. I like how they greet customers with a "hi, welcome! or bye thank you!" when you enter\/exit. It's my #1 boba place in Vegas !	5	Kung Fu Tea	4.5

YUCK! I am sorry.	2	Chow King	3
Ok so I didn't know I did my review but like I came here after so many months thinking it'll improve but still I'm not amuse to that tocsilog chicken and rice the chicken taste like its raw I mean it seems cooked but I guess it's just the flavor idk what it is then the rice it's kinda hard like its been in the pan for too long so yeah and I ordered with leche flan but didn't get it so I guess I'll just cancel it. So yeah oh well it's very disappointing ..	2	Wok & Roll "TAPSILOGAN	4

The food are like average nothing special, soda is like 3 something to 4 bucks and I don't get refill then we have so much on our table but charge like 18% automaticly in each of our bill but then we all split it so we all get charge it's suppose to atleast like 15% I mean our server is like nice and stuff but if I want to get charge that much percentage of the bill atleast I get a refill for a fountain soda that cost like a freaking $1 smh it's my first time and not big with Italian food I got the pasta Alfredo fettuccine whatever taste so plain I ate mostly likely the Parmesan garlic bread I mean who can't make that better ..

.. so basically I don't recommend or even I am not coming back to this place it's nice to try a new place .. since the rating here was a descent enough to go ..

"Food is average, the server I got sucks as heck! He seems mad or having a bad day but greeting someone shouldn't even giving a tone like that .. and I don't think he knows food Handler safety also how he handle giving me the food I ordered .. 

Worst part is I ordered an ice coffee took about the same time other side that came last got theirs first .. sorry I do time whatever I get.. if I would've the other guy as a server I wouldn't be like this but oh well probly Im not coming back at all .."	1	Red Lantern Pho Vietnamese Grill	4.5

Worst drive thru .. so ordered a kids meal with an extra piece but I ordered another 2 extra piece shut I requested to have that extra piece inside the kids meal since it's not mine and but fucking girl or whatever she is in the window told me they can't move it coz they aren't allowed to touch the food like wtf .. its not even hard to do it wash your hands and grab a fucking gloves .. like i work for food industry and this shit never been a problem I ask the first window says it's OK just change the container wtf is wrong with the second window .. never gunna come back here i love canes but this place is shitty ass service just i am just at the drive thru smh ..	1	Raising Cane's	3.5
Food was alright! But the servers in the front keeps chit chatting like they dont focus that's why the line gets longer and its not organize when they called the customer to take the order.. or sometimes they will randomly dance like what is that?  People are hungry smh .. they need to be more attentive .. smh i have more to say but mostly thats my point of view of this place ..	2	Grill City	2.5
"low service
Server doesnt know how to interact with a guest 
Server gives bullshit why the food is late but then I got my food cold
I ordered ""fresh and not saugy canton"" which is that's not what I got smh 
Then the server said ""it's already pre made"" so I guess Max's food ain't fresh and they make you wait half to hour to get your food.

Just because I ordered ""Maxs Plate combo meal"" the server said that's why they don't recommend it because it takes a long time THEN wtf is it on the menu?! They don't have minimum time to take out the food out of the table, just because there's a party going on it doesn't mean you have to use that as an excuse.

Chef needs to be organize on there station not everyone focusin in the party I mean there's people waiting and hungry. 

It's a NIGHTMARE !!!!! Ugh

The drinks like soda cost $2.50 and the server doesn't even ask for a refill they care more other things than take care there tables or station.

And this is the thing he apologize to my mom I mean I am the one who is complaining like wtheck and I ask question I don't get straight up answer ! Yeah I look like a child but don't treat me like a child coz I am an adult having dinner with my mom.

My first exp is the worst already, second was better and then the third one is this one and I don't think I am planning to come I mean my mom said she will never come back too."	1	Max's Restaurant	3

People here were nice I only tasted the fried rice it's pretty good! I was just buying it for my bf since he work early morning at his job and about to go on the second without eating since I'm at the east side anyway and he told me he wanted a spam and I'm just searching where's the closes Hawaiian place from where I'm at and this pops out its pretty cool I would come back to eat what they really have !	4	Island Style Restaurant	4.5

First time here, friendly service, tried the sampler platter and I like the bread and everything.. i wasnt fine with the collard greens taste weird but other than that taste good	4	Billy's BBQ	4
This is like judgemental service I've ever experience maybe it's just im wearing my sweater where I work @ .. i mean I'm here coz my bf wanted Philly steak and im just ordering and the lady was on the phone and just smiled , I ordered #2 the sandwich only and she ask me where I work @ since I'm wearing my sweater so I told her and she told me that "our gyros are better" and im like ok like I really don't care and then she added "customer says" and i responded ok since I don't care im just here to order food not compare and since I didn't order gyro I pretty much shut my mouth smh ..	1	Philly Steak Express	4

Everywhere you see dirty dishes, like thats not good .. its a big place too they should hire more bussers other than talking to each other.. kids running around i mean its casual but it should be strict .. food was ok nothing exciting ..	2	Tasty BBQ Kitchen	3.5
"It was free, the workers were friendly, and there was plenty of variety. Why 2 stars?  Because, darnit, the food just wasn't very good. When the best part of the meal is that the diet coke was pretty fizzy, you know it's not worth $30. 

But, let's be honest: it was free with our stay at the Signature, and free is good. But DO NOT pay $30 to have dinner here. If it's free, Bon appetit!"	2	MGM Grand Buffet	2.5
Friendly owners and really good pizza. Try the stromboli for $8. We went to the slice-of-pizza side.	5	Bonnano's	3.5
We had a fantastic experience last night at Bavette's.  Our waitress was attentive and very knowledgeable.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and the side dishes that our waitress recommended matched up perfectly.  The GM even came over to say "hello" which was a nice touch and a good ending to a great meal.	5	Bavette's Steakhouse & Bar	4.5
Amazing crepes!  I had the ham and cheese crepe and it was sooo good.  Very rich and very filling.  They also have great salads and steak.  This is a go to place for me to take my clients each year for the various conferences that bring me to vegas.	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4

"This review is for the Grand Buffet's Breakfast\/Brunch menu.

I have been to the Grand Buffet plenty of times in the past, but usually only for dinner.  This time around, we tried them out for brunch, and was surprisingly disappointed! 

Though the price was right ($14.99\/person), the food was not.  The eggs seemed dry and old and the meat selections (bacon\/sausage) just didn't seem up to par -- how can you go wrong with bacon!?  There were other options that I didn't try (omelet bar, taco bar, etc.) but this review was for MY experience!

I'm not sure I'd go back here for brunch, but I know next time, if I do go...I'll save my appetite for dinner!"	3	MGM Grand Buffet	2.5
"We've seen commercials here in the Bay for Joe's...but we've never visited one until we drove by one in Vegas last week.  We walked in not really expecting too much (I was yelping as we were walking in!)...but lo and behold!  We ordered a few (yes, a few!) buckets of crabs and wow!  They were SO tasty!  AND, they didn't have any snow crabs that day, and had to substitute Dungeness for Snow....so we got a lot more for our money!

I think this is the first time that I've ever gotten full off of crabs sans rice!  Though we didn't have vinegar with garlic and salt....the butter did just fine!  

Service was also great and we were all glad that we FINALLY got to experience Joe's!  Now it's time to make like a tourist and head over to San Francisco!"	4	Joe's Crab Shack	3.5
"We decided to veer off the Strip in search for something different and not ""Strip-priced"" and ended up at Bahama Breeze.

We were pleasantly surprised at their menu, as they offered some of our favorite types of food!  I ordered the jerk chicken wings (of course!) and my daughter ordered their West Indies Patties.  Both were awesome!  The service was also good and our drinks were never empty.

We will definitely keep this place in mind next time we're in town!"	3	Bahama Breeze	4
"We barely didn't make it here as it was New Year's week and all of the restaurants on the Strip seemed to have been booked like there was no tomorrow!  Lucky for us, the wonderful MGM concierge were able to book us a (albeit very late!) reservation.

When I first walked in, I couldn't decide whether or not I hated or loved the decor.  Yes, it was ""fancy""...but I couldn't help but think that I was inside a Christmas present!  Everything was sparkly and our table had these little gold balls strewn about, with a very glittery\/sparkly table runner and these glittery twigs of some sort as the centerpiece.  I was a bit distracted at best until our waiter came and his French accent made me forget about the decor - at least for a moment or so.

I loved that the menu given to me didn't have prices, but the one given to my husband did!  I also love the bread cart that they bring out before dinner.  The milk bread was deelish, but I can do without the bacon twist (?)  As far as dinner went -- we had the 6 course tasting menu and every little dish served to us was fantastic!  My fave?  The chorizo soup...omg, that was to die for!  But everything was so good, it was fairly difficult to pick just one!  

I would love to come here again, but it's definitely a once in a lifetime deal...unless, of course, you've got some major cash to spare!"	5	Joël  Robuchon	4.5
This place is absolutely amazing. I have tried Peruvian food from here and its perfectly delicious. No need to go to any high priced restaurants when you get such yummy food at low prices. Id totally recommend people to go for this place. Exceptional food and excellent timely customer service. Looking forward to try more!!!	5	Inca Vs Azteca	4.5
Well. I just don't even know what to say. The hostess said a ten minute wait, but the place was empty. Then when we finally did get a seat by walking over and sitting at the bar, they didn't have any dim sum on the menu. I only came here for dim sum after seeing the advertisements ...all of which were pictures of dim sum. Apparently they only serve it from 11-3 on Friday-Sunday. So why on earth is EVERY advertisement of a food you don't serve...? Go home lemongrass, you're drunk.	1	Lemongrass	3.5
Horrible place! I was having a drink at the bar with a friend when this woman that worked there came over & told me to watch my language and not to drop anymore f bombs... Excuse me? That's not how you treat a customer & who the hell are you to tell me what not to say?! We are at a bar! Not a church or school so why am I being told what not to say...UNBELIEVABLE! I do not recommend this place & will never be going back!	1	Three Angry Wives	3

I was there on Mother's Day for dinner we ordered an appetizer and two entrees. We somehow got both at the same time instead of receiving our appetizer first then the server and food runner started arguing.	3	Maggiano's Little Italy	4

"It was my first time visiting Baguette Cafe today. It is a little bit hard to find as you can see the sign from the 215 going west,so you have to actually exit durango and make a right on sunset. It is located at the end of some office buildings. You can also access it from the frontage road and make a right. The owner,Olivier is very charming and will recommend you what to have if you are unsure. I had a Cafe Mocha which was served in a big porcelain cup and was very delicious. They serve Illy cafe which is an excellent espresso. I took Olivier's suggestion and ordered the chicken curry sandwich.I asked for it to be a little bit spicy. I was not disappointed at all as the sandwich turned out to be one of the best chicken currys i've had. I would recommend you sit outside if the weather permits. 

Overall great experience,great staff,excellent food and drink selection!"	5	Baguette Cafe	4.5
Absolutely my favourite sushi spot!For those of you sushi lovers,make sure you get the AYCE. It is about $27 per person for dinner and around $22 for lunch. When we go,we always try to sit at the bar as the chefs are very nice and it is quite entertaining to watch them cook. The only negative is that most of the nights the wait time is at around 45mins or more.But overall great food,always fresh fish and nice atmosphere!	5	Sushi House Goyemon	3.5

"Our waiter Chris, or as we like to call him ""Christ"" (said that on our receipt) was awesome.  It wouldn't have been the same experience without him and he was as funny as he was nice.  We had the restaurant week salad, chicken pesto sandwich, and sticky toffee pudding and a dogfish head IPA.  Everything was good, but the sticky toffee pudding was insanely amazing.  If you have one thing here, make sure its the sticky toffee pudding.

We will be putting Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill on our list of favorite Vegas restaurants and make sure to see Chris, the ""Cobra Kai"" waiter."	5	Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill	3.5
Awesome food as always but the parking sucks here and the service was a bit slow. Nevertheless the food rocks.	4	Buffalo Wild Wings	3.5
The drive through at this location is a nightmare but the inside has interesting decorum.	3	McDonald's	2
It's somehow impressive how incompetent this location is. I ordered 2 hard shell beef and cheese tacos, carne asada fries with no sour cream and beans, chips\/guac and a Mountain Dew. I went through the drive through and waited 10 minutes for my order...and somehow, someway they managed to screw up every single item I ordered. I received a Dr Pepper, Tacos with lettuce and fries with beans. The guacamole was technically correct but was a liquidy mess. I didn't have time to unwrap every single item so I only caught the drink being wrong, but needless to say I am never returning here again.	1	Don Tortaco	2.5
Awful. Extraordinarily slow service. Theming is all over the place. My daughter got the pasta and I got chicken strips, and her portion was far larger than mine and twice as cheap! The food was very bland. Sad!	1	TGI Fridays	2.5
Looking for a cheap lunch at the older end of The Strip, I stumbled across this place, knowing nothing about it. I could tell the minute I walked in, the place was authentic. Smoke and steam and yelling and people of all stripes waiting in line. It took me a few minutes to figure out the system of waiting in line according to what meat you want, and then paying for your meal at a separate counter. I was not daring enough to try some of the more exotic meats, so I went for the adobada (spiced pork). Waiting for my turn I got to watch several orders of these tacos get made. They have layers of marinated pork turning on a vertical rotisserie that is first skewered with whole pineapples. As the meat turns and heats, all that juice saturates the pork. The guy making the tacos would take a long knife and just carve down the face of the turning meat, getting enough shavings for one taco. Really fun to watch. I got two and found a place to sit in their outside tent. They were the best tacos I have ever tasted. I don't know if they're the best out there, but not being from the southwest or California, they opened up a whole new world for me. I immediately got back in line for two more.	5	Tacos El Gordo	4
"I have been wanting to come to Shake Shack for the longest time. This burger joint first started in New York in 2004, and spread to other East coast locations, and I was happy to find out they recently started opening on the West coast. Unfortunately, the only locations they have in California are all in SoCal. When they will open one in the Bay Area? I hope they open one in San Francisco someday. But as for right now, I will have to stop by when visiting LA. When looking for places to eat, I was ecstatic to see a Shake Shack on the Vegas Strip! It's near the NY NY hotel.

I came here around early lunch, and there was already a long line near the door, and tables were almost occupied. I ordered the Shackburger which is the standard cheeseburger, and as simple as it sounded, it was quite a delicious burger! This is not the typical burger you get from In N Out (sorry if you're a fan) but the burger had a thicker, juicier meat. I also tried their crinkle fries drizzled in cheese, and the regular kind. But for future visits, I'll stick to good ol' regular fries.

For dessert, I settled for the Shake Attack which is a chocolate custard ice cream with chocolate and cookie dough chunks. Which was a great, sweet treat, which was the perfect end to my meal.

Happen to have a burger craving and have a Shake Shack nearby? Don't hesitate to give it a try!"	5	Shake Shack	4
"The Buffet at Wynn is one of the best restaurants with an enchanting ambiance, out of all of the buffets on the Strip. Near the entrance, you will see a bunch of fresh, vibrant flowers surrounding a limited amount of tables which is the garden section. Upon request, anyone can sit here. My family and I had came here on a Thursday night just in time for dinner hour ($38.99), and had the opportunity to sit there, and we loved it! The weekend price is a dollar more, breakfast ($20.99) or lunch ($25.99)

They offer a variety of cuisines that range from Asian, American, Italian, Indian, and Latino, had a few made-to-order sections, and also a salad bar. My picks were more of the American-Italian and seafood options, such as the meatloaf, pasta, mashed potatoes, shrimp cocktail and baked salmon. The meatloaf was cooked just the way I like it, it had a soft texture, and seasoned well. Pasta was creamy and delicious, and the seafood was fresh. I also added corn and broccolini to balance out my meal, which were both cooked nicely, since I am not fond of tough, under-cooked vegetables.

Onto the desserts, my favorites were the raspberry cheesecake, chocolate lava (highly recommend) , and these edible cones topped with icing and a gummy candy. I also chose lychee ice cream and cookies and cream. They weren't overly sweet, both were on the light side.

I was able to leave satisfied. It is a pricy buffet, but you get exactly what you paid for in terms of quality and ambiance. I felt that I received my money's worth not only by the amount of plates, but how much each food on my plate was worth if sold elsewhere individually. Go give Wynn's Buffet a try!"	5	The Buffet	3.5
"While I enjoy the MGM Grand Hotel\/Resort...I am not a huge fan of the buffet. I have tried 3 times and have been disappointed every time. 

My issue is in comparison, the higher price sets an expectation that doesn't deliver. Most people want to feel like they are getting what they pay for and here just doesn't feel that way. The food does not sit for too long and there is a sizable selection.

 The MGM group has had deals that included free or cheap buffets and that makes sense....if you're paying for a buffet I would suggest going over to Excalibur."	2	MGM Grand Buffet	2.5
"A must stop for us every time we're in Vegas.  I always get the Island Lime Cooler and the Stranded on a Sandbar (both are no longer on the drink menu but the bartenders can still make them).  My fiance sticks with his perfect margarita - it's basically a tequilla martini. lol  

Beware the nachos (in a good way)!  They can feed an entire army.  And if that wasn't enough, you can add chicken\/steak to them too.  

IMO, the menu lacks some quality and variety, but I mostly come here for the drinks.  

Very disappointed that they no longer do the shows or play videos of Jimmy Buffet concerts.  Boooo.. dropped my rating to a 3 because of this."	3	Margaritaville	3.5
Such a fun stop to make while in Vegas.  Granted, it's in the Cosmo and I usually don't stay near it, but it's worth the trek.  You go down an unmarked hallway that is lined with records.  The pizza is superb.  There are some counters that you can stand at to eat, or you have to find a spot to sit down in the main area of the Cosmo.	4	Secret Pizza	4
Undoubtedly my new spot for reasonably priced craft beer while in Vegas.  You can order any size and take it to-go (they'll pour it into a plastic cup).  Cheers!	4	Yard House	4
Getting a reservation here was a little hard, but it was worth eating dinner at 10:15. The ambiance is great and very comfortable. The decor is classy as well, don't order too much!	5	Giada	3.5
"The food was fairly priced. I did enjoy the setting.  It was open, sunny and not too loud.  

I'd have given it more, but the service was a bit slow, and then one our dishes, a Chicken burger, was over cooked.  It felt like I was chewing on a piece of rubber.  

I'll skip the chicken next time."	3	I Love Burgers	3
"When you go to a fast food chain like this, there is really only two things you are looking for.  Is the food good and was it done correctly?

Based on the previous reviews I guess the hubby and I just got lucky :) I really enjoyed this place! Thought the decor was super funky and fun.  My meal was delicious, as was the hubbys.  Maybe our bodies were just starved for something that wasnt deep fried eaten at 5 a.m., who knows.  I ordered the carne asada tacos and my husband had the chicken burrito.  Everything tasted so fresh and yummy. Chips were very good, prices were good...I would definitely go here again.	4	Pink Taco	3.5
"The one downside to our Vegas trip....Hooters Casino\/Hotel\/shithole.  Okay, I admittedly like Hooters, and given the pricing and the fact that everyone coming from out of town for our best friends wedding was staying here we thought, why not?

oh boy, where do I start....the restaurant. We met everyone here the first night we got in.  I have eaten at Hooters before and have ALWAYS had good service, maybe I'm spoiled. The girls always smile, sit, etc....forget it here. The service sucks big time...she seemed bothered by us, which made us all want to agitate her more.  I must have asked for our drinks three times before i went up and got them myself (she was too busy chatting with another lame waitress and therefore to busy to actually wait on people) LAMMMMMMEEEE Food arrived and it was so-so, nothing like what we have eaten at the Dublin Hooters. 

Rooms: shitty, period.  The bathrooms sucked and were so old and outdated, it was comical. didnt smell like smoke, which was the only plus.  I am never staying here again, even if it was offered for free LOL"	1	Hooters Casino Hotel Las Vegas	2.5

The food was amazing and the service was top notch at Top of the World. 6 starts all the way and a definitely a must do when in Las Vegas.	5	Top of the World	4
Worse service, we had a bday there and the boss didn't even let us fridge the bday cake says it can be contaminated, but yet any other restaurant would've done it for us, the food was not good, we got the salmon and it literally tasted like they just added soy sauce to it, my friend ordered the glazed salmon and it tasted bad for her as well.  The only part that we might have liked was the appetizer fish sushi, not recommended and definitely my first and last time there, last but not least the bill came out to 800!! I could've had better food and service at Mcds	1	Andrea's	4
Everytime, I go to Vegas, I always try to make a trip to Fat Choy and get their Peking Duck Bao and Soft shell crab bao if it's in season. If you haven't been there, it's inside Eureka Casino. From the entrance, you have to go through the casino to get to the restaurant.	5	Fat Choy	4

Barcelona tapas is still good and still in the southern highlands plaza all these years. I've done the AYCE menu and it is amazing. The beef and chicken skewers are hearty with flavor and the bacon wrapped dates are always good. I always get an order of either mojoto or white sangria while coming to this establishment.	5	Barcelona Tapas	4
I'm not sure why this is low rated on here as I've lived in the southern highlands area for the past 8 years and have frequently picked up food and dined here.

Really disappointed after reading rec in USA Today and having locals endorse it. Read others' reviews about juicy burgers; ours were dry but still a bit cold in middle.  I had the pesto burger; everything but the meat was good. My husband's mushroom burger was also dry. Our fries and rings were unremarkable, and it wasn't as inexpensive as I expected. Cool to see inside.	2	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
It's crazy how alot of the reviews of this venue are bad. In terms of a trendy sports bar, drinking shots, grabbing quick barfood and beers, socializing with my coworkers and friends whenever here, I have always enjoyed this venue as I get off work and have come here for some SNF and Thursday. They did seem low on staff but each time, the restaurant was not slammed when I come here so I guess the other reviews were when it's busy here. Nachos could probably use more meat as they definitely do not stiff you on the chips. The quesadillas were  big and taste great, as well as the cheese sticks and buffalo wings. It does suck too how when I was here last time they ran out of flat bread for my friend who wanted to order that. Knowing Yardhouse was downstairs, I was hoping they had a great beer selection as they are a trendy looking sports bar but they did not have many beers so they did not seem to put up half a competition against to sway others from going to Yardhouse. Hopefully management works out some of the kinks of some of the disgruntled yelpers on here so their rating goes back up and the venue doesn't end up like its predecessor Cadillac Ranch.	3	McFadden's Restaurant and Saloon	2
It's nice to see a filipino restaurant on the southwest side of town. Staff was friendly, and service was quick, but my friend and I happen to go on a Thursday evening where it was slow.	4	Cebu Inasal	3
"I've been to this location in town square twice and both times I received terrible service. The first time here the servers ignored us and didn't pay attention and refill our drinks. The restaurant was about 25% capacity and yet our food took over 45 minutes to come out. A second time coming here we sat at the bar. The bartender was attentive and held good conversation but once again, the restaurant wasn't busy and the food took too long. 
Other than finding the smoked chicken amazing, the other sides and meat were relatively average. I could have went to Dicky's BBQ pit and received the same tasty food for less, served quicker and with better quality bbq sauce. I don't think I'll be going here anytime soon."	1	Pot Liquor CAS	3.5
I finally made it to this location after months of being open. We came on a Tuesday evening so it was not as busy and we waited 10min at most. The location has the same setup as all the other locations around the south with the rocking chairs, retail shop and the table seating and menu. I ordered country fried chicken with baked beans and a hash brown casserole. Everything was up to par with the other Cracker Barrel's I have been to and I will gladly come back again as long as the waits aren't ridiculous.	5	Cracker Barrel Old Country Store	3
The $17.99 AYCE deal is always good at this place. I always get the steamed egg, bulgogi, short ribs, ribeye and brisket. I even like the salad dressing they serve their house salads in. I like coming here once every couple months.	5	Tofu Hut	3.5
"Love this AYCA Sushi venue! At first my friends and I saw the 40 minute wait and the people waiting outside but realized it must be popular. We went ahead and waited it out and it was worth it for sure. It cost $20.95 person. Service was excellent as food came around fast and drinks were refilled. I ordered the seafood salad (as when you do the AYCE deal, you can have 1 salad per person). We were ordering all sorts of shrimp sushi rolls. The mussels were amazing as we shared 3 orders of that. We also got 2 orders of sesame chicken. I ordered some eel rolls that were also tasty. Great experience overall.

The reason I gave it four stars is because the place is very small and there was a wait to get in. We also tried to make a reservation here and they only do first come first serve. Other than that, I recommend this place to anyone that wants AYCE and doesn't mind the wait."	4	Yama Sushi	4
Fast and friendly service as well as the best reasonable price and value for hawaiian food in vegas. I usually get the spam masubi with an ahi poke bowl, brown rice and eggs over easy on top. Also I sometimes get the bbq chicken Teriyaki with brown rice and eggs on top. Nice protein for an after gym workout session!	5	Island Flavor 	4.5
I always love the  weekday 3-6pm happy hour on select beer and drinks at this spot. I usually order the brisket and bulgogi as well as the calamari. The restaurant is always clean and staff is friendly. I've had the other items on the menu before and they are on the pricy side but good. My bill during happy hour or getting the $49 meal for two is usually  the same as an all you can eat with a little bit less but higher quality food.	5	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5
"My boss is a big powerlifter so when he says a place is good (it may not be on the healthy side but more the meatlover side) IT'S GOOD.

I went in here after a long hike one time with a group of coworkers and absolutely pigged out.

Service is FAST here because they already have the various meats cooked. Even with this, the meat is very fresh. 

The only thing I'd ever ordered from here is the westerner because it is a roll and you can choose two different meats. I usually get the westerner with a beef brisket and pulled pork. Cheese, pickles and onions are also what they include in this but are optional. My favorite side items are carb loaded though with my usual mac and cheese or garlic mashed potatoes (with chives and cheese). 

They have a wealth of condiments such as 3 flavors of barbeque sauce: spicy, sweet and their special combination sauce which I love the most.

Also, they do have weekly specials from Monday-Friday.

Love how these guys cater as well.

Free vanilla ice cream on your way out at the exit is the bonus!

I am a regular at this place and recommend it to any of my friends who love meat."	5	Dickey's Barbecue Pit	3.5
"Awesome menu and fresh crabs! Manager is real cool as well.
Love their Tuesdays $2 blue crabs and $2 domestic bottles"	5	Crab Corner	4
This chain inside the Mirage Casino is great because it is located near the entrance facing the strip. The sports book is next door but you still don't smell all the cigarette smoke in here. I've gone here during lunch and enjoy their soup or salad and pizza deal. I usually get sat fast, the servers are friendly and I get my food out in a timely manner	4	California Pizza Kitchen	3
This is the closest thing to a european style doner kebab in Las Vegas. The meat needs to be shaved thinner and they need to serve it in the bread. Most likely you'd have to import the water from Europe for the bread to be on point. Other than that this is the best knockoff I've found in my search for a doner in Vegas.	5	Istanbul Mediterranean	4
"I knew about this location since two weeks before it opened but finally rounded up 4 of my friends to check it out a few weeks ago because I had a restaurant.com ticket. The location is accessible and convenient in that Jones & Spring Mountain\/west part of town.  We showed up here around 3-4pm and surprisingly the place was empty. 

We ordered calamari tasted a little overcooked when we had it as I thought the bread crumb they used was okay but nothing special. That same bread crumb was on their fried oysters that did have a little more taste and were not as overcooked. 

Also, we ordered their a pound of garlic shrimp and some Alaskan king crab legs in order to get the $100 certificate minimum and this was very delicious. We ordered their Lemon Pepper medium spice and an order of the Cravin' Cajun signature sauce for comparison and both tasted good. I believe some of the other locations, notably HnJ have more variety of seasoning and have a little more taste\/flavor but these two flavors were still good. 

Overall favor this place over Hot n Juicy Crawfish (both locations), Crab Corner and the newly opened SoCal based Boiling Crab location only because they do the Restaurant.com coupon deal."	4	Cravin' Cajun	3.5
"I've been going to this place now for 4 years and of course, it's for the midnight $3.95 steak and egg dinner. The NY Steak use to be 8oz. but they are now 7oz. but I still do not complain. I personally like my hash browns ""animal style"" like the fries at In-N-Out Burger so I order the hash browns with grilled onions and a side of thousand island dressing!

Service may sometimes take longer but only because it can occasionally get packed in there from all the other people ordering off their midnight menu. I also live right across the street though so it is very convenient for me. if I get the late night munchies after a night out."	5	Coronado Cafe	3
"As long as I can reminder during football season, this bar is a Cleveland Browns and Ohio State bar. The gaming area does haves the standard cigarette smoking smell as any other 24hr establishment in town. The bartenders make the drinks fast and are very friendly. I can tell because many of them have a local following who come in frequently and gossip. 

The pastas here are decent as well as the steak and eggs dinner. Sometimes I order the jalapeño poppers which they make very well. If I have any complaint from this place it is that a friend and I have ordered a side salad here a couple times and notice they load it with way too much salad dressing. Other than that it's great for locals who live in the south\/southwest side of town."	5	Boulevard Bar & Grille	4
"I'm glad this chain was out in the west coast once I moved from Kentucky to here. I started becoming a regular here because I became friends with one of their bartenders who has a big following that goes in there. 

The restaurant location is clean, the staff is friendly and I do enjoy all the bartenders that work behind the counter.

I guess the only issue I can see is how they do not have video poker or any form of gambling at the bar counter but that is alright. 

Most people like the steaks and bloomin' onion but I personally love their chopped salad. Even though I don't prefer bluecheese, the bluecheese dressing in this salad has a very amazing and addicting taste to it!"	5	Outback Steakhouse	3.5
"Amazing buffet. It was my second time eating here yesterday and it did not disappoint. I went with friends in town for dinner so the price on a Sunday was a hefty $55 but it did not disappoint. First time I was here was back in November on a Saturday early noon and the line was about a 20 minute wait. Yesterday, Sunday around 4:30pm there was no wait in line at all, but there was a rush of people whe we concluded our meal. 

On my first trip to this buffet, I had one of the best cooked prime ribs I'd ever had. On my second trip here, I strayed away from that and instead focused more on the seafood.

Presentation was unlike anything I've seen before. They had tiny little cute buckets of wings or fried chicken pieces with fries. The lasagna was served on a tiny skillet with a decent amount of meat and the sauce, was UNBELIEVABLE. The chef's special was also served on a tiny cute little iron pan and it was a lightly breaded calamari.

On my first trip, I thought the shrimps were bigger and the king crab legs were small portions and were also very salty. But I realized this was only because it was busier back in November when I went as there was a 5min wait to get the king crabs. This second time around, there was alot less of a wait and I just realized the workers there can serve you warmed up king crab that is dipped in hot water. I got my king crab served this way this time around and they were far less salty and on point and of course, dipped it in the melted butter!! 

In the seafood section I also enjoyed the baked salmon, pan seared halibut, mussels, half shell oysters, corn lobster bisque, the large shrimp, and an amazing oyster shooter! 

Instead of prime rib, I thought I'd try the pork ribs and the lamb chops. The chops were amazing and very juicy! The pork ribs, on the other hand were not so much. 

I was hoping for standing chocolate ice cream but they had one that had cinnamon that I wasn't too big a fan of. 

Overall, this place is highly recommended by me if you have friends in town."	5	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"I'm originally from the east coast and south so I was happy when they brought this chain to Las Vegas.

I will admit the food here is not on the healthy side so if you're looking for a diet friendly establishment, I would suggest going elsewhere. But this is not why I rated this place 3 stars. The milkshakes are awesome as I am a fan of the chocolate flavored ones and they have a huge menu of these to choose from ranging from their regular chocolate, mocha, or Hershey's dark syrup. Also, I enjoy their chili mac supreme meals with a plate of fries. 

One of my gripes is that when South Point expanded their casino, they seem to have a lot of wasted space that could've been used to make this restaurant space larger because this restaurant is almost always packed with a long line. However, if you are in a hurry, you can always just order takeout and possibly sit by the deli restaurant tables section or booths both near the sportsbook to eat the meal."	3	Steak 'n Shake	3.5
I go to this restaurant every now and then on my day off or if I need to satisfy my Thai food fix. I'm usually here during lunch time and take advantage of that. They have the standard items you would expect at a Thai restaurant. I've ordered the chicken satay, beef jerky (which comes with tasty chili sauce), beef salad and chicken pad Thai. The manager Nina and her staff are friendly and make sure the food comes out fast.	5	Ping Pong Thai Restaurant	3.5
I'm happy there is a Korean bbq restaurant on the southwest side of town instead of having to go to Chinatown. My first time I've ever been here I was satisfied with how clean the restaurant was and the modern look they have. The chopsticks are not wood. The food is honestly about the same as any other AYCE chain but I prefer this place mainly for its location and how clean it is.	5	Doh Korean BBQ	4
"I've been to this place about 3-4 times. It has a nice setup and is relatively center strip since it is located at the PH Miracle Mile shops. The bar has an outside area with heat lamps, tables and a full bar with TVs. Upon walking through the entrance of the mall, there is a stand with pretty ladies where you can buy drinks. The bar also has a main room and then a side room so in total, I count 4 bars. I've always been to this bar when it is not busy during the week so food service has always been relatively fast with friendly waitresses.  I'd imagine this place gets slammed during sports watching events.

I ordered the chicken fingers and they were relatively greasy but decent. They do in fact have decent happy hour prices during the afternoons. I ate here today with some friends and we split some potato skins and a taco pizza. The skins were cooked perfectly and the taco pizza had alot of taste. I ordered a steak salad which was not too bad either.

I give this place 3 stars for being a typical sports bar in Vegas that has the overpriced bar food that although has a nice bar atmosphere, they have alot of competition around the strip and do not exactly separate themselves from it."	3	PBR Rock Bar & Grill	3
60 cent wing Tuesdays, closest bdubs to the strip as well as my house, and an amazing setup for watching sports	4	Buffalo Wild Wings	2.5
"I like how you can make your pizza the way you want with their various sauces and toppings at this restaurant. The high quality ingredients and servers and cooks are in front of you so you can see them prepare their food like at a subway or chipotle. 

My only concern is that it is a small corner location so sometimes they can get filled with not many places to sit during peak hours. The pizzas are baked in ten minutes time and come out hot."	5	Pieology Pizzeria	4
Love this place! The chicken is always fresh, restaurant always clean and it's the closest one to the strip! And that sauce...	4	Raising Cane's	4
"I enjoyed this place 2 days ago because I met up with friends who noticed as of October 2011, they started a 25 cent taco and Corona special from 5-9pm on Mondays. The Coronas are small 7oz ones but ordering 2 of them is just 50 cents and 2oz more than your typical $2-3 12oz can\/bottle of beer around town. The tacos also include pretty tasty chicken, beef or grilled fish, given the price. Catch this promo while it lasts as well as show up earlier because they did run out of the Coronas around 40 minutes prior to the end of the hour.

I didn't get to try the fajitas but they did smell good as usual when they came out (what doesn't smell bad when a  grilled sauteed garlic, onions and bell peppers come sizzling out!)

Good note: Silverton has decent free Wi-Fi internet. The phone reception kind of sucked that far in but the internet was good.

I also am not sure if Mi Casa still is part of that $1 all well drinks on Thursday evenings during that bar crawl at Silverton. Hope this helps."	3	Mi Casa Grill Cantina	3.5

"Ate here yesterday for dinner with a friend because we did not want to spend a whole lot on food. I ordered the ribeye tasted to order and my friend ordered the special that day which was a roasted piece of chicken. The chicken was a huge portion for the price paid.

They do also have a Chinese menu but we will save that for another time."	3	Cafe Cortez	3.5
"One of the best things about this restaurant is that it's at the front of the Caesars Forum Shops. You can valet your car here and go right in without walking deep into the shops where many other places like Cheese factory etc. are.
Everyone employed here are friendly and informative. I've been going to this restaurant the past ten years and I still see a lot of the staff still working here so people are obviously making good money and are taken care of. 

When I come here for lunch, I generally order the lump crab salad and get a side or the mustard sauce used when they serve the stone crab claws. When I order dinner I order a couple of their massive Madagascar shrimp, tomatoes with cheese and corn. Every now and then I will get the Alaskan king crab or stone crab claws but they are also known for their steaks. 

My favorite cut is their dry aged bone in ribeye. The sommeliers know their wines as I trust their judgement. Even sitting at the front bar I have spotted various celebrities. Five star service all the way."	5	Joes Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab	4.5
I live on the south end of town so I am not always at this casino as all the other residents of Summerlin may be. However, when it is not overly hot in Vegas, this has become a favorite monthly spot to frequent after a medium-strenuous hike up Red Rock Canyon! Shrimp cocktail are small, Asian menu is adequate and the prime rib and is standard\/above average for a Vegas buffet.  The Mexican and Italian menus are standard to me as well. My two favorite dishes are their pulled pork and chocolate ice cream! I believe M Resort's buffet still has a slight edge over this one in terms of off the strip casino buffet as well as selection. But overall the the buffet with or without the casino reward card is cheap and you get great value for how much it costs.	4	Feast Buffet	3.5
Awesome lunch specials as well as happy hours! I usually stop by here with coworkers to watch football games and always liked the reasonable price of meals here. There are a number of restaurants that have come and gone	5	Miller's Ale House - Las Vegas	3.5
Nice locals spot for those who live on the south side of town. The bar is isolated by itself and it always seems like there are alot of people parked here every time I've been. The food is decent, the bear is clean, the staff is friendly and it is a cozy area to watch sports to to meet up with friends.	4	Distill - A Local Bar	4
"I'm from the east coast but for the longest time, have heard of this place and not ventured in to try a burger until yesterday.

First thing I enjoyed were the complementary salted roasted peanuts. This was good because it's great for people that are hungry and cannot wait to be served.

My friends went during the evening after 5pm and there wasn't much of a wait to order. To pretty much sum up why this place is awesome:

No wait in line
Establishment was clean
Extra toppings for free
Two of those high tech fancy coke product dispensers that pours 10-15 different types of beverages.
Good location off the Las Vegas Blvd for those on the south end of the strip.

This place is up there with In N Out Burger and is less of a wait."	4	Five Guys	4
This breakfast restaurant has been in the southern highlands plaza for awhile and I've never had a bad experience here other than maybe a 10min wait at most because it can get busy. The fresh squeezed orange juice and freshly baked pot of bread with powdered sugar are amazing. I've ordered many items in the past among those the corned beef hash, ribeye steak and eggs, salmon lox bagel, steak and spinach eggs benedict, chicken fried steak and all are good.	5	Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place	4
I have gone to this location with my friend for lunch for many years now and have received  excellent service. You cannot  beat the prices of lunch here as I've almost always order the chicken fajita with either a bowl of soup or salad. We can both order these and the bill is still under $20! The quesadillas are excellent and chips and salsa are as well. Their bar has a nice setup of booths and high tables as well as a round bar with multiple televisions. Definitely try this spot for a cheap lunch near the LV blvd and I-15 or I-215	5	Chili's	3
This is just a standard Vegas 24hr McDonald's which is attached to a Chevron that is the closest one to where I live. Always relatively clean and trash is taken out when I'm here. Breakfast, lunch and graveyard menu are up to standard which I'd expect from a $4-8 menu (ordering fries, spicy McChicken and McDoubles from the dollar menu and McNuggets). I finally had those Mighty Wings and they were pretty large and tasty!	3	McDonald's	1.5
I would have given this place 3 stars but it gets that fourth one because the sports book odds at this place ARE THE BEST IN THE CITY. I won an extra $100 just because the future odds of a team winning were 6-1 here versus 5-1 everywhere else at the time. (UK Wildcat basketball baby!!)	4	LVH - Las Vegas Hotel & Casino	2.5
"Nice to see this restaurant make its way to Vegas. I have never been to one so I ventured in here during lunch over the weekend. As expected, since it is located on the second\/third floor of Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops, the location gets great foot traffic from people on the strip or those coming from the bridge from the Cosmopolitan or Crystals\/Aria. The retail store has all sorts of neat shirts, accessories and souvenirs and you have to go up the stairs to access the restaurant section. My eye caught the Stupid is as Stupid Does Shirt!

Since I was on a lunch break I did not take long and went to the bar. 

The only TVs I saw were at the bar and I did not see any in the regular dining area so I for now, I do not believe this is a good spot to try to catch any game; only come for the fish and shrimp dining!

I asked the bartender's recommendation and went with a cup of Mama Blues Shrimp Gumbo. He explained the gumbo as having worchestire sauce in it with a little kick and I like that sauce in my marinades so I was sold.  Surely enough, there was a little spice but 

The main course I ordered was the accidental fish\/shrimp. This was a broiled mahi mahi with jasmine rice, grilled shrimp that came with a side of lemon butter with roma tomatoes. I've had freshly caught mahi mahi in Hawaii so I have a high standard when it comes to this fish. The one they served came very close but not quite that standard. It was a generous portion and came with some shrimp which I thought could have been bigger. 

The price of the meal was kind of high as well but that's what's expected from restaurants on the Vegas strip. This was a great experience and hopefully I'll buddy up with one of the staff there to come back in and get a discounted hookup. lol."	4	Bubba Gump Shrimp	3.5
"This is a nice place for drinking wine off of the strip but still reasonably close to it; being in Town Square. Also, it is definitely better priced and is bigger than the other location which is in the Palazzo Shops on the second floor right on the strip.

My alumni club hosted a fashionably dress to impress Kentucky Derby party at this venue. The restaurant had a fine selection of wine for our wine junkies and was also able to change up their bar with bourbon offerings such as Woodford Reserve Double Oak for our special event. Mint julips were on point and meals were reasonably priced."	4	Double Helix Wine & Whiskey Lounge	4
"Hands down this is Las Vegas best mom and pop style Italian cuisine off the strip. I usually don't order a meatball anywhere else because the meatball marinara from this place is the gold standard that most other establishments can't mimic. 

There is just so much flavor in this and in every other item I've ordered here. You have to be hungry if you order the chicken Parmesan because it is a large piece of battered chicken! The garden salads with their oil and vinegar dressings have many ingredients. The spaghetti and meatballs are always good as the sauce is soaked well into the noodles."	5	Trattoria Italia	4.5
"This place has great discounts on drinks and appetizers most likely to drive business. $3.50 wells and beers such as Stella Artois are a win! My friends ordered nachos but they didn't look like they liked them much. Bartender as others are saying did seem slower. 

In terms of an arcade venue, the space is massive and seems like they devoted too much room for restaurant as opposed to adding more games; possibly a bigger bowling alley with more lanes. I did not get to check out the LAN they had setup; next time!"	4	GameWorks	3
"I've been going to this restaurant chain for the past four years and love it because of it being 24 hours opened right in my neighborhood. Warning: this is not for those health conscious and is more for those who need a late night Mexican fix and want something better than Taco Bell. Health nuts should just get cucumber from the salad bar or should already be home asleep after a night of clubbing. 



My go-to meal is the carne asada burrito. My cousin's go-to meal are the carne asada fries (and trust me they don't stiff you at all on the carne asada unlike other restaurants). Before, I would sometimes get the carne asada chimi chonga meal but no longer. 

The facility is clean; they always have a stocked up bar of salsa, lime and fresh cucumber."	4	Roberto's Taco Shop	3
I checked this place out in between work one time for lunch with a coworker. I couldn't believe there was an actual place with lobster rolls. I am a harsh critic because I frequent Boston, my original place of birth quite a bit and have had it fresh there. I ordered their Original Maine Lobster Roll with fries. I liked the presentation when the roll came out with the claws on the top of the toasted bun. The roll tasted great! It wasn't too seasoned, not too garlicy. The lobster meat was fresh and I will definitely go back to this establishment.	4	Lobster ME	3.5
"This is a brand new PTs location off Silverado Ranch and Decatur and I consider this a secret nice bar this side of town because it is not as busy. 
The bar and restroom areas are very clean. The staff is friendly and the food comes out the way I like it ordered. Of course the standard 4-7 happy hour specials on pizza and drinks is honored here just like the other locations."	5	PT's Gold	3
I just tried their new "Butter Royale" premium sauce at home, after I found them at the Las Vegas Food Festival last weekend. All I can say is WOW!  I put it on baked Salmon, right at the end for about 5 minutes in the oven and it was Fantastic!  Going back tomorrow to the restaurant to get some more!  Highly recommended. I think now it's available on Amazon.	5	Urban Turban	4
Great tacos, fast service but NOT "fast food".  Its made to order, really awesome tacos!  Highly recommended, gotta try it if you like street tacos, best I've ever had.	5	Trillo's Street Tacos	4.5
This is my favorite chicken fingers place, huge chicken portions and the best fries I've ever had. Friendly service and loved the 70s classic rock music . They have a lot of great sauces to choose from I try new one every time I come in.	5	The Chicken Shack	3.5
Great authentic Mexican food. Lots of seafood options too. and it looks like a great place for a party with karaoke and open space dance floor.  friendly staff, great service. highly recommend	5	Chupy's Mexican Restaurant	5
"For the price, I was surprised by the great variety that Sushi Mon offered! Unlike other AYCE sushi restaurants, Sushi Mon had great quality rolls, each with a unique quality! You can opt to not do AYCE, but I think it's a great value, esp for the lunch pricez

They have a lot of different sushi that you can get too, and the fish to rice ratio isnt bad at all. The sushi tasted pretty fresh, and I had no complaints of any of the fish. All the rolls there were pretty great too. Cant remember the names of the rolls... But I really enjoyed them all! (Check out my photos!)

The service was quite fast, which I appreciated. Sushi Mon is located in a huge plaza, and parking is no problem. 


They also have dessert as part of AYCE so leave some room! Will probably be back when Im in the area again!"	4	Sushi Mon	4
Flavorful, tasty, and greasy tacos are just the thing drunk people look for after a night of partying and dancing. That's exactly how I stumbled upon this taco shop, just like probably 75% of everyone else that come here too LOL. Tacos el Gordo is a classic, and it's well known not only in Vegas but all over Southern California and Tijuana. I've been to the location in San Diego and I wanted to give this place a try as well. Considering the fact that it was 3am, the line was fairly long. I waiting about 30 min for my food. Definitely try the adobada tacos here, and ask for the pineapple!! I don't know if it was because I was buzzed or if the tacos were really that good, or probably both... But the tacos here were great!! I got some snobby attitude by the ladies at the cashier but tbh I didn't care too much lol. Definitely stop by Tacos el Gordo for some cheap food to grub on if you're in the area!!	4	Tacos El Gordo	4
"Our favorite Mexican food!  Fresh, handmade tortillas, super fresh salad and ingredients.  The house dressing is the BEST!  Our favorite meal is the veggie salad with house dressing.  It's like a salad and a burrito in one meal.  So huge and filling.  
We take our 3 year old with us and they always add a kid's quesadilla for free.
Cafe Rio always has great service and the restaurant is always clean.  Please come to Northern California!"	5	Cafe Rio	3.5
"Came here for lunch buffet. An average selection of food, nothing to ""wow"" over. The food was average, as expected but I just didn't get the ""wow this was worth it"" feel you know?  

The service was great though, always had waiters coming around taking plates, and asking if we needed any beverages. Perhaps the dinner is better, will definitely try again though. Just hoping next time won't be as disappointing."	2	The Buffet	3.5
"Just wanted to find some Thai food. We ended up yelping something and ended up here. The wait was around 30 minutes since we didn't have a reservation. The bar area was a little strange since it looked onto the entire dining area. I felt that people were looking at me awkwardly. 

Seated, waiter was very sneaky. Creeped up behind me quietly and startled me but it gave me a good laugh. We got an appetizer and a few entrees. The food was good, tasted as expected. But that wasn't even the best part. 

Don't get the duck addon for anything. The bill came and my friend was shocked that his portion was around $30 dollars. The waiter mistook him for wanting the dish with duck and wrote down ""crispy duck addon"" instead. Of course the ""preparation"" of frying the duck cost an additional $10 dollars, but of course the waiter did not know how much extra it would cost, and didn't think of asking a manager or something. I just thought it was hilarious."	3	Lotus of Siam	4
VERY RUDE!! I'm a frequent customer here I came almost every week but the owner is extremely rude. Many times he's said that we always mess everything up and all we do is order extra topping but we're paying for them! We were good customers but he always gave us an attitude. Our last draw was when we went to order and he had a new cashier and she took our order and hereh the owner came out and checked the order and he told his cashier in front of us "this people are always a problem" who says that! Customers are always a priority and specially when we always brought our good manners and respect for his business. He's a very rude person and has no respect towards people, it's has not been the first time that he treated us wrong. I'm never going there again, DO NOT RECOMMEND this place!!!!!	1	Oh Curry	4.5
I was just there. I had French toast, 3 eggs w\/bacon. If you know the difference in good food, this is an excellent breakfast. The staff is as good as the food.	5	Mr. Mamas	4.5
This is a beautiful restaurant unfortunately the sushi tastes like it came from a grocery store. My roll included what was supposed to be crab on the top. It was crab like but was definitely not crab.	1	Red Sushi	3

"I went here on the Saturday night before Father's Day for a bachelorette party.  We had requested to be seated in Tao Beach and they had said, up to 2 hours beforehand that night, that it was first come first serve. We followed their instructions for bottle service and got their early before 10:30pm.  Ten girls with bottle service yet they still made us wait in line for 30 minutes. Still, no big deal.

 They seated us in a cramped room with seats for only half our party. We were informed then that Tao Beach ended up being closed that night because they believed it was going to be a slow night due to Father's Day. If we had known, we would have gone somewhere else. Exactly why they were vague over the phone. The place got so crowded that I had my head hit over three times by people dancing or just passing by the aisle behind the couch. I had a huge headache by the end of the night.

Close to 3am, the room we were in started dying down. They started moving table service groups to the main dance floor area, stating that they were ""upgrading us."" We ended up following the promoter as he led us around on a wild goose chase. The table that he thought was empty was not.  As he was trying to figure out where to put us, we stood in a single file line squished up between the dancing crowd and the people at the table. 

45 minutes later, we end up back at our original table with only half our party and the room completely empty. They offered us a round of shots to compensate us. Are you serious? We still had half a bottle of vodka left that we could have polished off the last hour. Why would we need your free shots? Weak.

Finally, the guy agrees to give us one free bottle the next time we go to Vegas. We agreed to this since we were planning on going to Vegas in September for another bachelorette. Now, as we try to contact him to honor his agreement, he is not responding. Terrible. 

Tao: Liars, poor service, waste of money"	1	Tao Nightclub	3
"Best steak out there.  We ordered the double eagle 26 oz bone in cut along with the stone crab claws.  Steak was cooked the way we liked it, and as we requested.  Medium with a pink inside...not bloody.  Perfection in taste with the right char on the outside and flavors bursting from everywhere.  Hands down, this is the place to get steak.  We just caught the end of stone crab season.  Lots of meat in those claws and we ordered the large, not the jumbo.  Lemon cake was absolutely amazing and moist.  I wasn't much of a fan of the lemon cake but after that, I most definitely am.

What made our dining experience cool was the amazing service Brian gave us, as well as the manager, Amanda, stopping by to greet and chat. Amanda and Brian were warm and friendly, as well as professional.  The staff and food make the place what it is.  We were there to celebrate our anniversary as well as babymoon, and they made it special for us.

There are locals hanging out at the bar and enjoying happy hour.  Somehow, the place doesn't seem as stuffy, but do go in there dressed somewhat decently .   This is now my wife's and my top place to get steak."	5	Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House	4.5
While Wynn's Buffet doesn't seem to have the high selection of items that Bacchanal does, I would have to say Wynn's Buffet is the best.  The best parts were the rib eye steak and king crab legs.  And yes, do heat them crab legs over at the Italian station.  The salads were great and they even had a Ramen and street taco section with dedicated people to cook them upon request.  Selection is so-so but the quality is much better.  Rib eye steak was awesome. The only negative I have to say is the lack of fresh fruits.  There was only a melon\/cantaloupe mix and nothing else.  Perhaps it's the time of the year (first weekend of Feb), but if there was room for improvement, it would be that.  Line wasn't that bad either.  While Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon may be the hot buffets, stick to this one where you can enjoy better quality.  I didn't want the vast selections of mediocrity and definitely didn't want to waste my stomach on pizza and cheap sushi.  Be selective and choose wisely.  I really did enjoy my experience there.	5	The Buffet	3.5
Best pizza I have had west of the Mississippi! Crust was very much like the east coast pizza I was raised on. Toppings were plentiful. We did takeout but will come back and have a sit down meal. Highly recommend!!	5	Anna Marie's Italian Cuisine	4
Amazing food.  Exceptional service.  Our waiter Larry took special care of us and even brought modified dishes for the two individuals at the table that had food allergies.  Highly recommended.  We were a party of 20 and the waiter gave each one of us his undivided attention and he worked with the chef to honor every food request !	5	Sinatra	4
"Did you know that a medium-sized bowl of wonton noodle soup will set you back $18 and a bowl of udon soup costs $22 on the Vegas strip?  If you are like me and find those prices outrageous for very average tasting food, then head a couple miles to Big Wong's on Spring Mountain Road!

Everything is under $10, with most items under $6.

I enjoyed a late lunch with my family here & we ordered a couple Shrimp wonton noodle soups, one spicy shrimp wonton soup, the salt & pepper chicken, the salt & pepper shrimp, chicken curry roti, and the hainan boneless chicken with seasoned rice.  The food was excellent all around but the broth in the spicy shrimp soup was the best I've had in a long time!  

One thing to note - the roti bread that comes with the chicken curry is not the typical South Asian variety you find at an Indian restaurant.  Rather, it is a flaky sesame ""bing"" (Chinese pancake) - the type you can buy frozen from the Asian market for $1.  Still very good, just FYI.

Next time, I'm going to try the soy sauce chicken. The table next to ours ordered it just before we finished our meal and it looked delicious!"	4	Big Wong Restaurant	4
This place was alright, I liked that they had a vegan option however it was not that great. It had avocado, tomato, and spring lettuce (I think) with their "special sauce". I didn't like the sauce at all, and it just wasn't anything special at all. I think it was around 6 bucks, however I also got their pistachio iced coffee and LOVED that. My friend got a regular waffle which just tasted like a waffle lol & got the peach tea which she said tasted like water but I thought it tasted good. So overall good place if you think waffle sandwiches are cool and you just want to try one but don't expect anything outstanding.	3	Tiabi Coffee & Waffle	4.5
The desserts were pretty and tasty, the service was friendly and courteous and fast. I didn't love the sorbet-ish extra course thing that came with the prix fixe, but my chestnut cream cake thing was pretty perfect. I was sad that the edible menu machine was broken, but hopefully it'll be back up and running soon, if it isn't already.	4	Sweets Raku	4.5
"So I'm in Vegas for a 530-person Scrabble tournament, where I'll get to see a ton of my similarly-geeky friends. Leading up to the event, the thing I was most excited about after the chance to revel in wordsmithery was being able to return to Bouchon, this time with the husband in tow (which meant I had semi-control over ordering two meals, not just one, which we would then split in whatever fashion I deemed acceptable).

He got the breakfast jardiniere (eggs, brioche toast, potatoes lyonnaise, spinach, fruit, juice, tea, and a pastry -- we got chocolate almond croissant).  I got the brioche french toast and a side of corned beef hash (not on the menu, but they'll make you whatever you ask for here, within reason -- it was $8.50 in case you're curious) and a coffee. 

Everything was great. Eggs cooked perfectly, toast light and fluffy, spinach buttery and rich, potatoes well-crisped (and also buttery and rich). The french toast was quite rich and sweet - I definitely wouldn't have been able to eat a whole serving, but about 40% of the serving was perfect for me. The corned beef was well-seasoned and savory, the potatoes were small cubes, well-crisped -- I'm not sure that the two married perfectly, as I think the potatoes were a little too crispy to integrate just right into the meat, but I still ate all of it. The chocolate almond croissant was crazy good. I have read this recipe in the cookbook, and all the steps that go into making it, and now I can see why it's all worth all that work. If there's an almond or chocolate almond croissant on the specials menu when you're there, get it. 

Service was smooth early on, though it got a little slower as the place filled up (it was surprisingly full by 830am on a Friday), and we got someone else's toast delivered to us, so he went toast-less for longer than he probably should have until they figured it out. Thanks for the extra toast, Bouchon :) 

Any time I'm in Vegas, this will be a breakfast stop."	5	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
i don't have much to add that hasn't been said before!  between two of us, we had popcorn at the O performance as our appetizer, then appetizers at FIX as our dinner.  the spicy tuna on rice cakes was fantastic, although a little annoying to serve two people five pieces.  then again, we got three burgers, so perhaps we were supposed to compromise on who got the extra burger vs th extra ahi.  we were more diplomatic and split both, but cutting a tiny sushi bite in half after drinking champagne is quite the exercise in motor skills.  i think there were an even number of mac n cheese sticks... i could've eaten a whole second order quite easily.  dipping the fries in the sauces that came with the sticks was also lovely.  yum.  plus, the two of us had plenty of food for a price reasonable enough to allow for gelato at the cafe (or crepes at jean-philippe) for dessert.	4	FIX	3.5
I have no complaints about my stay - everything about it met my expectations.  The room (one of the remodeled ones) was comfortable, the mattress was just how I liked it (which was one of the biggest surprises for the price point), the iPod dock was great, and saved me from having to plug into my computer to charge it, and it was reasonably quiet at the hotel, probably because it isn't one of the fancy, popular, expensive ones.  Just don't eat at the asian restaurant - I should've run across the street and had McDonalds - the quality would've been better.  We also bought monorail passes - it's about 2\/3 of a mile to the Las Vegas Hilton station if you cut through the parking lot, and that gives you a little bit of walking to help exercise away the calories that you put on eating in this town, plus access to the further away casinos for much cheaper and less trafficky than cabs or the deuce bus.	3	Riviera Hotel & Casino	2.5
solid fare for the exceptionally lazy over-eater.  not up for the walk to and from the buffet line?  no worries, the buffet comes to you, or at least the carving stations do.  the meats ranged from succulent and amazing to desiccated and gnarly (but hey, it's all you can eat - just set that gross rib aside and wait til new, fresh ones come out).  i loved the plantains, but i love all plantains, and i love sweet foods in a savory meal.  the cheesy biscuits were also good, and required restraint - must save room for meat was the general philosophy here.  the service was attentive, and the drinks were tasty, though not particularly strong.  i'd rather eat on the cheap (as much as that's possible in vegas) and splurge at fogo de chao in one of its multiple locales for a more inspired and satisfying churrascuria experience.	3	Samba	3
"pretty great for the price plus view, like everyone else has said. the menu is very detailed, which i prefer. i had a good sense of what my food would be, and the server was helpful in describing things i was less familiar with (like pheasant).

The amuse of cheese puffs (whose fancy french name escapes me right now) was perfect - light with a hint of fennel (i think it was fennel) and great.  Crispy Michigan farmstead Artisanal Camembert with Almond Apricot Petite Salad was our appetizer - would've been better wrapped in puff pastry instead of wonton skin, but it was a great bit of cheese and the accompaniments were sized and paired well.

I had braised short ribs as my main, and my goodness were they rich.  the fat hadn't quite melted down the way you'd want it to, so i found myself eating around it a lot, but the portion was big enough that i felt like i got plenty of meat, despite leaving quite a bit. the chestnut spaetzle was probably fine - i didn't care for the texture, but i think that's more me than how they cooked it.  my friend and co-worker loved her surf and turf - i tried the turf offering and it was definitely among the butterier, tastier tenderloins of my recent memory.  

Chocolate souffle was a little much richness on top of everything else, but somehow, we managed to eat it all :) the coffee was also rich and fantastic, and came with those raw sugar lumps that i just want to dump out of the bowl and into my pocket for later.  the bill was not unreasonable for what we had once you take the view and service into account.  very lovely meal."	4	Eiffel Tower	4
"Wove through the maze of the hotel to find this location, which wasn't particularly easy. It was totally freezing inside, which i'm sure during the worst part of the day is great, but at 8am, it was a little much. 

We were seated and had coffee quickly. Food came out superfast, was fresh and, obviously, plentiful. I ate about a quarter of the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, fed some to my fellow diners, and took even more back to our hotel for others. The chicken and biscuit were moist and flavorful, the bacon was crispy and plentiful, and the potatoes were great. I pushed aside most of the sauce on top and just went for the chicken -- sauce on the side would've probably helped control the balance better.

 I cannot imagine anyone eating this whole crazy thing. I wish there was a tasting portion so that you could just have three perfect bites, as I think that that would be more satisfying and in line with how I like to eat, but I totally get that that's not the idea here.

So, bring your friends (or let them sleep in and bring them leftovers), and come early, and it seems like the worries about sogginess, slowness, etc., aren't an issue. But bring a sweatshirt. Brr."	3	Hash House A Go Go	4
"My meal suffered only because I had so many other ridiculously rich meals leading up to it. A group of eleven of us showed up -- randomly, in the middle of a weekday, but even so, it's nice when you can get a group of that size seated by someone who's super-nice about making it happen and making you feel welcome rather than being distraught that you have no reservation.

The iPad drink menu felt a little over the top, but it was shiny and fun to play with. 

Duck poutine was a little too fancy to seem authentic, but it was tasty. Portion was a bit on the small side for the price, but it might've been that we were starving and just ate it really fast. I had the giant burger and more fries (yay more fries -- tasty, handcut fries). The tomatoes felt like a little too much on balance with the other toppings, but it was juicy, good bun, and I swapped in lettuce for the advertised frisee, which I much preferred. 

Yeah, everything was a little more expensive than I'd want to pay, but that's Vegas. I'd still go again."	4	Public House	3.5
"A friend and I shared our first meal at BLT Burger, after a 6.5 hour flight that involved leaving the house at 5am.  Thus, a plate of bran flakes would've probably gotten a decent number of stars for the chance to be on the ground in Vegas after the trip.

Clearly, BLT Burger provided a better meal than bran flakes. We got one of the 'combo meals' of burger + regular fries + shake, and a side of sweet potato fries and another shake (malibu\/ pineapple\/ something for her, espresso\/ kahlua for me).  This was plenty of food for two people, and saved a bit of money that we could later spend on the slots.  The sweet potato fries were much better than the regular, and the burger was properly juicy with a nice, soft bun.  Nothing super special, but still good.

The shakes were the highlight.  They were thick, rich, and topped with plenty of whipped cream.  I wish the straw had a slightly larger diameter, but that's a tiny criticism.  There was some vigorous sucking involved in getting all that goodness up the tiny little straw.

Service was good, water service was reasonable, price was what you'd expect from Vegas, and shakes get the place to about a 3.5, and I'll round up for the happiness that I had from getting off that plane and into a nice, comfy booth."	4	BLT Burger	3.5
It is a fun, energetic bar and grill on the Strip. If you want energy, fun wait-staff, and a great place to watch sports and\/or people, this is a good place to do it. The food is decent yet plentiful. I've heard they changed the menus since I last tried it, so I can't fully vouch for it anymore. It gets insanely busy when there are big sporting events.	4	Diablo's Cantina	3
I went here with high expectations. Band was stellar. Well worth the cover charge even tho the hostess was trying to persuade me to sit at the bar instead of paying. Whatevs. The bad part was tho I wanted to pay for a table for dinner, they sat me at a dirty table with no place settings. Gross. Relocated myself to a dinner table and had a horrible waitress, Lakeisha -- needs to learn how to serve tables! Was rude, yelling at the hostesses, even as the food runner brought my entree, the salad\/ old wine glass was never removed. Why let dirty dishes sit in front of your guest at such a nice place? Good thing the meal was one of the best ive tasted! Carolina salmon, on top of creamed corn, it was Delicious!!!! As waitress trompped around, I felt uncomfortable but tried to enjoy the ambiance. I was going to stay around at the bar to enjoy the band but the bathrooms were so far away I never went back and I am glad i didnt. It was the first time in a VERY long time I left a 10 percent tip but with such lack luster service, i think this was generous.	2	BB King's Blues Club	3
I travel to Las Vegas often and tend to try the buffet at the hotel I stay at. It's a given that not everything will be stellar but there is normally one item that I particularly enjoy. Not this time. I was so hoping for something that I even had dessert and I admit the cannoli were above par. The server, Maria, was outstanding.	2	Golden Nugget Buffet	2.5
Stopped here for dinner at about 1800. Took a long while for the busy bartender to get to me and neglect to give me chips. My hunger subsided a bit so I just ordered a chicken quesadilla and received a cheese one instead. The order was made right but the food was bland and uneventful. Chicken seemed unseasoned. At least the beer was cold. Won't be back.	2	La Salsa	3
It's rare that one recalls a sandwich five months after it has been eaten but this place made it. Excellent rolls (don't get me started), great seasoning and superior meats - made me feel like I was back in the 'burg in Trenton at one of the little Italian places. Very friendly staff as well.	5	Capriotti's Sandwich Shop	4
I always love this place and have been going for a few years now. I'm seriously addicted to their red velvet pancakes but have also had their banana foster ones to and they were just as delicious. My kids love their s'mores pancakes as well. Once you have pancakes here then other pancakes don't taste as good.	5	BabyStacks Cafe	4
I would give no stars if I could. Ordered a vanilla latte and literally got a cup of iced milk. I asked if I could get another one that had more espresso in it and so then I literally was given a cup of just iced espresso after having to wait an additional 15 minutes on it and it tasted horrible. The service was poor and one guy had been waiting to order for about 10 minutes before someone helped him but this was after a few employees walked past him even looking at him sometimes. Finally the cashier (the same one who was supposed to be fixing my coffee) came out from the back with some cups.	1	McDonald's	2.5
This is the cutest little restaurant hidden away. And the waitress, Shirley is just so pleasant. She reminds me of the old school waitresses you see in the 50s dinners. The food was also good as well.	5	Jamms Restaurant	4.5
stayed at the venetian for a weekend. im so disapointed i didnt try this earlier in my stay.  came back to the hotel really drunk and hungry, we went to the cruddy pizza joint in the nearby food court.  the night we left though, we decided to try it. awww man the soup here would have definetly hit the spot after a night of drinking. beef noodle soup:  spicy broth, tender beef, good noodles. and its open late! would have really wanted to try more of the menu. we sat at the bar area and watched all the orders go out. next time im in vegas, im coming here late night forget steak and eggs.	4	Noodle Asia	3.5
This place is amazing truly truly amazing. I bought a thing in groupon for this restaurant since it was going to be my gf and I anniversary and we were going to Vegas so why not. The deal consisted on 2 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers, and 2 entrees for 40 bucks so why the heck not. We got the tapas plate, backed brie, 2 glasses of moscato, a salad and a soup.  My gf got the chicken marsala and I got the Oscars Filet. The food was amazing and I extremely recommend it this place. If you are in Vegas give this place a chance the bill came for 120 and I only payed 20 bucks. The service was top notch and didnt yelled at me for breaking a lamp which by the way I am sorry about. Needless to say my gf and I will be coming to eat to this place if we are ever in vegas.	5	Grape Street	3.5
It really takes Indian cuisine in Las Vegas to a higher level.  Before I give it a five star, I needed to try it for the third time, and yes beside the slow service, the rest was absolutely a great experience (and worth the wait).  We had the shared platter for appetizers, and biryani, as well as their butter chicken. All delicious, and not heavy. Carlos was great, and when I asked for a sample of their home made masala mixture, the chef came personally, and gave me a generous portion.	5	Urban Turban	4
Spend your money elsewhere. The food is okay, not really worth the amount they charge. The best thing to order from here would be the drinks. I will not take that away from them. I believe that when we my food is served it should be hot and fresh. The fries were seasoned well but my food was lukewarm by the time it arrived. A very small amount of fries were put on the plate. I ordered the Double BLT Grilled Cheese and it definitely could have been better, nothing special. The only thing that is reasonably priced are the desserts. The red velvet sundae was good, not to overwhelming and not to small. Customer service is not welcoming and barely check up on you to see if you need another drink or anything. Must have just been the waiter. Be careful, they like to charge twice so just make sure you check your bank account. Instead of charging my tip and total together, they charged separately. I was charged once for my meal, and then charged again for my meal including tip. $40, the first time, $50 the second time. I like the candy store, but the restaurant should uphold their reputation and pricy foods by their performance and actions. Not worth the money or time....Go to Serendipity instead, although the food there is also pricy, it tastes MUCH better, & the desserts are excellent. They fill your plate and dessert with a great amount of food. The customer service is MUCH better and more personalized and comforting. Not too overly involved but you feel welcomed. I also did not get charged twice for my meal, which Sugar Factory has done nothing about. I will not be going to Sugar Factory again, don't waste your time & money.	2	Sugar Factory American Brasserie	3
A gem I stumbled upon while driving from McCarran airport. A family owned business, this restaurant has a cozy feel and the wait staff is friendly and attentive. I ordered from the specials board and a few appetizers from the main menu and have to say I was not disappointed with a single dish. They served complimentary edamame and fresh wasabi (winner in my books!) and the prices are reasonable for the quality of fresh fish that you get. My only bad comment is that they close on Sunday's and Monday's but I suppose that's a good problem to have!	5	Blue Sea Sushi and Izakaya	4
Absolutely amazing breakfast. The setting reminded me of Portland Oregon's eastside with the laid back friendly atmosphere. Our group had the chicken fried steak, a prime rib hash, and my delicious dish, the huevos motulenos (not sure if I spelled that right). The mix of flavors were paired beautifully with the unexpected sweet banana, feta cheese, black beans, a milder verde sauce with a zippier red on top over easy eggs with a side of onions and potatoes. Get a side of avocado to top it off and some fresh squeezed orange juice and get your day going right! Be sure to get there before 11 am for breakfast though because there is a cut off.	5	Eat.	4
"All. You. Can. Eat! 
Sat at the sushi bar & watched them make our food! Excellent sushi date! Affordable too! I recommend this place :-)"	5	Yama Sushi	4
"The food was good enough, but very expensive. Service was not great, they forgot more than one order. When I asked for horse radish, I finally had to go to the kitchen and get it, and they charged $4 for it. They added 28% for their tip.
They did have Brussels sprouts with ham and marshmallows, so that was good."	3	Herbs & Rye	4
My husband & I came here for a nice dinner while on our honeymoon...the service,food & drinks were phenomenal and the ambience was still slightly rock and roll but just up our alley! No complaints from our visit! They even gave us complimentary champagne! Will definitely be coming back!	5	35 Steaks + Martinis	4
"The comment from the concierge that ""the restaurant that you probably could have gotten reservations to is just down the promenade and near the stairs"" pretty much sums up the restaurant.

The decor is nice, the food good and the service solid.  Nothing too impressive.  My surf and turf was too salty and the appetizers that we got, the lobster macaroni & cheese and calamari, were decent.  

Overall, it's a solid place to grab a bite to eat, but with all of the other restaurant options in Las Vegas, this is probably one to skip unless you have a large party and need a place at the last minute."	3	Table 10	3.5
Me and my family are very picky about Indian food as we want it to be perfect! This restaurant was EXCELLENT, from their customer service to food, it met all our needs! I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone whether you live in Las Vegas or your visiting like us. I had never tried pindi khurkure, actually never heard of this dish. Pindi Khurkure was so delicious!	5	Mint Indian Bistro	4
I was persuaded by some local waiters in Vegas to try SW. When visiting Vegas for steaks I had always had excellent experiences at Palms, Prime & Ruth Chris. My appetizers were excellent, but after a prolonged wait for my bone\/in ribeye, it was hard and overcooked. After calling for the metre\/d, the response was an acknowledgment. I proceeded to pay my bill and tip at 18% to show class. However, I will not be going to SW again and will advise my friends not to do s.	2	SW Steakhouse	4
I like to order for pick up, it's faster! I love their bandido panini!! Not too spicy and I love turkey with sundried tomatoes!	3	Spicy Pickle	3
This may be one of the worst buffets I've ever been to considering the food quality and price. For $41 dinner before tax and tip, you don't expect the best food but it should at least be decent. Practically everything was mediocre and you can tell the food quality is no good. I even saw some bruised\/rotting grapes in the fruit cocktail. There was a huge variety of food, but it just wasn't good food. This place used to be good some years ago, but not anymore. The people from our group who have been there in the past were all disappointed this time around. One person in our group went to the bathroom like 3 times that night. No surprise there lol. There was no line or wait during dinner, which makes sense. Skip if you have any kind of food standards	2	Wicked Spoon	3.5
My husband, my 11 year old son and I were there in July. My husband didn't like sushi and was sceptics to go there. Guess what!! My husband was surprised of how he liked all the food, from appetizer, main courses and dessert. My son and I loved it, too! We will definetely go back there.	5	Yonaka Modern Japanese	4.5
This place is very clean and the food is so good! I ordered the pork bun sliders, garlic fried rice with goat meat, and a couple of coconut mojitos!! The waiter was very nice and always asked if we needed anything.  I would definitely come back. This place also has a huge bar!!	5	District One	4
The super sample was so much food!! It fed 10 plus ppl!! My fave was the pulled pork, bread, bbq sauce and Mac n cheese!! I would try this again!!	5	Rollin Smoke Barbeque	4.5
The staff was very friendly, menus simple, and prices reasonable! We were greeted right away, didn't wait long for a table and staff kept checking on us while we wait! The decor was interesting to look at and backyard patio had a nice ambiance! The place is small but a great place to lounge, drink and eat fondue. The wine in baby bottles was interesting and fun! I'd definitely come back!	5	F Pigalle	4
This is the only Chinese place we go to eat! Not too greasy and over cooked! I have a Chinese cuisine next to my place but I rather drive miles to this place! I spent 50.00 or so for 6 people...price is exceptional! I alway call for pick up and they have it ready by the time I get there! It hard to find the best Chinese place in town but I'm glad I found mines! I usually order the combo fried rice, chow fun, beef broccoli, spicy chicken, and won ton soup!	5	Golden China Chinese Cuisine	3
The best sushi place...service and food is great!! I ordered the Kona, big island,and Salmon lover with cucumber, crab salad! They serve poke too!! Japanese and Hawaiian s a good combo! This place is at the top of my list!!	5	Island Sushi & Grill	4
I love to order the garlic shrimp and rice especially the masubis!! There price is reasonable and quality is great! Their service is fast too! I always order pick up on my lunch and they always have it ready by the time I get there! They are always polite to me too!! I pick this over L&L and Aloha Kitchen any day!!	5	Ohana Hawaiian Bbq	4
The ambience is nice and friendly. I ordered the Chicken&Waffle plate and it wasn't cooked properly so I asked to replace it with the #Merica and the kind server, Rica, was kind enough to do so. The Merica was a much better choice. Thank you for making my experience a nice one!!!	4	SkinnyFATS	4.5
"Love this place!!! 
Everything is perfect from the charcuterie plate (highly recommended!) to the fresh pasta tasting menu.  We did this place up with wine pairings too and forced down dessert which we couldn't finish.  The staff is excellent, especially the wine sommelier.  They even brought us extra wines to try since we were very interested in everything.  Yes, it's expensive but worth it if you skip a show and have this as your entertainment.  I can't wait to go back in a couple weeks!"	5	B&B Ristorante	3.5
"I now have a new favorite to add to my list of Vegas must do's....We have been to all of the other Jose Andres restaurants in Vegas including the secret (shhh) restaurant.  See other posts...  We knew we were in for a treat here.  Please pace yourself with the amount of dishes you order as this is a lot of meat so items are a little heavier even for small plates.  The server will tell you to order more of course, but you can always add later!  

We shared everything and started with the Chef's choice charcuterie platter (really could share with 3 or 4 people), the tomato bread (so addicted to this as they also serve it at Jaleo), then the paella with pork short rib (daily special and this could really be one entree but they consider it an app! soooo delicious, the meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly with some crunch on the outside and tender fall off the bone meat, and the rice is really made from pasta but still has that crust on the top....my mouth is watering...  Then we had the bone on strip loin.  (so much better than it sounds on the menu.  I was afraid of the miso mustard, but it's served on the side and doesn't take away from the flavor of the meat.  The meat was so tender and melt in your mouth.  We couldn't finish it.  The sides were Robuchon mashed potatoes (check your cholesterol goodness) and the brussel sprout petals (more like a salad than warm side but really good).  We were too full for dessert so we have to come back!  awww.... The drinks were creative and so worth it. The wine list is reasonable and you can't have a bad pick.  The dinner was expensive but we were so happy and felt it was well worth the prices.  Our server was awesome!  I can't wait to come back!!!"	5	Bazaar Meat by José Andrés	4
"We came here twice.  The second time service was awesome!  The waiter we had was so attentive and cool as in hip to everything.  The food was amazing and deliciously consistent with the New York location, but you're in Vegas!!!  
It's nice they have seasonal items so there is always something new to try.  I started with the autumn vegetable soup (dreamy and creamy), my husband had the tartart special.  He loved it and wouldn't share.  Then we had a pasta course, I can't stop getting the spaghetti.....i can't!  Colin got the short rib agnolotti, which was very buttery good...  Then we had the nerve to share the 24 oz ribeye,  it was soooooo good, tender and perfectly seasoned.  We actually ate it all!  plus the sides, horseradish mashed potatoes....

Mario, the manager was extremely nice and helped us out with a service problem we experienced on our last visit and made everything perfect for this visit.  We did not expect the extra desserts brought out for us to try.  You have to try the little donuts (bomboloni) and the coconut panacotta was very tropical with a guava sauce...My favorite group, Depeche Mode was playing and when they found out, they changed the playlist to only play their songs!  
There are so many choices of places to try in Vegas and this is a must.  Worth every penny and worth several more visits."	5	Scarpetta	4
So disappointed.  We were so excited to visit Rick Moonen's place and the menu looked great online.   We were sat in front of the Dyson fan and the room was almost empty so we moved ourselves a table over.  We waited a long time for our drinks and had to mention it to the manager when he came by to say hi.  Our waiter was a nice person but not very good.  He never acknowledged the delay with the drinks.   I wanted a baked potato since I saw the remains of one go by,  but when I ordered it, they said they were out of them which is weird cause not many people were there. I know that is not a reason for the low rating, but it's all part of my downward spiral here.  Food was not paced out.  They brought our dinner while we were still having our appetizer. I ordered the New York steak medium and it was pretty tough and rare.  The first bite of the steak was medium which is when I said everything was okay when they asked but really rare after that and I couldn't eat it.  The food came lukewarm which is surprising since again, there weren't that many other people there when we ordered so not sure what happened.    I was dying for the manager to come back and ask us again how we were doing.  When our waiter came back towards the end and asked how the food was, I mentioned the steak was too rare so I couldn't eat it, and he said oh, and just took my plate.  With that much food left, no one asked if we wanted a box or anything.  For 50.00 for a steak, I might have wanted to take it home and cook it. But, I really just wanted to leave as everything was so wrong and I guess I expected too much because of the chef.  There is so much to choose from in Vegas, please choose that instead.	2	Rx Boiler Room	4
"We love this place!  Second time and everything was perfect!
We didn't want to waddle out like last time so we paced ourselves.
Started with the speck and mozzarella appetizer.  Creamy and delicious!
Follwed by the orecchiete with sausage, amazing!
Then we went separate meat dishes, bone in ribeye for one and myself bone on new york steak.  sides were the roasted beets and mashed potatoes with poached egg and bacon...  Buttery, creamy and so flavorful!  The steaks were prepared perfectly!  
The sommelier paired a couple glasses with our pasta and meat dishes and it was the best wine for the food we could imagine!  Dessert was pumpkin steam cake with pecans in a syrup so seasonally perfect and sweet! and my hubby had the panna cotta which he loved and wasn't too sweet.  
Our waiter was aweseome!  Very attentive, friendly and helpful with the menu.
We will be back again and again!"	5	Carnevino	3.5
After a second visit, I am rating this 4 stars instead of my thoughts of 5 stars from the previous visit.   The service was fast, our server was fun and friendly.  They do push a little too much for you to order many items at once, but keep in mind you can order a few things and add on later.  We did not order dessert because we were too full from ordering too many items.  The drinks were just okay and we felt they were overpriced, like the "Blood of the Gods" cocktail which was very small, sweeter than expecting and lacking flavors.  Food wise, the quality of the ingredients are the freshest around.  The tempura was slightly disappointing as we have basic tempura in our minds but the plate was small pieces sitting in a sauce so there is really not much crunch.  Toro was to die for!  The salmon belly sushi roll, so flavorful!	4	Nobu	4
It's exciting coming to the restaurant and not as exciting after you leave.  Coming up the elevator, seeing the views, you feel like you are going to be in for a grand experience.  We had also been to Mixx Restaurant and had very high hopes.  The food was just okay.   Our waiter was nice.  The drinks were good.  It wasn't a grand experience.  I wouldn't go back.	3	Rivea	4
"We really looked forward to a perfect experience but only a couple things that semi ruined our time.  There was an obnoxious older couple that kept blowing their noses quite loudly into the napkins.
It happened several times during our meal which made it difficult to enjoy.  Other than that service was nice.  We had the 16 course tasting menu and loved every bite. We received copies of our menu and a bag of goodies to take.  Highly recommend trying this indulgent adventure once!"	4	Joël  Robuchon	4.5
"Wow!  We walked out of here saying what just happened to us?  My husband is not into molecular gastronomy so like a good wife, I didn't tell him.  We really enjoyed the way you check in at Jaleo, and are taken back to a separate dining room with a counter for only 8 people.  It's creeepy dark but not too dark to take pictures which they allow.  One of us did the platinum pairing and one of us did the other pairing.  Guess who the lucky one was?  If you're going to try something once, and you can swing the extra for the platinum, it's so worth it.   I tried some amazing wines that are rare but such an experience.  The presentation of each dish was like a graceful performance in a fancy show.  We were mesmerized by each small plate.  The cocktails they slip in throughout the meal are crazy!  Here have this ball on a spoon, bam!  You just had a cava mojito with a hint of lime....what?  
We relished every dish and every sip of this meal.  
It's hard to explain all 24 courses because it's not just flavor, it's a feeling, experience, mood altering, seeing is believing show.  Truffle cotton candy?  yum...
Now my husband is looking up WD-50 in New York... a place he swore we would never go.  heh heh heh....."	5	é by José Andrés	4.5
Ordered pinakbet normally order this in Max Glendale Ca.  Do not order this I was disappointed with the taste it's dry and not tasty.  Same thing with crispy patA.  Not going back to this Max location.  Max Fried chicken in Glendale Ca is still the best.	2	Max's Restaurant	3
Great experiences...! Very friendly atmosphere. Expensive but worth the value as they serve high quality stuff that not every restaurant do. A lot of wow even before food was served. Large varieties of sake. Unfortunately, server was not well suggest or educate us enough. Home made tofu was a great experience. Not happy with the foie gras bowl as the foie gras was not sear to perfection. That was maybe the chef was in hurry to cook it. It was the last dish that came out as they had forgotten our order.	4	Raku	4.5
Always busy, taste great and value for money. But go there when you are about to be hungry as the wait is always long. Don't go there when you are very hungry. Open 24\/7 best time is after 2am to 7am no wait. Verrrryyyy Fresh oyster. Bouillabaisse was the best.	5	Oyster Bar	4.5
"Not impress at all. Tom Yam soup was one star, it taste like plain water added with lime and chilies flake. Panang curry was like Chinese or Mexican cook prepare that dish. Chilean sea bass with Som Tam salad was not exciting and authentic. Grapes and apple was added to som tam salad. Go back to the authentic flavor of Thailand please.
Somehow the place was busy and crowded. I guess that is call faith or no better choice in Vegas.
Service and the support staff was very nice and professional. 
Komol restaurant near by was much better quality of taste."	2	Lotus of Siam	4
Definitely a must come back place food was delicious and customer service is great the atmosphere was awesome the server great shoutout to Jose will definitely come back	5	El Segundo Sol	4
Were it just for the food, I would have given this a 3 or maybe 4 star...alas.  Let's start with the good, they had a tuna tar tar that was out of this world....after I grabbed my 8th little serving, they stopped bringing it out...at least the prime rib was delicious....but the carving guy kept giving me a small piece followed by some random piece of gristle that he had to get rid of.  Desert bar was fabulous...so were the drinks.  Unfortunately, getting our waitress to come over was nearly impossible.  There was never an opportunity to order more drinks, plates were cleared only after it looked like they might topple onto the floor.  This is one of those places where the tip is applied in advance...which as you can see, does not encourage them to be attentive.  And it wasn't one of those tips that left you thinking...oh, only 15%, I would have gone higher...no, this was I think a 22% tip...do yourself a favor...save your money...and enjoy the better, less expensive, and more hospitable Wynn buffet	2	Wicked Spoon	3.5
We went to Otto for lunch a few weeks back. We'd eaten there a few times before and had really enjoyed it. I'm a fan of Joe and Mario and mama Lydia. Does Lydia know that you put Boquerones on the Pizza Romana? I just can't imagine that anyone thought that a Spanish White Anchovy in vinegar was appropriate for a Pizza with big gobs of undercooked Mozzarella. That Pizza was undercooked, gooey, and had vinegary fish on it! Yuck! Our other dish, the grilled Radicchio with smoked mozzarella on the other hand was completely overcooked. The Radicchio charred and ashy, the cheese crispy and sweaty. Big Disappointment. Service was very good. I did say something to manager about Boquerones being a strange item with undercooked cheese and she said that it has always been that way. hmmm. Anyway, very expensive and very unremarkable.	2	Otto Enoteca Pizzeria	3.5
Worst pho on spring mountain rd!!!! No sprouts, only two piece of tai in large bowl. Dry old spring rolls. Horrible customer service.  Had to chase down server. Hen yum was basically an uncut onion, not even sliced!!  On the plus side, at least the water didn't taste like it came straight from the tap	1	Pho Saigon 8	3.5
Food sucked.... Service sucked.... Strong drinks!!!!!! ......paid to be treated like a DICK!!!!!! Loved it	5	Dick's Last Resort	3
Bar service was great! The restaurant service was the WORST!!! Terrible waitresses! Asked for a salad... no salad left... asked for another item... nothing left... finally asked what is available on the menu... ummm she says I don't know... an hour later got our hamburgers that was all there was left... another hour later had to track her down and get the check... awful awful service in the restaurant!	1	Bacon Bar	3.5
Terrible service~Ok food. Took about 1 hour to get a personal pizza and another 45 minutes for the check which never came. Who knows where the server disappeared to???	2	Pizza Rock	4
Our server John was great! And the food was terrific! On our next visit from Los Angeles we will definitely return!	5	Egg Works	4.5
Love it! Pork belly tacos are the best and the sweet Korean sauce is addicting. I love how they already know what I want whenever I call in for take out.	5	KoMex Fusion	4.5
Great furniture and great price! I like how none of the employees pressure you on purchasing any of the stuff. They are just there to greet and help you! My only place for furniture.	4	IKEA	3.5
It's pretty hard to find a Chinese restaurant that's decent enough to just grab and go. This place is perfect for that. The food is pretty good and I like that the cooks wear hats! They give pretty good portions too.	4	China Hot Wok	4
"I love it! They have this place in the very back that they cook authentic korean food. The halmeoni that coordinates it and I think that she is the chef and she is great! She can be a little tough, but don't mind her she's just very busy. The food is authentic korean and home cooked style. I wish she would cook some of the other favorites like bulgogi and galbi. I've always wondered why they don't. If she did I'll be there every day! 

The store part is like every other Asian market. The produce is excellent quality! I love it!"	5	Greenland Supermarket	4
I order take out from them a lot. The Galbi is great and the stir fry spicey squid. I don't think the squid is on their menu though, but everytime I ask they always make it for me. I know about it because I'm familiar with korean food. I wish they would bring back the Gamja jorim though. I've ate there and experienced the whole korean bbq as well. Not the best, but it's a nice experience.	4	Lee's Korean BBQ	3.5
We were told there was a 20 minute wait. We found ourself waiting outside for 3 hours, listening to terrible sad music. When they said they had a table for us we asked how long it would take for our food, and they said at the earliest 45 minutes, even after lying to us and making us wait 3 hours (no exaggeration). As we walked to our table we saw many other open tables, so we left because  we were so angry with them and could not believe our eyes. When we left, the manager cussed us out... I have never been so angry in my life. They are liars and disrespectful people.	1	Canaletto Ristorante Veneto	3.5
"First time: 5 stars
+ I seriously left dreaming about this place and couldn't wait to return
+ Really fresh fish
+ AYCE sushi that's affordable
+ AYCE includes desserts (I ordered 3 -  yes, I have a sweet tooth)
+ Special nigiri items can be ordered as well
- Long wait (but it was totally worth it)
- No sashimi

Second time: 4 stars
+ Wait wasn't as long
- Fish wasn't as fresh 

Overall would definitely return to this off-the-strip AYCE sushi joint.  It's such a good deal and the fresh is relatively fresh.  If you're not into sushi they have other options as well.  Till next time Goyemon!"	4	Sushi House Goyemon	3.5
Surprised how good this pizza was. 16" pepperoni pizza was excellent and only cost $8.50! This is a steal. Cooked perfect, good amount of cheese and pepperoni. Very well seasoned. I will make this a regular stop. Pizza was ready for pick up at dinner time in just 15 minutes.	5	Express Pizza	3
Breakfast was poor at this newer location. Croissantwich was stale, bun was hard. Employee agrued with me versus just replacing it. No coffee, they had to make it, but it took 10 minutes. Employee said "we have only one coffee maker and it is 30 years old". Coffee was thick and gross. Service overall was slow. I can see why this Burger King was empty at 7:30-8:00 am. Go to another location.	1	Burger King	3
"Meh. I've experienced better. Pretty ritzy but nothing special more than a neighborhood diner. Cheese nom noms were a cute name for dry noodles with barely any sauce on the inside. At least they were free (at the time) with Foursquare checkin. Fried pickles were interesting, at least they were the only thing that came out hot. The nom noms were warm, but my main course, the quail egg sliders were a total disappointment. It was like the bread was day old and they didn't bother to warm them to a steamy temp. They just looked pre-toasted and even he meat wasn't piping hot. Which I would expect from a burger joint. The service was lackluster, they were just chatting to earn tips, but if you really wanted something, you'd be hard pressed to get their attention. It felt more like I was being questioned about my being there as opposed to friendly welcomes and get to know you's. Tell the manager? You bet I did. And no apology, it was just an ""I'm glad you told me,"" and ""I agree.."" They know they got your money. They just didn't plan on a full review on the poor customer service.

They would have gotten 2 stars if they remedied it, but I'm taking away one star and putting it in the bottom of the barrel. It's kitchy, but really. You can get a better burger at a more upscale place and have your mouth be drooling. This place just sucks. Even the menu was sticky. Gross. Which was exactly how I felt leaving. Not even a goodbye, thank you for coming was uttered to me. Nice front door eye candy, but that's how they get you."	1	I Love Burgers	3
"Let's see, prices high for what it was. I thought it felt a bit uncomfortable. Might be a ood place for a date because you're not bothered much, but when you need something good luck on getting service when you want it and stuff like that. Their wait staff timing isn't great.

I had the dates, they were good. He Nutella banana sandwiches were also, but that's easy to not make bad or wrong. Good presentation on that too, warm Nutella drizzle. Powdered sugar.

But not much else was good. The duck egg rolld tasted weird. So were the pork dumpling empanadas. Had a weird sauce to them.

The shrimp ceviche was really watery and tasteless. Needed salt and a lot of it.

The firefly fries were okay. Better than the rest but there was a ton of them and they never told me about this and when I took them home, they were soggy and not as great reheated. They had shredded cheese on them and it looked like oregano on top.

It's way over hyped and I was disappointed and at $40 for just me and no alcohol, that's pretty disappointing.

Oh and they didn't charge less for any virgin mojitos, so that's a big bummer there. Being such a small restaurant that looks family owned, (they have like 3 in Vegas now) one would think they would be more accomodating. This isn't Beverly Hills you know, this is Vegas, a city based on hospitality. Not a city of elites and money where you can choose who's worth it or not."	2	Firefly	4.5
"A-OK.

For the money, the price is great and right when I went they had a $3 off with your players' card. So it was $13.99 instead of $17 So I was happy. It's good comfort food. Yes the prime rib was actually really great. And the price for Vegas is right there in the midrange but for midrance food the quality is better. Some shrimp. Respectable size, not the itty bitty kind. An okay selection at the dessert bar, gelato bar, same.

Service staff attentive and at the ready when needed. My only gripe was that I found it weird that they have plastic glasses. It just seemed cheap to me. I mean I'm not asking for stemware but geez.

Anyway, no crab legs, but it's all pretty good. Good atmosphere. Even though you have to drive a bit out there to get there. Worth a look. Maybe not a return trip, but whatevs. It's nice in there as well as the casino. And you could always find security biking around in there. A good sign."	3	Feast Buffet	3.5
"I think for a place to eat it suffices, it's not horrible, but nothing so spectacular as to write home about either.. 

It's unapologetically bland, in service, taste, and decor. I had the oxtail soup, because I was having joint pain, and the gristle is supposed to be like natural glucosamine and chrondroitin.. Anyway, I digress.. it was barely fall off the bone. Not tender, maybe I had the first of a new pot. It was a lot of work and sticky afterwards. Tired from being up all night I think most people would not be up for it. I was in for some work. Paid $10 for it too.. Maybe should have had it at the California Casino instead.. I don't recommend it unless you need to eat immediately to get back to your table or game. Maybe any of the egg combos would fare better. They made a girl an omelet of some sort while I was there. The breakfast combo I thought was a bit steep. It's not cheap, but not expensive. The days of deals in Vegas seem to be gone.."	2	Lanai Express	3

"This place is fantastic! There was a little wait in the beginning because the place was packed but nevertheless, my friend and I were seated almost right away. We both order different kinds of sushi and the sushi we liked the most ""Special Yobo Roll."" It was AMAZING! It felt like it melted on the top of your tongue. Defiantly recommend trying!

I'd highly recommend this place to anyone and will be back again very soon :-)"	5	Yama Sushi	4
"The noodle dishes are really good but the portions are a bit small. We got the Dan Dan mien and the garlic noodles -both were very flavorful. We also tried the Mongolian beef with lettuce hearts. This dish was a normal portion size but I felt like the sauce could use a little sweetness. 

The concept of the restaurant is interesting. It's not a fusion but rather Mexican and Chinese side by side as in part of the menu is Chinese and the other part is Mexican."	3	China Poblano	3.5
"I've been here about 4 times now and I feel like the quality is not as good as before. Part of my group were able to get nigiri but by the time I went to that section there was no more. I waited a few minutes and even went by a second and third time but still no nigiri. Also, sometimes the carving station is not so good. My cut of the tri tip was super tasty but the others in my group said theirs was dry. 

I would definitely still go back but I need to try wicked spoon!"	4	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"Really good at 2am after clubbing! Kinda pricey as each slice ranges from $5-7. There's also always a line at 2am but it moves at a decent speed.

"I wanted to check this place out and happy I did they where so friendly here I thought I was in another state..lol
Great food not dry and fresh cooked ( good prices)very pleased good atmosphere, clean,recommend check it out if have not.

I will be back here, you should check it out also."	5	Rocky's Bar and Grill	4
I greatly love this place wonderful food and I love the drinks all that stuff but for the price is super hard here I love them but I I can eat all I can eat Shabu or sushi for the price for just a smoothie and food there I think they should come out with combo meals one day so I can enjoy them more.	4	Greens and Proteins	4
"Review based on overall experience.
Average looking bar inside, staff kind off to busy at times, games where good winning ones not take it all, for this being a bar they went with more expensive food so if wanting simple not for you, a little more money here, and for heaven sake who ever was playing a guitar and singing was so horrible That's only reason I left awwwwww horrible.
But I would go back here as long as that guitar guy is not there. Same goes for the people I was with, they wanted out asap, lol"	3	RePete's	4

Not recommended if you want a good meal ........good for starving and gotta eat Something now place."	1	China Joy	2.5
"based on service\/food\/overall experience.
Used a groupon my friend told me about never heard of this place but gave it a shot in good standings was $27 for $40 worth, first thing I'm told to use it you gotta spend a extra $10 what????? 
and then seafood is extra $7 per person getting interesting but I was hungry after small chat with my friend we stayed to try it. mistake there...

Service was HORRIBLE had to get up myself for many things sauce\/Fork, spoons etc. Server didn't even know what name of fish they had lol.
Food was unappealing dry like not fresh, Chicken was cheap bulk with fat on it ewww, Not much to choose from either they bring you a plate for the all you can eat not good, unlike my favorite place Shabu Grill on Silverado and Maryland  you get to choose your own from fridges and wrap buffet 99% more food best place ever wish we went there, you would also A+

overall experience was very negative .....was out of a lot of food\/sauce etc, My waiter was clueless asked what fish they had got a reply I don't know ...and I heard so much of  We are OUT of it!!! t's a hole in the wall and they lie about there add so first impression was not good and didn't get better.
no wonder this place was empty. 
asked for check after while got it, and said $74 with everything tax etc that's  without Groupon!.

 We ended up paying extra $34 so with groupon  $27 I paid on groupon for $40worth.... then you gotta spent $10more to use it, then add$7person for seafood\/Was to much up selling and weird stuff added watch out.  A+ other Shabu places are cheaper and way better!
only good was they give white rice and your own hot pot not the one you share. 
At this point thou we left and ended up not far at another restaurant to finish our dinner.

this is resent and new review and I'll never go back here or my friend."	1	Swish Shabu Shabu	3.5

"Very shocked in a bad way with workers here, my first time came in gambled bartender was horrible rude since I walked in , about to quit and walk out attitude  he asked what do I want to drink very ill-mannered, I told him.... played my game and after getting so annoyed as well as a guy next to me I just wanted to leave. Cashed out and he was rude as to abruptly say to me my drink was 10bucks I yet gambled 70bucks (still scratching head here) for this place looking more nice then most ordinary  bars inside I will never ever return here very rude, pushy, impolite and demanding, horrible to try and even be nice to them here.  I do not know about there food service and would never give a chance to see there are plenty of bars very close that Welcome your company.

Maybe they should check who they hire cause I have never seen this before that bad.

"The variety of burgers and unique ingredients were very good. I really liked the duck bacon and fried egg in the Farmhouse burger. The ingredients were fresh, the buns stood out and the burger was cooked exactly to order. I do think that the burger meat itself was very bland. 

The appetizers and cocktails were exceptional. The jalapeno poppers came with an amazing sauce and the skinny screw was so refreshing."	4	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4

HORRIBLE SERVICE! Waited 20 min or so and that's because my boyfriend finally went up to someone to take our order. Which the server took forever to come to us and took forever to punch in our order!

Pretty good place. First time trying dim sum. The carts came out very fast.  Service was good &  so was the food.

I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas =)	4	Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant	3.5
I absolutely love this hole in the wall place. A couple days ago, my husband found this place for us to grab some lunch since we arrived too early to check in our hotel at the strip. We ordered the roasted pork belly and OH MY GOSH it was delicious! The texture was perfect. It was crunchy on the outside and the inside was so soft. It came with steamed rice & this sauce. The sauce was so good!! It also came with a side of soup. Although the soup was bland, I understand why. It went perfect with the meal...since the meal itself had so much flavor. We loved this place so much that we went back today before we head home. And ofcourse we ordered the same meal & we tried the pig ears...& ofcourse they didn't disappoint. It was delicious as well. We will definitely come back here if we're in town again!!!!	5	Asian BBQ & Noodle	4
My boyfriend and I tried this place because he saw it on that Anthony Bourdain show. Let me tell you, THE best Thai food hands down that I've ever had. We had the fish cake for appetizer. My boyfriend had the Northern larb (pork) & i had the roasted duck Curry..usually comes in red curry but I switched it for yellow curry. And oh my goodness...they were ALL super amazing!!! The staff was nice but could be more attentive. But nontheless...AMAZING PLACE!!!!!!	5	Lotus of Siam	4

"planned a bachlorette first night out dinner here.  the staff were very attentive even before we stepped in the door.  i had planned to have custom truffles arranged upon arrive and the staff were kind enough to oblige.  this was a perfect start to the evening.

our server was knowledgeable and happy to give recommendations wiht his favs.  i had already perused the menu and knew the steak and frites would be mine.  oh yes, and it was.  it was perfectly cooked at my desired medium rear.  most places getting it wrong, but bouchon had it right with just the right amount of bloodiness.  mmmmmm!  the bride to be also got the same and sang it's praises.  i nipped a few mussels from my friend and dunked a few frites in her broth.  that was my second choice of entree.  it was good, but i'm glad i got the steak.  few other gals got thomas keller's signature chicken and devoured it.  

we didn't get dessert.  god forbid, riiight?  i know, i know sad but we were stuffed ladies in form fitting dresses.  plus, we were ready to get our drink on.  seriously though, bouchon was great and really appreciated their help in making the evening memorable."	4	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
"came here for dinner on night two of a bachlorette party.  made reservations and seated right by the door which i was a little perturbed by.  but friends head up, the portion sizes are ginormous here.  i can eat and i barely ate half my shepard's pie.  i should have shared with my pal who had eaten about the same on her pie.  felt really bad since i couldn't exactly get a doggie bag.  

oh yes, the dirty fries are a must for a group.  greasy potato chips and some chicken liver.  what's not to love?  $2 oysters!"	3	Todd English P.U.B.	3.5
I've eaten at their Durango location and the food was great cooked perfectly. Today the food I ordered was burnt. The kalbi I ordered was perfectly cooked on one side the side that was facing up on the other side it was completely burnt. Even the teri steak was burnt and tastes bitter. Shame they would pass this off as edible.	1	Island Flavor 	4.5
"Yes, they have a high review rating on Yelp. Yes, their food is good and presentation of dishes and overall atmosphere are more on the fancy side. Yes, this place will probably always be busy with customers and continue to receive accolades. However, my one experience at this place, which was over a four-person dinner reservation on a summer Friday evening while I was in town for the weekend, was less positive than expected. Let me explain why. 

First of all, our server was rude. Not in an overt way, but rather in the manner of her being too overbearing and inconsiderate. After showing us to our table, she began explaining the menu before we all had a chance to sit down, and she even blocked my one friend from getting to her seat, so my friend ended up just going to the bathroom first. On top of that, the server then prematurely came back to take our drink\/appetizer order before my friend had returned to the table and sat down--meaning, she hadn't even had a chance to look at the menu yet! To me, this constitutes as rude practice, and that right there had set the negative tone for me. After that, the same server, on several occasions, kept reaching over me and did not allow appropriate space between herself and our table. Also, why do servers\/wait staff always want to take our plates away before we are thoroughly done with each dish??!!? On multiple occasions, our server, as well as another wait staff, had tried to reach over our table to take serving plates away, WITHOUT even asking if we were done with them....even my soup cup, which clearly had a good portion of soup left in it, was fair game to them. This is NOT okay, Arawan... Take note!!!!! This is a huge pet peeve for many of us diners, and it's annoying to me no matter the kind of establishment or how fancy the restaurant is.

Although we were satisfied with the food that we ordered, it's highly likely that I, personally speaking, will never return. It's a shame too, because there were quite a few dishes that I would have liked to try. But aside from the less-than-quality service that I experienced, it should also be noted that their prices are more on the expensive end of Thai cuisine. I feel that these combined reasons justify my low rating here. For me, the poor service experience trumped the food, and especially at those prices. Why would I pay more money for really the same quality of food that I can get elsewhere and with better service?"	2	Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert	4.5
"Location is close to work, so been here a couple of times, for both dine-in and drive-thru.  Service is good.  Food quality is good.  Nothing wrong with my orders so far.  Happy with this location and would go again, as long as I'm in the mood for their fast food.

Since trying their iced coffees, I like them better than McDonald's...they are sweeter and have better flavor!"	3	Burger King	2.5
"Still one of my go-to spots for boba... Whenever I'm in the mood for my favorite coffee milk tea of theirs, I will usually make a stop before heading home.  It's nice and convenient since the location is prime, just being down the street and a quick drive from where I live.  During summers I frequent there a lot, in-and-out each visit with my to-go drink (and the occasional snack) in hand.

HOWEVER... I have dropped my rating for them by one star from my previous review.  Why?  For one reason only: Because of their new ""large"" size cold drink cup.....which is more like a bowl, instead of a cup.  If you have small hands, it's not the ideal size, unless you intend on holding your drink with two hands.  Good thing for me, I usually take my drink home, with no intention of carrying it around with me while I shop, or what not.  But even so, this new large-sized to-go cup\/bowl does NOT even fit in your standard car CUP-HOLDER!  So WTH is the point in that??!!?

It works fine if you don't have a front-seat passenger, because the cup\/bowl is seriously BIG ENOUGH to be placed on the passenger seat with the seat belt on!"	4	Easy Life Boba Tea	4
"I work in the medical field and once a week on Wednesdays I work at the medical building attached to Centennial Hills Hospital... So, almost every Wednesday I am able to get breakfast before cases start with the doctors who I work for.

I like because:

1- It's a convenient walk through a hallway connecting our building with the hospital & cafeteria.

2- We get a discount off the already inexpensive food that they offer.

3- I don't frequent hospital cafeterias often, but I think that their food is relatively good, particularly their breakfast.....which includes the following:  Buffet-style BISCUITS & GRAVY (my personal favorite item on their morning menu), HASH BROWNS, BACON, SAUSAGE, FRENCH TOAST, & SCRAMBLED EGGS, along with eggs made to order.

4- Service is nice...(you can usually see the same little, older lady at the cash register).  Just this morning, the guy who checked me out said, ""We have a policy here at the cafe... We expect everyone who comes through to SMILE.""  =)


Oh, and FREE COFFEE all day...complete with a selection of creamers and sweeteners!"	4	Centennial Hills Hospital Cafeteria	4.5
"I USED TO love this place.  I USED TO enjoy coming here and even have to wait for a table to open up.  The service USED TO be better!!!  However, my friends and I have noticed a BIG decline in their service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The servers (mainly women) ""pretend"" to NOT understand what you say or ask for.  I think it is ridiculous that after you have been seated, you have to wait more than 15 minutes before someone even comes up to your table to take your drink order, much less your food order...which we always already know what we want to order since we have been regulars here for a long time now and always take guests from out-of-town for the food.  Don't get me wrong, the food is still great, which is the only reason that I still come.  But food quality and busyness of the establishment IS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR BAD SERVICE!!!!!!!  This review is clearly all over the place, but I am extremely angered and disappointed about my experience here with a friend last night, because we came specifically for the food, which we were craving!!!!!  But what did we get, BAD SERVICE again!!!

First of all, after we were seated, we made several attempts to try to get a server's attention (and even the guy at the front who looked like he was in charge of seating people, and also the same guy who made eye contact with my friend who was trying to motion him that we were ready to order but just seemed to ignore us for the next 10 minutes).  Finally, we got the attention of a server to let her know that we were ready to order, so she went and got another server to take our order, who then never came back to check on us the rest of the night.  Their wait staff just seems so disorganized, because different girls kept walking by and our food was brought out to us by various girls.  We ordered our food all at once because we knew it would take a long time to get a second order in if we wanted.  Our food came, some items before others; so we ate, pretty much taking our time and enjoying our food, during which time no one came up to ask if we needed anything or to refill our waters or my hot tea.......but instead, three times three different servers did come up to take a bowl that was pretty much empty but had more sauce in it which we were still working on, but without asking if we were done with it and just trying to take it off our table.  I mean, JUST ASK FIRST if we are done before taking plates away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SO ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then, we still had two more dishes that we were waiting for, which my friend had asked two servers to please check on the remainder of our order.  But I don't think they even did.  Because when we were almost done with our meal and pretty much full, we still hadn't gotten our last two dishes.  So, my friend asked another server to cancel our orders of the tempura and butterfish (which the girl said, ""ok let me check""....but we countered and said, ""can you just please cancel the orders because he have been waiting for it and we are almost done eating here"").....but she still went to go check on the order (which again, we had asked them two times prior to check on while we were mid-way thru our meal)......then immediately, she came back with both dishes.  My response to her was ""oh, how convenient that when we are almost done and ask to cancel our order, you bring it out right away""....she just smiled and shrugged.  OBVIOUSLY, they hadn't forgotten about our order, because she brought them out too quickly, which made us believe that our food had been done and it was simply due to the sloppy service and inattentiveness that they brought the rest of our order to us that late......much less why my friend's shrimp tempura was already soggy when she got it!  INEXCUSABLE SERVICE, which is why we didn't feel the least bit sorry when we decided to leave a tip of less than 10% of the bill.

I MEAN REALLY....... I totally get that you guys are always busy.  But you should already be used to it and train your employees better, as far as being more organized and ready for such a rush.  Also, with that many people on staff (I'm thinking there were at least six servers last night, which if you think about how small the place is, should be enough to cover the tables and provide better service and attention to your customers), no one should experience such CRAPPY SERVICE!!!!!!  

I now come for the food alone and NEVER WILL I EXPECT GOOD SERVICE FROM ICHIZA'S.......which overall should make for a bad review!

Places like this, who really have a huge following and whose food is exceptional and worthy of coming back to, should be ashamed when they don't deliver in quality of service....and even more so when their SERVICE SUCKS OVERALL!!!!!!!"	2	Ichiza	4
"While driving down Rainbow one day, my sister and I saw this place and the name itself cracked us up.  As a friend pointed out later, it sounds like ""Jenni-fer"" haha!.  So, one Sunday after feeling sick the night before and craving soup that morning, my sister and I were driving by again and decided to stop for pho.

CASH ONLY.  (But they do have an ATM machine, if you don't mind the fee.)  Service was a bit slow, but the guy who welcomed us in and served us was friendly, plus he was even in costume since it was Halloween morning.

We each order our own pho bowls and boba drinks.  The boba was not that great, tasted watered-down and nothing special.  Save your $3 and make the trip to Chinatown area for the good stuff.

As for the pho, I thought it was good...the broth was tasty, the noodles were just right, and the portion of meats was satisfying.  I had the ""Jenni Pho"" house combo, so it was a mix of stuff.  Considering that I'm not really a big fan of pho to begin with, I was happy with what I had at this place.  I give it up to Jennifer (according to the menu, that's really the owner's name) and would definitely go back if I was having another craving for pho!"	3	Jenni Pho	3
"After writing my first review of this place, I originally gave them a 4.  I was raving about their pad thai, which I had a couple of weeks ago while dining in, and then had a craving for it.  So, the other night, my friend and I ordered food to go... Which is why I ended up dropped that first review down to a 3-stars.....

When I called in the order, the guy who answered seemed short on the phone, and after I got off the phone with him, I had a feeling that he didn't get my order right (a simple pad thai with tofu AND an order of beef satay).  So I asked my friend to double-check the order when he was picking it up...and yes, our order was incorrect.  Apparently, the guy missed the second item, so my friend had to order it then and ended up having to wait the extra time.  And even then, they ended up giving us chicken satay instead of the beed satay that we wanted.

Maybe it was a different cook OR simply because he had our food to go, but the quality of the food was not the same as when I first had it just three weeks before... The pad thai was not as tasty, it was on the salty side, and the noodles were not as moist and sticky as I had described them in my first review.  As for the satay, the chicken was dry and the peanut sauce did not look good at all... In fact, it was too thick (just not the same consistency as other, normal peanut sauces out there), and it just looked old and the color too dark (as if it was not freshly made that day and had been microwaved over and over again).

This take-out experience turned me off, as I don't think I will be returning for their food...especially when there are a lot of other thai restaurants out there who can offer better quality and better service.  Trust me, I've frequented other places, for both dine-in and take-out, and I've never had this problem of inconsistency before.  And this is why I have dropped my rating of ""King & I"" down to a 2...because I have DEFINITELY had better."	2	King & I	4
Fantastic steaks.  Order it blue if you like it rare.  My only regret after going 4 times was not having dessert...I was too full!	5	N9NE Steakhouse	4
"I took my parents from Japan while they were here.  We wanted to send almost EVERYTHING back.  This place is a big EEWWW!!!  This is the first time I left AYCE sushi restaurant hungry and the first time I didn't finish my favorite Amaebi.
My recommendation is not to get sushi, not to get miso soup, not to get green tea.  What should you get?  Mochi ice cream!
The service was good though."	1	Jjanga Japanese Restaurant	4
"I just went to their pre-opening and I loved it!
I can't wait to take my husband because I know he will love it, too!

Their curry  reminds me of  a famous Japanese curry chain called CoCo Ichiban, which is my favorite curry restaurant in Japan.

I had chicken katsu (chicken cutlet) curry, which was always my favorite at CoCo.  Their secret curry sauce is prepared from scratch, and I was so impressed that theirs was as good as CoCo's! I had been missing this so much!

Along with basic curry,  you can add toppings of your choice from chicken cutlet, pork cutlet, deep fried shrimp, croquette, yakiniku beef, sausage and more. I always like chicken katsu on my curry, but other people were saying pork katsu was good, too. I think the spice level is about 4 out of 10, not too spicy, not too mild, but you can add more spice if you like.

The price was reasonable. Curry with 1 or 2 toppings(which I think is enough), is less than $10. Sometimes Japanese portions are too small, but theirs was big enough and I felt very satisfied after the meal. 

If you're missing real Japanese curry, or if you 're disappointed with others, this is the one you should try!"	5	Japanese Curry Zen	4.5
"I was staying at Mandalay Bay with some girlfriends and we decided to try this place for dinner on a Saturday night. We didn't have a reservation but we got seated right away. The atmosphere was elegant and sophisticated, but the staff was really friendly and helpful. 

Drinks: They have an enormous and extravagant wine and champagne list here if you're looking to splurge. Most are by the bottle but they have a nice selection by the glass, too. My friends and I ordered cocktails though. I had the raspberry lemon drop which was super tasty and not too strong. My friend got some cherry martini which was super strong but still tasted pretty good.

Food: My friend and I split the pizza with sausage and rapini (Italian style broccoli). It was delicious! And splitting it was perfect because we didn't want to be too full for dancing and drinking later in the evening. My other friend got the calf liver...don't ask me why...she was not a huge fan...

Overall I would definitely recommend Lupo if you are looking for good food and a reasonable price (considering you are in Las Vegas!!!), however I don't feel the need to return next time I visit Vegas."	4	Lupo by Wolfgang Puck	3.5
We took a group of friends that come to Vegas often but had never been to Glutton. Every single one in our group said that they would come back here in a heartbeat. Try the burger...honestly one of the best burgers you will ever taste. But to only talk about the burger would be a complete disservice to the rest of their amazing food. Everything was great, the service was "spot on" and prices were reasonable.	5	Glutton	4.5
If you go here with friends do yourself a favour and start off by sharing all their "street food" selections before ordering other stuff. I've been here several time and everything on the menu has been fantastic.	5	Origin India Las Vegas	3.5
Great service, great drinks but the food is the star. Try the burnt ends and bacon jam. The watermelon salad was an awesome share plate to finish off our great experience.	5	Carson Kitchen	4.5
Oh boy! Awesome food. You have to try the mutton curry, it's simply awesome and the garlic naan melts in your mouth!	5	Angara Indian Spice Grill	4.5
Food was really good, but I feel this place has no identity I was confused has Asian, Mexican and Italian like I said food is really good really tasty service could use some help.	3	Pier 215	4.5
A friend of mine told me we had to hit the spot definitely glad I listen to him the dogs are amazing chili cheese fries just as good. It's a definite must hit if you're on the south end of town service is good too.	5	Dirt Dog	4.5
Wow piss poor service. My wife wanted to sit outside so we asked to and they took us outside they had one table that was dirty so we were told to go back to the host stand and wait 5 to 6 minutes as we waited One of the servers moved one of her guest to the table we were waiting for. I went back to the host stand said that we have been waiting for that table that they just gave to somebody else. The server that was standing at the host stand at that moment gave me dirty looks like I was a moron. The host went out there talk to the table for a few seconds and came back out to me and told me we don't have a table for you. I was asking for an exclamation of why they had no table for me the server got an extreme attitude and started to smart off so I asked him for the manager. The manager was no help I feel like he was just patronizing me "oh my how does that happen" what a complete joke and on top of all that I had to waste $10 for parking	1	Hard Rock Cafe	3.5
I literally haven't been here in 10 years, they did change a lot of things I was disappointed they don't have the meatballs and garlic pizza anymore, but I got a pepperoni sausage pizza and some hot wings. let me tell you the hot wings were amazing pizza was great services really good their fries were the exact same as red Robin but way better nice and crispy. nice place to come to if you want that down home Chicago hometown bar. I will definitely return	5	Brando's Sportsbar	4
Love this bar. Foods good, service is amazing Kristine always waits on me and she's the best. Always sweet and makes sure I have everything thing I need and more. So glad they finally open this location i used to always go to Timbers which is an OK place but this is now my bar.	5	PT's Gold	3.5
The food is good, one of the best Hawaiian places in town. Love the salad bar with the macaroni salad. The service in my opinion is not the greatest. They threw our food at us threw our check and really didn't come back until we flag them down. I will return because the food and price is worth it.	4	Market Street Cafe	3.5
A good friend of mine ate here yesterday for the first time and he had to show me this place today. "It's that good" Amazing food had the stuffed peppers, get there early if you want to get them because once they're out there out. And they do run out of stuff peppers every day. service was good nice and friendly. I'll probably be back here Saturday with my wife.	5	Sonio's Cafe	4
Been wanting to try this place for a long time. Stopped in yesterday and omg it was well worth it the food was amazing and the Service and people there were too so friendly and happy to help. If you're ever in town to get a chance to stop bye do it.	5	Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern	4
Excellent food and service.  Portions can easily be shared.  If you like corned beef hash, this is the place!  This store is their only one off the Strip, so it had a slower pace than I would assume of the Strip locations.	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
"Way to go Trevi! I'm a total Italian food snob and the last place I thought we'd find anything half-decent on the Strip was in the middle of the Forum Shops. Alas, the Chicken Francese I had here was the best ever! It was so fresh, and so tasty I took my time on it. It was probably the first time my wife ever finished her food before I did. So frikkin' good.

It's also worth noting our entrees made it to the table like lightning. I was floored. I had only eaten one piece of bread prior. I'm always suspicious when that happens, but like I said, this food was very good. And finally, we had the triple Gelato for dessert. I'm a Gelato snob as much as I'm an Italian food snob, which figures since they pretty much go hand-in-hand. In fact, it was the Gelato counter that made our decision. If we can have a nice dinner next to that beautiful fountain under the fake sky with Gelato for the win, I call that a good day. 

I also really appreciated the manager-type who came over to the table to check up on things. What a fun dude and great conversationalist. Seeing that helps explain why we had exceptional service and food. Hey - don't ever take it for granted. Some Vegas places are just happy to take your money and boot your pants."	5	Trevi	3.5
"I'm not one for gimmicks, and I tend to avoid the Planet Hollywood hotel at all costs whenever I'm in town. It's not really the casino itself - it's just ... I try to keep my distance from Britney Spears in any medium, and that building-sized banner of her certainly qualifies. Wait a minute! THAT explains why the Miracle Mile Mall smells like bus stop and failure! Mystery solved!

Still, as fate would have it, we found ourselves meat-hungry and within sight of Gordon Ramsay's Burgr. Man, that just sounds so dirty. Well, at least it isn't Britney's Burgr. ::Gasp::

Anyway, I quickly scanned the reviews and many had mentioned the ridiculous standard wait times to get seated. Well, there was almost no line at the time, so we hopped in. I'm glad we did, because this place was great.

Is it overpriced? Yes. It's Vegas - get over it. Does it do burgers and pretty much only burgers? Yes. And as the rule stands, if that's all you do, it better be outstanding. And it is. I'm happy to say it is. The best thing about the burgers here is the BUN. Stay with me. Too many burger joints make the mistake of garlic buttering and toasting the bun, making the burger appear more substantial but all but ruining the actually eating process. Plus, I'm paying for the burger, not the bun. At Burgr, the bun is exceptionally light. It's like eating air. It holds the accoutrements in place and keeps down the mess but enables an easier bite. This is an extremely functional - and tasty - burger, and one of the best I have had in a long time."	4	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
"The western U.S. wrote the book on terrible pizza, but Pizza Rock is an exception to that rule. The overall dining experience here is 5 stars - especially in comparison to other Las Vegas ""pizza"" locations. But there are a few issues keeping this place from truly rocking it, as it were.

Most importantly, Pizza Rock's menu needs serious help. Someone at this restaurant needs to understand the menu, as presented, is way out of bounds when it comes to pizza menus. With pretty much any real pizza joint, you typically have your crust options followed by your topping options, and a few ""specialty"" pies, and that's it. Short, sweet, simple.

Pizza Rock, in an effort to break the mold (which I always encourage) prints a large and very clunky menu that takes forEVER to read. Although it is loosely broken down by pizza styles, each pizza (and there are MANY) has its own custom toppings. Between the styles, names, awards, and ingredients, it is a daunting read. It's like hey you can get this Italian pizza with 12 cheeses, a half pineapple and five rabbits' feet or this next pizza that won the South Central Tracey Bonham award in 1998 and it comes with four butchered gnomes and an upside-down piano on it. 

The point is, ASK THE SERVER. I was so sick of reading I just requested whatever Pizza Rock's version of a large New York style pizza where it goes crust, tomato sauce, then cheese. And, wouldn't you know it, the pizza tasted great!

The other issue is the restrooms. Terrible! No water pressure, no paper towels, AND you had to pull the door inward to leave (which means touching the handle everyone else who didn't not have water or paper towels just touched, and dreading picking up your next slice of pizza.

Pizza places MUST have clean bathrooms. The fact that so many reviewers don't seem to mind really gives you an idea of Yelp's demographic."	4	Pizza Rock	4
"This container park is a welcome addition to a really previously junky part of town. Actually, the case can be made it's still a bit neglected up here, but this innovation is a good start. Locals will be quick to tell you this project was made possible by Zappo's, and that's cool, but it's also moot. The point is it's just nice to see the downtown springing back to life!

The container recycling concept is really catching on. I've seen containers used to build seaside condos, but this is the first time I've seen them used in this little outdoor mall\/entertainment center format. The centerpiece here (and this will surprise some of you downtown Vegas purists) is actually a playground right smack in the middle, where dozens of screaming kids run wild. The whole park is very much family centric, and if you're in the downtown to party, this is not your place.

Otherwise, if the Griswalds need a break from the Old Strip, you'd do worse than to bring them here."	3	Downtown Container Park	4
"My absolute favorite non-buffet breakfast option on the Strip. This is also my favorite of three Mon Ami Gabi locations we've visited, and it's pretty much the Vegas factor that wins out.

You are going to pay more to eat breakfast here than at a buffet - this is true. But this food is memorable. I highly recommend anything Bananas Foster. Doesn't matter if you get the waffles or pancakes, but, I guaranty these are the lightest, crispiest, tastiest waffles you'll ever eat if you so choose. 

Also, and this is the most important part - the coffee here is beyond reproach. It is so good, I had the server write down the Web site for me so I could order a couple bags. I'm typically not a French roast guy, but this coffee is all kinds of special.

Of note - outside dining is walk-up only. Get there early and spend a little time waiting in the casino if you want the beautiful terrace seating. If you want a reservation, you can call, but that's going to get you inside tables only."	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"Solid buffet. Not a top tier but it isn't trying to be. Pay attention to which line you're in, because if you're a card holder or MyVegas player, there's a different line for you. The other people waiting will simply stand in the main line because they think they should, even though they can go to the much shorter, quicker line because they have the card.

Best surprise at this buffet was the yogurt bar, and the other was probably the coffee. The coffee was way better than it needed to be. Bold, smooth, fresh. This buffet is a really good value."	3	The Buffet at Luxor	2.5
"Get the steak. It's epic.

Food was uniformly fine (""fine"" as in outstanding and rarified). Gorgeous, elegant interior. Overstaffed, which is a breath of fresh air. 

Will return."	5	Fleur by Hubert Keller	4
Great comedy. Mac and cheese is probably the best I've ever had. BBQ is always top notch. Bar tender Ali is amazing.	5	Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern	4
Ehh. I had high hopes because of the reviews - service was excellent, but quality of the sushi was not that good (had philly, spicy tuna, and tempora rolls). Moderately priced - spicy tuna and salmon tasted a little funky.	2	Sakana	4
I found this place on Instagram and thought I would give it a try...I ordered the "patty melt" which was really tasty!! I also ordered a side of the street corn which I wasn't really a huge fan of because the portion was very small for $3!  Overall, the food was good and the staff were friendly!	4	The Goodwich	4.5
I found this place on Groupon and decided to try it. I ordered the shrimp, crab, and lobster and my husband had the shrimp with rice. The broth has a nice kick to it, not too spicy just enough satisfy that craving...I had to request salt and pepper though because the broth was a little bland besides the spicy taste. Overall, the food and service were good!! I would recommend this place if you like seafood.	4	Killer Shrimp	3.5
I newly discovered this place via Groupon and decided why not try it? Let me say I couldn't have made a better decision...the ambiance of this place is EXCELLENT!!! My husband and I went on a Friday night around 8pm and surprisingly there was no wait but still a little busy. The service and food were both great but the highlight of the night was the drink I ordered (Passionate about Jameson)....its a real winner in my book!	5	Sedona Lounge	3.5
This is in my top 3 BBQ places ever. We had the smoked meatloaf, ribs, pork, and brisket. All of it was amazing. We had the Mac n cheese side and corn nuggets both great. We had two different sauces the arkansasauce and the country sauce. We preferred the country and it was excellent on the ribs. Finished dinner off with peach cobbler	5	Rollin Smoke Barbeque	4.5
This place was fantastic!! The food was great the triple fries were great, the wings were great, the mac n cheese burger was just awesome! We enjoyed it!	5	Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar	3.5
Best Thai food I have ever had. The northern dishes are great. The pad Thai noodles were great. The appetizers were great.	5	Lotus of Siam	4
Was surprised to not hate this place. Had the seafood stack (on ice) - the fresh quality of the sea creatures spoke for itself. Appetizers and desserts were fun. I can corroborate the first review in that they're very accommodating of large groups. Decor is nothing special for Vegas but such comes to be a relief after a while. Service was up to snuff. Not inexpensive but not inappropriately priced either.	4	Stack Restaurant & Bar	4
Stayed in the Mandalay for several days and had breakfast here twice out of convenience. Acceptable morning food and coffee. Portions are generous. Unnoteworthy decor. Speedy service.	3	Red, White & Blue Restaurant	2.5
Slid in just for coffee and dessert, so consider this review specialized. The entire staff had to have a conference as to whether it was acceptable for us to skip directly to the final course. We started out with the cheeses accompanied by honeycomb and apple slices: top-notch. A tad disappointed by the brownies and doughnuts, which isn't to say that we abandoned anything on our plates. Prices were not appalling. The set-up is quite beautiful in a conservative sort of way. Will return for a proper meal.	4	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
The scenery is peerless, neon-laced '70s kitsch. My enormo tomato-hollandaise chicken omelet didn't live up to its promise and the hash-browns were strangely subpar. Coffee: decent. Our waitress was stoned and the prices were a bit high too. Still, the convenience- (nice to be able to park right next to a decent eats on the strip) and cheese-factor make this a Vegas must.	4	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
"this place is been here long before many health food stores  but for some reason some prices are out of control .. why buy anything here when you can get them cheaper somewhere else ..

From the menu, it seemed that many of the steaks were not even premium-priced but very overpriced.  The steak I ordered was okay, they overcooked it from the medium rare I ordered.   The one thing I enjoyed was the mashed potatoes they served as a side.  Service was okay at best.  If you are going here , make sure you make a reservatoin.	2	Jean Georges Steakhouse	3.5
Dim sum\/pot stickers were okay and spicy thai noodles (chicken) seemed a little bland, even though we asked for it spicy. Enjoyed the pork buns.	2	Noodles	3
Good selection and variety for a seafood buffet.	3	Todai Restaurant	3.5
Great grilled options...Lambchops were amazing, and this place has a dessert paradise on the buffet selection!  Love the gelatos!!  Service was impeccable for a buffet!	4	The Buffet	3.5
Enjoyed the baked rigatoni and mozarella garlic bread we ordered.  It was more than we could eat, and they didnt have cheaper options for 2 people.  Its not like you would pack anything to go anyways, being in Vegas.	3	Buca Di Beppo	3.5
I was looking for something open late at night around 11:30 and this was one of the only places open that looked decent.  I ordered the burger here which was a little hard to eat because it was messy the way they made it, but it was good.  The shake here was average.	2	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4
Come on bobby! Im a huge fan of the guy, but this place came in subpar.  Nothing mind blowing here, just super priced food and the bobby flay stamp of approval. My steak was okay and overcooked for a medium rare.	2	Mesa Grill	4
Best buffet experience in vegas!! Loved everything we tried! From soup to desserts!  Omelette made to order was great, so was all the meat selections! They have portions set out in little small pans which were cool and easy to eat.	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"Great authentic Japanese restaurant. Came here with a party of 6 for a dinner reservation at 6PM. Be prepared to spend a minimum of 2 hours here at the restaurant.

I highly recommend doing the course meal. Every dish was perfection.

On an odd note, the bathroom has a forest theme with a tree in there. Really quite pretty."	4	Raku	4.5
"If you're looking for a quiet place to have dinner and to hold a conversation with your dinner partner, do not go here.

Like any restaurant in Vegas, probably best to make reservations to avoid a wait. However, there is first come first serve seating at the bar with full menu for those of you that have to eat and run.

Ordered the chilled shrimp cocktail to start. The shrimp is still it's in its shell and won't be served in a glass. The shrimp were actually quite delicious and very meaty. The cocktail sauce was decent. Was it the best shrimp cocktail I've ever had? No. Was it better than the average shrimp cocktail. Yes. If you do decide to go to Postrio despite my review you can be assured the shrimp cocktail is not the reason why I gave Postrio two stars.

My main entree was the capellini pasta with grilled shrimp, calamari and spicy tomato sauce. You may notice that the menu actually includes mussels as well, but there were no mussels present in my serving. Also the capellini seemed overcooked and mushy. This was a huge disappointment. I can expect sub par pasta from a restaurant that doesn't specialize in Italian cuisine, but considering this is an Italian restaurant and a Wolfgang Puck restaurant no less, I was extremely disappointed.

Undoubtedly you can find a better Italian restaurant on the strip otherwise you're up for a huge disappointment at Postrio."	2	Postrio	3.5
"Is it overpriced? Yes.  Is it the best Chinese food I've had? No.  BUT it is the best Chinese food on the strip in Las Vegas and hence the generous 4 stars on Yelp.

Noodle Asia has always hit the spot when I'm in Las Vegas and craving Chinese food.  I only wish they would open a tad bit later to let me wander in drunk fulfilling the craving for a hot bowl of won ton noodle soup.  For those thinking the high review is because of eating under influence that is not true.  I've been here drunk, sober, and hung over and all three circumstances Asia Noodle has always been good to me.  I even try to stay inside the Venetian or Palazzo just so I don't have to go outside and face the elements to get to my beloved Asia Noodle.

Won Ton Noodle Soup (with and without BBQ pork), Night Market Fried Rice, Hot and Sour Soup, and the BBQ Combination Plate are my standard fare here.

On a side note, Asia Noodle recently got a facelift and looks a lot fancier than it did before.  For you sports fan nuts out there, they even have bar seating that faces the Cantor's sports book so you don't have to unglue your eyes from the game while eating."	4	Noodle Asia	3.5
The changes are so obvious. Customer service is better. Product is getting better. Had the boneless wings tonight. They were super good. It's just as easy to praise as it is to criticize. My granny used to say that. Good job.	3	Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen	1.5
2 stars for having a nice manager on duty and staff. But your wings suck out loud. Who wants to eat a bunch of flats with that tacky little tip on it.	2	Nevada Chicken Cafe	3.5
I did delivery today and it was so good. I went back and forth on what to order. Everything sounded so good. I tried the hummus, Mediterranean salad w\/salmon, and the chicken shawarma. The fries were unbelievable!!! The hummus was great. Everything was soooo good. Delivery guy was nice. Menu is a keeper!!!	4	Maza Mediterranean Grill & Lounge	4
I went to a function last night and needed a quick dish to take. I never knew this place was here but WOW!!! The manager Tony introduced me to cachapa. Its corn and cheese grilled and glazed. Sooo good and what a hit it was on the buffet. The place is tucked away in a corner but don't miss it. I am going back very soon. Super friendly staff.	5	Viva Las Arepas	4.5
Omg...so good. Third time here. Today I got a gyro. Yesterday I got wings and loved them!!! My coworker got them today. On top of fabulous food, the nicest people! Like Cheers but food.	5	Windy City Beefs N Dogs	4.5
Went around 11:30 this morning. We weren't greeted either but the staff was really nice once we were seated. Horrible coffee. My wings were greasy. The waffles were good. I like the other location much better.	3	M&M Soul Food Cafe	4
Yummy! Super nice staff. Sandwich is awesome. Better then Jimmy Johns...love the ordering process. Will definitely be back.	4	Which Wich Superior Sandwiches	3.5
Did takeout yesterday. Just a basic breakfast. Crispiest non-greasy potatoes with fresh scallions. Yummy bacon. Perfectly scrambled eggs, and a very large biscuit from heaven. Order taken with enthusiasm and pride. When I picked up, nice staff. If the basic was this stellar, I can only imagine what the rest of the menu has to offer. Definitely returning.	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
Nice customer service when ordering last night. They even put a fried oreo in for gp! I didn't get a burger but someone else did and loved it.	3	Tony Marcs 420 Eats	4
Been coming here since it opened and there hasn't been anything on the menu that doesn't satisfy my tastebuds! The guys here are always really nice and make sure we are satisfied. Best acai bowls in Vegas!	5	Juice 'N' Go	4.5
First of all they have vegan options! The food is very tasty and my taste buds are more than satisfied!	5	J. Gumbo's	3.5

Really clean, nice people, and the vegan pho was great! My new favorite pho place for sure! :-)	5	Pho Vietnam Grille Express	4.5
"This is a pretty cool bar I would say. They have life-sized board games like jenga, chess\/checkers, cornhole, connect four, and these giant beer pong things. They also have pool tables and firebird outside and this random large bed. It's a really nice place to chill with a group of friends I would say. 

I came here on a Sunday night around 8 and it didn't start to get busy around 10 but I didn't stay around too long to fully know how it gets later on. The drinks at the bar are I guess ""fairly priced"" it's just they skimp on the alcohol on drinks which is pretty lame. They also have a place to order food inside called, Grill or something. I only tried their herb fries and mozzarella sticks and it was pretty good but nothing special about them. 

I guess overall it's a pretty neat place and I'd definitely come back again with more friends to enjoy it with."	3	Gold Spike	4
People seemed to go crazy for the creme brulee donut but it's alright tbh. I was also excited for the flavors I was hoping would be good like red velvet and strawberry cream cheese and it was also just alright. However, the oh my birthday cake oreo donut was delicious! That one by far is my favorite. I would probably only come back just for that.	3	Donut Bar	4.5
This place was alright to me. Not the best ramen but not the worst either. I've had better but this could work if you need a quick fix on a budget.	2	Monta Ramen	4
This is one of the boba places I would enjoy and see myself going most of the time. I just wish it wasn't so far from Nellis AFB. I really like their taro milk tea and what's cool about it is that they have a level of sweetness and if you're not sure how sweet you want it, just get regular or less and if you want it more sweeter they'll happily change it for you. Though, I must admit their boba was a little undercooked but I personally didn't mind. Service was also friendly. I look forward to coming back here soon :)	3	Kung Fu Tea	4.5
I've been wanting to try eggslut for the longest time now and when I found out they had one in Vegas, I jumped on the first opportunity I got. I came here on the second day since they opened so of course there would be a long line. Totally understandable. I would say it took us about a little over an hour from first arriving at the end of the line to finally getting our food. Was the line worth it? Was it worth the wait? Was it worth the hype? No. No. No. It wasn't worth anything. I honestly felt like it wasn't anything spectacular. It was pretty much basic. For two people, I paid 43 bux for 2 damn sandwiches, 2 drinks, and a biscuit. And to find out that it all wasn't even all that great. Like seriously? You're better off going somewhere else to be honest. And I think the most annoying part is that I was still hungry! I still can't believe I paid that much over nothing. I don't know if this is just Vegas but I hear the one in LA is different but I wouldn't even risk going back again. Overall everything is just one giant nope for me.	2	Eggslut	4
When I first came to Vegas, my husband's supervisor recommended this place and it was perfect because I was craving some chili cheese dog. I really like this place. They make one mean dog. I just wish it didn't fall apart so easy.	4	Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dogs	4.5
This is the sushi spot I go to when I'm craving sushi.. Which is almost 80% of the time. I usually opt for the bar because we don't have to wait to get seated and plus because the drinks are over there. Sushi here is great and staff are nice and friendly. My only complaint is that they don't have a lion king roll! Lion King roll is my absolute favorite roll. That was practically all I would ever get when I lived in California. But ever since I moved to Vegas, a lot of sushi places don't carry it. And when I asked them if they had a lion king roll the bartender told me they removed it from the menu. Super sad face! But other than that, sushi is good, service is good, and drinks are good!	4	Kabuki Japanese Restaurant	4
"I remember seeing this place on the Food Network and thought it would be pretty cool to go there. When I actually finally got to try it, I was disappointed. 

When you first go in, they put you in a scrub and it's mandatory. It was a little annoying because I had layers on because it was like 40 degrees outside and adding the scrub on top of my clothes was going to be restricting when I eat. I didn't even want to take my jacket off because I'd still be freezing. Plus it's a little annoying in general because it's so tedious and all you really wanna do is eat. 

Let me remind you that this is a themed restaurant. A medical\/ hospital themed where the employees have a nurse uniform and a doctor uniform. And the setting of the place was new and interesting which is why gave it 2 stars. This place is more of an experience than it's food. 

Now the food.. The food was bland. Bland. Bland. It was not that great. I've had better burgers than that. The onion rings were the only flavorful thing they had. Though I did like their mango dreamsicle. They are pretty strict with their menu but the way it was setup was cool. You can't have this, you can't have that, we don't have this, we don't have that. Like my aunt asked for hot water because it helps with her stomach and our server was like, ""Nope! We have this water bottle."" I don't really know. I felt like our server was kinda rude anyways. I feel like the people work there think there think they're hot shit but I mean whatever I guess. Oh yeah. If you don't finish your food, you get spanked.

Overall experience was okay. Ambiance was the only thing that gave this rating 2 stars. Like I said, food was bland. Workers were kinda annoying. And it's cash only. I felt like they did too much with this concept. It's not as great as it seems to be. I personally wouldn't want to eat here again unless I have people out of town coming here that wants to try it."	2	Heart Attack Grill	3
I would say this place has one of the better boba places I've tried in Vegas. They have a pretty good selection of milk teas and slushies and they have shaved ice! It's like a Tapioca Express but better because I actually like this place and I hate TapEx.	2	Icy Juicy	3
I stumbled upon this place when I was near the neighborhood and it was a perfect timing because I was craving for some French macarons. It's a really cute place with great service. The girl was so easy to talk to and her service was impeccable. I decided to eat here to try it out and since because I haven't ate yet. It's pretty much like a cafe. They have breakfast and lunch items, sandwiches and burgers, and soups and salads. On the dessert side they have cakes, pastries, gelato, and the French macarons. We ordered the honey 1\/2 pound black angus sirloin burger and turkey pesto sandwich. Their food is pretty good. My only complaint about my food was that I wish there was more of that pesto spread so it had a little bit more flavor. But over all the food was delish. Oh, and their macarons are really yummy too AND cheap! So I'm definitely coming back here for more of that and to try the rest of their food.	4	Honey Cakes Cafe	3.5
Favorite pizza place! Their sicilian and white sauce pizza is so good!! A little pricey but totally worth your money. We had a little trouble finding it but it's on the third floor at the cosmopolitan.	4	Secret Pizza	4
My brother recommend this place when he was in Vegas for his friend's wedding. He told me how much he love their chicken wings. So I gave this place a chance to see what's it about. It's pretty much like an Asian fusion place or more of a Korean spot. They have karaoke private stations in the back and a bar. When we went there it was really dead. We were their only customers. But the ambiance is cool. We ordered some fried pork cutlets, Korean bbq, sweet potato fries, shrimp tempura, watermelon soju, and of course their wings since it's the most popular there. But I've had better and cheaper of all of those food. Now, let's talk about their wings. They have I think 3 different flavors for the wings and we tried them all. The wings are chunky pieces. It's not like wingstop or buffalo wild wings size wings. But as far as taste goes, it's alright. Didn't really like it actually.. And as far as the service\/staff, they were really nice and on point. But I'm not sure if that's really how it went down or if it's because they didn't have any other customers to pay attention to but us. I don't think I'd ever come back here unless I decide to give this place one more chance but I don't think I will.	2	Bazic Bar & Restoyaky	3.5
I've heard a lot of people talk highly about this place and was really excited when I finally got to go here but it was a big disappointment. The food was okay. The only thing I really enjoyed was the ribeye. And I didn't like the fact the steamed egg was $5. I will admit the price from 10-2am is cheap but there wasn't much of a selection of meat. Also the wait is ridiculous.	2	Tofu Hut	3.5
"Everyone was raving about the oxtail chili cheese fries but it just tasted like a regular chili cheese fries with an egg on top. Nothing extravagant. But the fries itself was pretty good. 

I originally ordered the Kiki's burger and my husband ordered the Miyagi Wagyu burger but then I totally changed my mind so we switched burgers. I personally like the Miyagi burger better. It reminded me of the Manly burger at Umami burger. And my husband says he liked the Kiki's burger better so I guess it all worked out. 

I'm giving it a 3 stars because their food is really yummy but it's also expensive. Also this is the first place in Vegas that has decent boba. I've searched long and hard for boba places that can give me almost the same thing I had in California and this place came pretty close. The only problem is, like I said, it's expensive. And such small portions. But I mean overall I'd still eat here again."	3	Bachi Burger	4
Everyone seems to really love this place and I'm not exactly sure why. It's alright I guess. They don't have much selections on milk teas. Every time I try a new boba place out I always get a taro milk tea and theirs reminded me of Cafe Teaze's taro milk tea and I didn't like it at all. So I ended up ordering a different drink which I believe was just a mango black ice tea and it wasn't anything out of this world amazing it was just decent and refreshing so I enjoyed that. But I don't think this place is worth 5 stars. However, their bobas are a lot better than other boba places. It's cooked just right. I think it's just the matter of their drinks that they need to work on.	3	Brew Tea Bar	5
Fuku burger is an absolute no no. It looked so good on pictures and reviews but when we tried it out, it was so gross and even their garlic fries. They pretty much just fried the fries then sprinkled a crap load of garlic salt to it and it didn't even taste right. I don't know if maybe that I came at a wrong time or that particular cook was horrible, but whatever the case is, they ruined this place for me. It is not the one, sorry. Never trying this place out again.	1	Fukuburger	3.5
The broth\/stock for our pho was very bland and disappointing, very skimmpy on the meat, which I can understand ALMOST about the muscle meat but they even skimped me on my offal.   I really wasn't surprised this place was practically empty of customers.  The food was very meh.	2	Pho Rose	3
We were here with a large group. We ordered dimsum for every one to share and than individual plates. Dimsum was good. I ordered duck and the flavor was very good but a bit fatty. It was however bbq duck and not peking duck so some what expected. Every one ellse got noodles and liked what they got. I think the flavors were a spot on and the portions are nice. We had good service, but then we did have a VIP guest card so that may have made a difference. Not sure what people expect in term of dishes. If you want authentic taste this place is good, if you want to some thing else you may be better off with some asian fusion restaurant. Over all I would definitely come back.	4	Noodles	3
The food was amazing. I felt that the price was well worth the quality of the food. The service was spot on, and the scallops I ordered were the best i ever had.	5	Olives	4
Amazing find!  Fresh and tasty!  Warm bread to start.  The House Salad was a meal in and of itself!  The Red Diablo sauce on the bigoli noodles was absolutely authentic and very, very delicious!  A real gem!  The service was awesome as well.  Only here for a few days, but we know where to go for authentic Italian the next time we are in town!	5	Pastaidea	4.5
I almost want to give this place a extra star because my super skinny nephew never eats all his food and he killed a whole pizza here.  He jus got the plain cheese but my sister tells me he never finishes his food so that speaks wonders about this place.  I got the meat lovers(its called something else) with green peppers.  I ate at this place in Fremont California when a girl I know took me.  This place is like a subway but with pizza and way better ingredients.  The ingredients are fresh and the people behind the counter were very nice and helpful.  The restaurant is very modern and a hipster kind of aura around it.  They have a few pre made set ups but you can build your own and its a great way to mix things up.  Once you throw everything you want on the pizza you sit and they call you up after it comes out the oven.  The line starts all the way to the right behind the little wall.  On a little side note I bought my sister one of the remade salads and she devoured that s*** in like 2 minutes so I'm pretty sure it was pretty good.	5	Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza	4.5
"OK so first off the the burger was great as far as the taste.  But I got super sick after eating it.  I'm talking throwing up exorcist style.  I try not to look into stuff like this because its borderline paranoia, AND IM NOT accusing the restaurant of anything, but my friend and I walk in and theres a guy in front of us, he orders, then I order, then my friend, then a family of 6.  I ordered the easiest item...#1 w\/o the wasabi\/mayo.  For some reason i got my order last.  After my friend, the family of 6, etc.  I just didn't get why.  The place itself is nice.  

Theres anime playing on the tv and also the football game was on as well.  I love that they tell you to pick a funny nickname for when they call you.  There is trap\/hiphop playing in the background.  Pretty sure this place is ran by a young entrepreneur.  The woman behind the counter was nice.  She said they have a truck still on Fremont usually during the weekends.  If I wouldn't have gotten sick I would have given this place 5 stars but I'm still trying to recover from this food!  It crazy too because this location used to be a taco bell and I got sick from that food as well.  Maybe is just a bad omen on that location."	2	Fuku Burger	4
"I don't care what anyone else says this place is Top 3 bars I have ever been to.  So much to do its ridiculous!  I have never had the food just the spirits and the games but my experience here has been nothing but awesome!  Over sized Beer pong, Giant Connect four, corn hole big and small, ping pong, four square like in middle school plus the drinks makes for a great time.  I have been coming here since 2013.  There is only a few set backs; Parking is a b****, The games get crowded at night. Besides that I think this place is Awesome!

PS.... LOTS OF HIPSTERS"	5	Gold Spike	4
"I definitely love the concept of this place.  One side of the menu is health food and the other side is junk food.  The menu is pretty big with lots of options...So depending on how you are feeling you can pick your poison.  The food is excellent, I had a Texas Coast Burger, and a steak here before.  I also had a fountain drink and they are awesome.  Its not Pepsi products or coke... they use a different off brand.  I like the ginger ale and the root beer ;) The ambience is chill, the employees were very nice and very cute... Football was on and I asked if they could change the channel and they did no problem.  The inside is a little small but there is a outside area as well on the side.  

This place is great I would definitely try it out."	5	SkinnyFATS	4.5
Sagos is a great place especially during football season.  They have two projector screens that are 200+ in size and if you don't want want to watch that specific game they have multiple LCD screen and little radios so you can hear the other games... And all the female bartenders are hot!!  :)	5	Sagos Baja Tavern & Lounge	4
"Great Great Great place to eat!  I have a friend in the casino industry that always gets the hook up here.  I'm not a seafood person but its unlimited crab legs first of all so theres that.  I always see my friends grab like 20+ of those things.  I usually get the prime rib and other things that go with it.  Nothing besides the prime rib, crab legs, and lamb really stick out as far as meat.  There is a asian food section, dessert, and from what I can tell a cross between greek and indian section.  The food was great.  You can order booze of course but it cost extra.  This is the pricing;

I came here for Sunday night football and Thursday night football.  Both times were excellent.  1st off the food was actually amazing.  If you've ate at hooters before you should know the food here but everything tasted freshly made the wings and fries.  Also the beer was fresh and our area was clean.  Looking at some of the reviews I think guys have a set perception the girls here are suppose to flirt with them and kiss their ass...Thats not the case here.  All the ladies I felt with were professional and as long as you are courteous an nice they will be too.  I don't expect them to call me sweetie or any B.S. like that.  Most of the girls are super young like 18-22...  Most are beautiful of course and the bartenders are the same!  There are two really big screens to view with other televisions around the eating area.  This is the biggest hooters restaurant from what they say.  I had a great experience here so five stars from me!  ;)	5	Hooters	3
"I love this place.  If I lived in Vegas still this would be my go to place for breakfast\/brunch.  1st thing from what I can tell everything is pretty much made fresh.  I had the biscuits and gravy special.  The biscuit was so good and same thing with the Gravy.  A side of bacon and house fries... The other times I came here I had the western omelet.  My friend Vinny had the waffles and he said it was  ""Really good"".  

The location is on Decatur, and Sahara.  Its not a hole in the wall but it would be hard to spot off of the street.  Its in the closed down Circuit City center.  Mary herself has a very bubbly and interesting sense of humor.  The waitresses are pretty attentive and are always walking around passing out jelly samples for your toast.  I had strawberry and peach.  They even had jalapeño jelly...My friend vinny said it was good.  All in all I would definitely come here for breakfast.  Super good and fresh.

I always sat at the bar area around the TV but from what I can tell they are usually busy so get there early."	5	Mary's Hash House	4
"If I could give this place 10 stars I would.  Uhhh .. A Brazilian steak house with a splash of Texas style BBQ and flavor.  If I was a female my panties would be soaked right now... The ambience is super nice.  You are surrounded by a lot of people because the place isn't super big and its usually always busy especially for dinner!  I always make a reservation a day in advance to make sure I get seated with in 5 minutes.  The meat is well prepared, marinated, served, and of course eaten.  I've been here like 10 times in my lifetime!  The salad bar ha some great selections.  I always get the asparagus, and green beans.  For you sick bastards that eat sushi there is a couple sushi selections for you.  The wine list is pretty nice.  I usually get the sangria because it sneaks up on you! 

I didn't know this but they do give a little discount for military (On the food).  The waitress that saw me and my date was awesome.  Wish I remembered her name but she noticed my military ID when I showed it and she told me she'd adjust my check.  You're going to spend $50.00 a plate here so make sure you eat all you can."	5	Texas de Brazil	4.5
"I would come here a lot as a kid because this was one of the closest taco bells around.  The reason this lonely taco bell has such a good rating is the quality of food and the service.  One of the managers Isaiah R. was really cool and friendly.  Its Taco Bell so you know the food but surprisingly it taste better here than most taco bells.

The location is on the corner of flamingo and decatur.  decent size parking lot and its inside of a mini mall.  Drive thru is pretty quick especially late night and again everyone is super friendly."	5	Taco Bell	4
So I never had this place burgers until last week.  I'm at a mehhh... as far as the overall taste of everything.  The Burger was good (Just good) but for $12.95 I would expect the burger to be a knock out.  The fries weren't good at all.  I mean I thought McDonalds fries were better than these fries.  Soggy and greasy potato sticks would be a better description.  Of course my large soda was $3.95.  I'm sorry that movie theater prices.  For the mehhh food and the Super price thats why I gave this place 3 stars.  I don't understand why its so expensive here.  The place itself is in the Excalibur hotel.  You see all kinds of bleacher creature tourist in that place.  The line was pretty long the whole time.  After I ordered I had to wait about 10 minutes for the food to be done.  They give you a pager with a number on it.  The dining part is pretty big.  I would think it fits 100 people at least.  The food was ight...  But from looks alone the milkshakes looked like the best thing here.  Maybe I'll go back for a milkshake next time.	3	Johnny Rockets	2.5
"This place is probably now in my TOP 3 for local bars in Las Vegas!  This place used to be a roadrunner and man oh man they upgraded this place!  So this place took a bit of Gold Spike and they have over sized Jenga, Pool, a deer hunting game, Mini Bowling -- you read that correctly ..... and a ping pong table.  The beer selection is too crazy to type out here.  A lot of craft beers and a lot of options for food.  Speaking of food I had some sliders and fries and it was actually pretty good.  This place is pretty big but it needs to be because its always crowded.  

There is a UNLV Running Rebels section which I thought was pretty awesome.  There is also a nice courtyard area thats on your right when you first walk in.  It was winter time while I was out there but I bet its super cool (Like a biergarten) in the spring and summer.  Theres a little mini bar outside.  BTW The bartender that hooked it up with the ping pong balls thank you for being cool as f***.  This place is super fun.... My only complaint is they need to knock a wall down because its too small for the crowd they get.  This place is big so you can imagine how many peeps are there.  I want to say there is at least 100-150 people there around 2100-TBD.

Even if you aren't a local I recommend this place to get away from the strip and see an awesome sports bar!

Bangkok, like Las Vegas, sounds like a place where you make bad decisions. - Todd Phillips"	5	PKWY Tavern	3
"I love beer gardens like this.  Just a lot of people, good food, and the beer is like angels pissin on your tongue moses :).  The parking is a bit crappy because its crowded here all the time.  Dinner time 5-8 is when this place is super crowded.  Around 9-11 is when the crowd dies down.  This place is super loud from the live band and the open dining area.  The waitresses are dressed in traditional German attire with the dress and their (.)(.) hanging out.  

The venue itself is very big.  There is a outside part as well but this place hasn't been that crowded that I've ever seen.  Restroom has a bathroom attendant on the weekends, and valet if you don't want to park yourself.

The food is excellent.  I had the sausage, with the dunkel.  Ughhh the Germans know how to brew some beer.  Theres a few to choose from but most German restaurants are the same in this aspect.  The band is always engaging with the crowd and playing traditional German songs with some American songs as well.  This place is fun and has so much going on.  Worth the time to check it out."	4	Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas	3.5
Way to overpriced for the quality of food. The service was super nice & good. The food was good. I tried my friend's bloody marry & that was tasty. However I won't be going back. There's way to many other better places to go while in Vegas.	3	T&T - Tacos & Tequila	3.5
"Man oh man this place was fun even though I sucked!  Came here for my friends birthday and it was amazing.  We got there and they said it will be a 30 minute wait... It was more like a 5 minute wait.  We sat at the bar for a little bit and the bartenders were attentive and fun to talk to.  

We were booth 205 and played a basic game.  Its basically darts but playing golf.  Each of the targets (holes) have different point values and you usually swing 5 times then the other player goes.  It does get expensive here so happy hour is probably the best time to go.  We were at $75 an hour when we went and it can get even more expensive.  Our waitress brought my friend these cake balls that you shoot frosting in and holy shit they were amazing.  The drinks were strong and the gold was fun.  There is shuffle board, and corn hole as well.  I heard there is a pool on the 3rd floor and there are huge TVs around the area. 

I'd recommend going here with at least a group of 4 to offset the cost a bit especially if its not durning happy hour.  Be careful of drunk people with golf clubs, and don't fall into the net... :)"	5	Topgolf	4
Great place for a cheap, quick bite to eat. I was drunk every time I've had this, but it was always amazing, like most food is after drinking. Great place to get a little something in your tummy before a night of drinking!	4	Sirrico's Pizza	3.5
This is the absolute worst Buffalo Wild Wings location I have been to. I've tried and tried again to come here (over 5 times) to see if the service gets better, and it doesn't. I love the food do not get me wrong, but that is the only thing that has me coming back to this location. When you first walk in, it is mostly busy, but even when it is not, the Hostess just stares at you and doesn't say anything. I sat there the first time and 3 people walked in after me and were seated while I wasn't. I finally went up to them and told them and all they did was say "Okay" and we had to wait to be seated. I usually brush this off but after we were seated, we didn't get drinks and had to ask to order and flag someone down after 10-15 minutes. After we got our food, which took a while but I didn't mind, we wait 30 minutes after we had asked for the check and To-go boxes over 5 times. The check came, and the to-go boxes never did. After 2 more times of asking, we gave up and left. I still left tip thinking they were just understaffed. As we were leaving, I saw 5 girl workers standing in the corner just talking while it was crazy busy. Then, their manager came out and they all split up pretending to work. I left very annoyed and this was just one experience. I have had 4 other bad experiences at this location which finally put me over the edge to write a review and never go there again. I normally do not give places one star reviews because I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but after this many times, there is obviously a bigger problem. The service.	1	Buffalo Wild Wings	2.5
They have the best bagels. I really mean this,  you can not get the same bagels in California.	5	The Bagel Cafe	4
Good tasting pizza,  it looked a little under cooked, but it was tasty. Maybe it was my fault, because i like a little crispy, and forgot to mention to them on the phone. Thanks.	4	Rocco's NY Pizzeria	4
I always enjoy this very pleasant atmosphere at brio and my spaghetti with spicy sauce I come here for a special occasion to spend time with my family	5	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
I was at this place a few month ago and decided to leave a message today, as I just installed the app. Can not wait to go to this place again. The pasta was one of the best ones I ever had. Even spaghetti from Detroit could not beat it.	5	Grand Lux Cafe	4
Amazing food. Amazing service. You'll get some unique Vietnamese dishes that you won't get anywhere else.	5	Viet Noodle Bar	4.5
This place is amazing!! Not only is the food to die for (BTW they use real crab in the California Roll)but the service and the people who work there are so friendly and nice. I highly recommend this place!	5	On Demand Sushi	4.5
i am sitting here watching an episode of Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares and it reminds me of the awful food we ate last week at Otto.  The expensive wine was very good.  The server was Ok.  The bus boy was Ok (except for when he said right beside me that he need to take a break to use the toilet).  The appetizer was decent.  But the part that was just disgusting were the two pizza's we ordered.   I cannot believe how bad they were.   I have had better frozen pizza's.    I had no idea until I came to this review site that this was a Mario Bitali restaurant.  He needs to get out to this restaurant or have secret people eat there to see how bad the pizzas were.  For the price paid this was totally unacceptable.  That said shame on me for not speaking up at the restaurant it is just I am very unconfortable about doing that.  Hopefully the owners will read my feedback along with the others I see here and make it better for the next customer.	1	Otto Enoteca Pizzeria	3.5
Best bang for your buck here. All you can eat seafood, even oysters and crabs!	5	Makino Sushi & Seafood Buffet	3.5
The manager of the restaurant contacted me and was able to get us the reservation on the date we originally wanted. We very much enjoyed the food and the service. I appreciate the gesture to rectify our experience, but we shall see if the reservations process is fixed the next time we try to go here.	4	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
Very nice staff and service. Very low key place. Never had pupusas before so decided to try it. I thought it was more like a flour tortilla. It seems more like a thick corn tortilla which I personally do not care for. We tried the mixed option. They were somewhat tasty but I just did not care for the corn texture. Beans were runny. They were also a bit on the greasy side but that may be how it is supposed to be.	3	Las Pupusas	3.5
"This place is AH-MAZING!  It has become my new favorite steak place. 

Service is excellent. The hostesses are so polite and friendly. The servers are attentive and knowledgeable. 

The ambience of the restaurant is wonderful. I love sitting on the patio and enjoying the serenity of the Tivoli Village with a great view overlooking the fountain, especially since the weather has been gorgeous. 

The food is to die for. I try to order something different each time. Flavors and spices are paired together with such forethought.  The meat is cooked to perfection every time. 
I don't think the pictures can do this place justice. You just have to come try it for yourself to understand how great the food is."	5	Echo & Rig	4.5
"I had hoped service here had improved since our last visit, but after today, I am convinced this subpar service must be the norm for the place. Owner even messaged after the last review, so really hoped it had improved. But just as a frame of reference, I typed most of this review out while waiting for our server to just check on us to see if everything was ok(that's how long she was taking).

Arrived on a busy Sunday brunch, so we more than expected to wait a little. After being seated at the table, it took 15 minutes just to get drinks. Then another 15 minutes to have our order taken. Waited 20 minutes to get food, only to have it delivered to the table with things missing, like butter for pancakes. Also discovered our table had zero utensils set out for a party of 5.

Waitress scuttles away so fast that we could barely tell her what we needed, so more waiting. 

Usually I love the food for its authentic Jewish fare. Today, I ordered the potato pancakes. Huge, thick portion of 3 pancakes but served with the tiniest serving of sour cream and applesauce. I would expect the $10 cost could cover a bit more condiment with the dish. The patties are so dry that you need something to balance it, but the scale does not fit what they serve. Also took forever to flag the waitress down for this to get a little more.

I should have stuck with my original assessment and just stop in to the deli to get my fix of NY food."	2	The Bagel Cafe	4
I still love the food here, but our most recent experience put a damper on my opinion of the place. Vegas is the Mecca for all you can eat sushi places. This place offers that too. However, it seems they have added so many rules and restrictions to this option that it is detracting from the concept. My favorite is the green mussels. Now you can only have one order. There are now multiple items that are flagged similarly. Sorta defeats the point! I think it is time to find a new sushi joint.	3	Krazy Sushi	3.5
"BEWARE!!! If you order delivery from this location, don't expect to receive a complete order. It took 3 phone calls and an hour wasted of my time to resolve my issue. We ordered at 5:45, waited for delivery guy at 6:40, only to open our bags to find half the order was in the bag. Called the store, and passed around to 3 people before someone could even talk about the problem constructively. No sense of how to resolve a customer's problem at all!  We asked to speak to manager and were told they have no way to get in touch with them (red flag). Big fat lie! Given the usual excuses of ""we are so busy"" ""only one delivery guy"" ""no manager here"". Told them it's obvious you have no manager because then we wouldn't have this problem of an incomplete order. Officially our order was not delivered complete until 7:25.  

The next time you want to get what you pay for, I suggest any other Chinese restaurant than this one. They clearly don't care if they have happy customers unless you want to spend an hour and a half explaining to them how to do their jobs right. 

Normally I would let a mistake slide and give the benefit of the doubt, but this hasn't been the first time and after speaking with everyone in the joint, I'm certain with the way they view customer service, they don't plan on fixing the issues leading to this common mistake. Go to a place that believes in GOOD service!"	1	China One	3
Just goes to show you gotta go to Chinatown area to get great Asian food. I do not usually care for pho but I loved it here. I ordered the mi wonton which was a huge bowl of goodness. Sampled my friends beef pho. I also had the pork buns which was delicious. The service here was perfectly attentive and the bartenders were so friendly. I came here for a night out with a group of friends and they accommodated our party without a glitch. Even separated the bill for us easily. Kudos to this place. I will definitely come back soon.	5	District One	4
"Tried this place for takeout. The food was delicious and menu selection was hearty. Prices are a bit higher than other Chinese restaurants but considering they probably pay a steep rent for the Summerlin location, it's understandable.

The host was extremely helpful when we picked up our order. The added hospitality was a nice touch. 

Will be back for sure in the future!"	5	Chow Mein House	4
We have never eaten in the actual restaurant but typically order take out from here. I like the option to choose from either Chinese or Thai items. I love their Panang. The portions are a good size. I find it strange that they only serve a very small container of steamed rice with the entrees. Seems a bit cheap to me since most other restaurants give you a big serving with an entree. The food tastes fresh so we come back.	3	Little Dumpling	3.5
"This was my first time trying shabu shabu. I loved it. Service here is excellent starting with a friendly greeting as soon as you walk in the door. The servers are very informative on how it all works and super attentive throughout the meal. 

The food was fresh and delicious. Full of great flavors and the meat was fresh. We ordered the pork belly, yojie cut and kobe beef with spicy miso and tonkotsu broths. Portions were hearty. 

Also tried the green tea white chocolate for dessert, but wish I had just gotten regular milk chocolate. Glad I tried something different as it sounded intriguing, but was just ok. 

Dinner and dessert for two came in at under $100, not bad. We felt stuffed at the end

Overall, it was an awesome dinner and we will definitely be back again. Great experience and tasty food!"	5	Yojié Japanese Fondue	4.5
"Another cool little food restaurant in the Centennial Hills area. This restaurant has eat-in seating available, but it seems a bit more geared towards taking out. The guy at the counter was clearly new and not super knowledgeable about the menu yet. However, the manager was extremely friendly and helpful. I appreciated her offering my kids some crayons and pictures to color upon while we waited for our food. 

We tried the flatbreads which were delicious. One full flatbread easily could be a meal for one adult. Cost about $10. 

My husband had the Rocky wrap which was yummy. I had the mango smoothie and it was delicious but a little pricey at $5 (and about half the size of a Jamba Juice cup). 

Overall the menu is geared towards the healthier choices which was great. There are no kid-sized options. I don't have too much negative to say as our food was tasty. The prices could be a little better considering what they serve. Overall, it was a pretty pleasant experience."	4	Muscle Maker Grill - Las Vegas	3.5
"This place was highly recommended by several friends so we checked it out. Very high class atmosphere. The menu is a Mario Batali creation. They have tableside carving of certain steaks which has a nice touch. The steak was tasty and cooked to a perfect temperature. The real specialty is their extensive wine list. The service was excellent. Knowledgeable staff and never had an empty water glass. 

Beware, this place is very pricey. If you are looking for a high class steakhouse, this is it. Definitely a great place to impress a date."	4	Carnevino	3.5
This was our first time venturing to downtown Summerlin. This cafe was excellent. Service was friendly and attentive. Food was delicious. They serve the breakfast items all day. Decent kids menu. Options of menu choices were fair in terms of number of different items, but what they do make was delicious. Lots of choices from the fancy soda fountain. I liked that there were non-carbonated items for the kids too. Ambience is contemporary and modern. Overall, we had a great experience and plan to return in the future.	4	MTO Café	3.5
Came through the drive-thru for a quick bite to eat. I was appalled by the poor service we received. While placing our order, the girl at the window had an attitude as if we were inconveniencing her by placing our order. She kept trying to rush us even though we had more items to add to our order. Then upon pulling up to the window, we were given the wrong item. When we brought it to her attention, no apology whatsoever. There was just a whole air of poor customer service. Now I remember why I was never a big fan of Del Taco. Will be awhile before I return to this location.	2	Del Taco	3
Food is delicious. Service is okay. Ambience is fancy. Prices are pretty inflated. There are better steakhouses in town, IMO.	4	T-Bones Chophouse	3.5
"We are always on the look out for a great Mexican spot for basic quick food in the NW. We came here a couple times based on the rave Yelp reviews, but sadly this didn't live up to simple expectations. 

The first time, I ordered the taco combo with hard shells and asada. And that's just what I got. A hard shell and meat. That's it! No lettuce, pico, cheese...nothing. These looked pathetic and nothing like the pictures they have on an iPad near the register. Not even cilantro or onion. 
The combo comes with rice and beans which were flavorless and bland. Nothing authentic at all. $7.99

My hubby ordered the carne asada fries. The asada itself tasted good. Not too greasy. This item was pretty good. $8.99

So we went back to give this place another shot. 

I ordered the taco combo again but the street taco style. I specifically asked for extra cilantro and onion. Picture is attached to the review. Cilantro was clearly not fresh, and barely any. The carnitas lacked much flavor and were super dry. Also a very disappointing dish. 

Cheese quesadilla was fine, but way overpriced at $5.99

My husband ordered the burrito combo and realized at home that the combo we paid for was not given to us. 

There is no kids menu and the prices are inflated. 

The service is pleasant and they clearly are trying hard to be hospitable here. 

Bottom line, we're still looking for our go-to Mexican spot that's not some chain. Not even worth complaining to management because the food just isn't that good. And for their price point, I don't anticipate seeing this place stay in business very long."	2	Sin Fronteras Tacos	4.5
Finally got to try some Ramen in the side of town that is known for it. This place does not look like much from outside, but the food was delicious. My portion was perfect. The pork belly was so good and the broth was awesome. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful in guiding us to a great choice from the menu. I will definitely recommend coming here and cannot wait to come back.	5	Fukumimi Ramen	4
"I have heard good things about this place and we finally had a chance to try it for dinner. Nice atmosphere tucked away from the hustle of the casino. Our server Patsy was excellent. She was attentive without being overbearing. 
The meal started with a bread basket. It was fresh and so delicious. The pretzel bread was one of the best I have tasted in awhile. They also served a raisin nut bread and sourdough. Both were so tasty.  I had the seared ahi tuna appetizer. The sauce it came with was excellent. Great dish. I had the petite filet and sea scallops for my entree. The steak was so tender and cooked exactly to the temperature I ordered. I chose the garlic cilantro sauce and it was fabulous. The scallops were average meaning they were good but nothing special that I have not experienced elsewhere. We really enjoyed our meal here and will definitely come back in the future."	5	The Charcoal Room	4
"Just another Italian restaurant in the Northwest. We tried out a few different entree items and their funnel cake and rice pudding. The entrees were average in terms of the taste. The prices are average with similar Italian places. The counter help left something to be desired. Portion sizes are large. 

The desserts were not so great. Definitely sounded better on the menu than they tasted."	3	Brother's Italian Bistro	3
"We came here with a large party, more than 10 people. I was impressed that they could accommodate such a big group. The food was excellent. I chose the sea bass and it was moist and flavorful.  My hubby ordered the black cod and it was also delicious. BUT... I thought the prices were outrageous. The dish was $40 a la carte. Sides were over $10. The cocktails were $16. 

We presented our server with a Yelp offer for 30% off drinks for locals, but they did not take it off our bill. Even after asking about it, the server insisted it had been removed but it was not noted on the receipt nor did the figures add up to any discount. In addition, they charged our party a special fee for the group. Plus the expected automatic 18% gratuity. 

Normally, I tip well for decent service but the service at this place was horrible, especially considering all these fees they charged us. It took our server 15 minutes to bring our cocktails. When we were ready for the check, it took 20 minutes for them to bring it. The servers were hardly around nor did they check on the table much. 

Even though the food was good, I would not recommend this place to anyone based on poor service. Looking at other reviews, I am not alone in this experience."	2	Andrea's	4
Very trendy place with multiple options for seating... Booths, tables, bar stools, and couches. Have come here twice with young kids and do not thing the menu is quite set up for small kids. The food was pretty tasty but on the trendy side. Items are a la carte. Menu changes often, so dont expect to order what other yelpers have posted pics of... It may be gone.	4	Hearthstone Kitchen & Cellar	4
Huge menu selection to satisfy anyone. This location always packed at prime hours. Servers are okay. Sometimes a little inattentive on checking on you. Food is yummy like all the places in the chain. Portions are big so eat half and save room for dessert. The cheesecake is super rich so eat half and save for a late night snack.	4	The Cheesecake Factory	3.5
"I first came here with some business colleagues for a quick bite to eat. I can't say enough good things about this place! 

The food consists of Bulgarian and Russian inspired dishes. Portions are average size and I'd suggest ordering a few things to share with your party. I recommend the bacon wrapped dates and the grape leaves. You'll definitely find foods that are very unique compared to other usual fare. Every item I have tried is delicious and seasoned well. They even have a secret spice blend to put in your olive oil for bread dipping.

The place is small inside with half being dining and half is a marketplace. But it's a pleasant ambience.

The service was super friendly and the servers are happy to answer any questions about the menu. They are always perfectly attentive and the kitchen serves up food fresh and quickly. 

I highly recommend this place especially if you're looking for something a little different to try eating!"	5	Forte European Tapas Bar and Bistro	4
Located inside Caesars, this place was a little challenging to find. Payard is known for their gourmet chocolates but I was curious about their baked goods. Come prepared to wait and seating is very limited. The Almond Croissant (only $4) was amazing and worth the wait. The Iced Caramel Macchiato wasn't worth the $6 and disappointing, and the chocolate croissant was ok. Next time I'm sticking to the chocolates and almond croissant. I spent $31 on 2 iced macchiato, a parfait, and 2 croissants. Breakfast fail.  I give this place four stars only for their chocolates and the almond croissant.	4	Payard Pâtisserie & Bistro	3.5
After you're seated (1 hour wait on a Saturday afternoon), there's an additional 30-40 minutes until your food is served from the time you order. There are no appetizers on the menu. Biscuits are $2 each. Overpriced and over hyped if you ask me. It's definitely a tourist spot.	3	Hash House A Go Go	4
"We're from California where healthy\/socially conscious is all the rage. Whole Foods in our area is a big go to spot for fresh smoothies. This place is only 4 miles off the strip and pride themselves on providing a healthy, organic, and locally sourced eating experience. 

We came here for breakfast and I can say that it was one of the more memorable breakfasts I've had in Vegas. We ordered 2 smoothies: Veggie Delight and Peach. The Peach smoothie was light and sweet. The Veggie Delight was a hit of unexpected freshness. I had expected it to taste grassy but it's so refreshing with a note of sweetness from the banana. Watch out Whole Foods because this smoothie will give you a run for your money. Their Green Eggs and Ham pide was delicious. I loved the fact that I could get a little bit of the egg yolk on every bite. The pide dough on its own was good but then you add the egg, the ham, and the pesto and its just yummy goodness in your mouth. Seasoned just right. Its definitely not your normal egg breakfast. I can't wait to come back and try some of their other pides."	5	Presto Cafe	4.5
Went to this BBQ joint because another restaurant had an hour wait. Much to our surprise this place surpassed all of our expectations and this will be a must see slot every time we come to vegas!!! The staff is super friendly and the food was insane!!!	5	Rollin Smoke Barbeque	4.5
Worst fastfood restaurant ever. Get in the drive through and no one talked to me. Stuck in there for 20 mins for nothing. Fucking dumb ass restaurant	1	McDonald's	1.5
Not that great but it was OK that's why I gave 3 stars. I think there are better buffets out there, but this price on the strip is ideal for the stop prices that is.	3	Le Village Buffet	3
I love wing stop wings but this location sucks bad! I went after work last night because I was tired and didn't want to cook of course. Well first things first I am a Chef and know how long some wings should take, well they took forever about 40min to come out and it wasn't even busy. That alone made me curious to if my wings are sitting or going to be extremely over cooked. Well I got home ready to eat and took a bite of my first wing, it was beyond over cooked. So over cooked I couldn't even eat it it was like trying to eat a rock. There are no wing stops close to my house so I had to go to this location but I will never go back again. Hopefully all locations are not like this one. Also there was a couple that came in about five minutes after me and sat at the bar, they got their food 10 minutes before me that pissed me off as well. Just a bad wing stop all around from FOH to BOH... Avoid them and go else where.	1	Wingstop	3
3 stars only because it is In N Out but the customer service I have come accustom too are not here at this location. I go back every now and again just to see if they have gotten better but its the total opposite. The food is also not the standard In N Out typically puts out but hey its Burgers and Fries so I don't expect much.	3	In-N-Out Burger	4.5
I have mixed reviews about this place. The first couple times I went during the day the cook made our food pretty good. But later in the day I think it's the owner cooking but it's not as good. Even heard him talking one night I went and he said he was stretching the chili (watering it down). So I guess you take your chance going.	3	Sammy's LA Pastrami & Burgers	3
Good food great people... 4 stars only because I was comparing them to a place back home and they didn't meet the same level but that's just me... they are worth going to though...	4	Fish King Grill	4.5
Saw this place on Guy Feddi's show and thought I would check it out. The pizza we had was the cheesesteak and the mozzarella sticks. It was amazing. It was busy but totally worth it.	5	Those Guys Pies	4
We were here a yr ago and really enjoyed the food. This time it was 100% worst - food quality was bad and for $20 for buffet for dinner, it was really not worth it. If they don't change food quality. It's matter of time before this place disappears!	1	Tamba	3.5
"I would give this restaurant negative stars if I could. True customer service shows through when there is an incident. Unfortunately this restaurant responds very poorly to incidents. The servers here would have let my friend die on the floor if it meant we didn't file a report.

But we did file a report. Both myself and my boyfriend got food poisoning from bad foie gras. We tasted it--it tasted funky--so we sent it back, only to be snubbed by the servers. Then 30 min later we went to the bathroom to vomit. We told the servers and they did nothing for us. After about 15 min, they finally called a professional inspector to file a food safety report.

A full 30 min later, the food safety guy finally came over. At that same time, my other friend was walking back from the bathroom and took a horrendous spill on their slippery floor, hitting her chin and spraining her ankle badly. It swelled like twice the normal size within minutes. The most horrible part: For literally 10 sec, not a single server came to help her. There were like 10 servers there, and they just watched her writhe on the floor in pain.

The inspector ended up filing a report for both incidents. We called the manager of the restaurant (Robert Nikodem) to tell him what had happened. We were appalled by the restaurant's lack of response to both incidents, and hoped he would show us some respect and at least apologize for the terrible experiences we had. Unbelievably, the manager actually snapped at us (like literally talked down to us like children!) and then immediately brought us our check. 

We paid the full $300+ for our meal even though we never even got the other half of the courses we ordered. We want to be clear that we never once tried to get out of paying, yet we were treated like second class citizens and quickly shooed out the door.

But we didn't care. All we wanted was to leave that horrible horrible place. You can tell that the culture of a place pervades every person who works there. Unfortunately for Sage, the terrible lack of customer focus pervades each person from the manager down to the servers. I hope the Vegas hospitality gods give this place what's coming to them and shut this place down for good."	1	Sage	4
Really wishing the atmosphere of this place was better. The lady at the register is extremely rude and there is no other noise (music) except her clanking dishes. The pizza is good the wings are good but the service is lacking. Big time.	3	Brother's Italian Bistro	3
D-lish! Great sandwich spot. The Dutch Bread is amazing and the meat used tastes great! Can't wait to try all the different kinds of sandwiches!	5	The Sandwich Spot	4.5
Sitting in kneaders right now. After a 45 minute wait, we received our food. Two ham and cheese croissant sandwiches two smoothies and a breakfast sandwich. Absolutely ridiculous. When I went to the counter to ask what is taking so long, they replied most people order online. What?? Then why am I standing here with 5 other disgruntled customers? Another woman who has waited as long as me said she wanted a refund and was going to leave. They handed her her food. No offer of a discount free brownie or cookie for her wait. Unbelievable. I will not be back, and I live around the corner.	2	Kneaders Bakery & Cafe	3.5
"Great service, super prices, and friendly, attentive wait staff.

Angela, one of the waitresses, is an absolute doll.   :-)

We will definitely be back."	4	Binion's Cafe	3
Worst customer service. The dude doesn't even know where the guest are seated. Allotted our table twice to others while we are grabbing the food from buffet.	1	Gandhi India's Cuisine	3.5
I have ordered from this place several times.  Each time the delivery was quick and the food was great!  Definitely recommend!	5	Pizza Company	4
I was a little nervous about this place given the other reviews, but after skipping it previously and trying 808 sushi (which was disappointing) I thought I would give it a try.  I ordered a couple rolls to go and was pleasantly surprised with the food.  I thought it all tasted very good, which is awesome since this place is very close to my home.  Everything seemed really fresh.  Granted I have only had a couple of rolls, but I would encourage you to try it for yourself.  I personally don't think the other reviews give it justice.	4	Inaka Sushi	2.5
This place made an awesome Acai bowl that was fresh and made to order with delicious ingredients! I was visiting for a work trip and wanted something light for breakfast and this spot hit the nail on the head! This will be a go to for me when in Vegas for work!	5	Vitality Bowls	4
Wasn't a super big fan of the Acai sorbet in my Acai bowl. I don't understand why places don't blend the Acai fresh and mix it with some fruit and juice or hemp milk or whatever. Just seems super lazy to me and it's not as good. There are better spots in Las Vegas I would rather spend time driving too.	3	Greens and Proteins	4
This place has some great shops but the amount of annoying tourists that shop here can be overwhelming. Sometimes there are even lines at kind of normal standard shops which is insane. I've always got what I needed but just be prepared for gnarly parking and an intense vibe	4	Las Vegas South Premium Outlets	3.5
If I could I would give it zero stars worst place to go and eat worst service doesn't give you your order right and food is old please close this place or mange it batter	1	Robertos Taco Shop	2.5
Cool chill place for lunch. You can see the water fountain show at the Bellagio from here. Our waiter Sean was very nice and extremely funny. We would definitely come back!	4	HEXX kitchen + bar	4
Great Sushi oasis in the desert!  I went this place based on a recc. from a co-worker, while in town on business.  I am glad that we did.  Got the WSOP roll, salad and some Nigiri tuna.  All great.  Have gone back a couple of times since.  It does get crowded in the evening (after 7) and is intimate, so get there early to avoid waiting outside in the las vegas summer.	4	Naked Fish's Sushi & Grill	4.5
I love this place! Favorite restaraunt in Vegas.  We usually eat at the bar when we go, but the table service has been excellent as well.  Blaise and Christina the bartenders are friendly and have a great memory.   Try one of the house special espresso shots with dessert!    As for the food, it is fantastic too.  I have had the filet with the balsamic on the side, great combo.  Also the pasta are all handmade and the meat sauces are really MEATY!  Try the Gnocchi with bolognese and some marscapone cheese.  Off the menu item, but great flavor.    They have fresh made gellato and some fun 'create your own' canollis for dessert.	5	Nove Italiano	4
"I don't know where you can find snails in Las Vegas but this place is really good. I got the coconut snails and it was amazing. The customer service is top notch and very friendly. The food proportion is very big even if you order a simple bowl of rice or pho. Their sauces is very good and it goes with everything, 

Even though we over eat there because of how good the food was, the music was kind of loud and I have no idea what the music was singing but it sounds good. I like whatever they were playing on the tv. 

Would definitely come back to this place again."	5	Pho Khong Ten	4
Best food of Las Vegas ever. Came back and ordered more than 5 plates. The service was outstanding and very quick. I highly recommended this place.	5	Hue Thai	3.5
We always hit this place when staying at the Belllagio.  One of the best shrimp wonton noodle soups I've ever had with giant shrimp packed into their wontons and a delciously rich broth.  Also have had the wok-fried Penang style Kweuy teaw with beef and it was perfect with very tender beef.  Don't know about the fancy dishes, but stick with the noodles and you won't be disappointed.  I don't take price into account in my reviews, because everything in the casinos is overpriced.	5	Noodles	3
"Love this place so much! My wife and I eat here every time we go to Vegas! 
Majority of the staff is a delight (with the exception of one of the female hostess)

The waiters are great! The drinks are amazing and the food is too damn good!
The price is reasonable especially for the quality you get. 

I have tried almost every margarita they have there and you can't go wrong with any of them. The PB and J one is one of my favorites there. Try the BBQ pork quesadilla! You will not be disappointed! 5\/5 for sure"	5	Hussong's Cantina Las Vegas	3.5
The food is good here! I didn't get to try and mixed drinks though. I stayed with just the dos Equis. But the atmosphere is nice and the setting fits the area. Only been here once, the waiter we had only came around three times and Ignored us when I tried to get his attention on several occasions. With him aside though. Great place to try out and relax	4	T&T - Tacos & Tequila	3.5
The Peppermill is always good at anytime! I have been here late nights, early mornings and during the day. Anytime I go they have fast service and are always on it.	5	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
I have only been there one time, and the macaroons were amazing! My wife and I try many different places that have macaroons and this is easily in our top 3 if not the best... we have not tried anything else there yet though. The staff is cool.	5	Manan Bakery	4
Horrible place to eat! Even wth the coupon they give. They give you $20 off with the coupon and it's still bad. The people that work there think they are in some high end LA sushi place. The rice is dry and the plates didn't taste fresh. We will never go back again. I have had better sushi from a grocery store. And that is pathetic	1	Rice & Company	3
Do not go to this place. Overpriced and food poorly made. A group of six friends went there last tuesday and was a horrible experience. Out of four meal orders, three had to be returned to kitchen and even that two of them were sent back to us frozen inside, which means bad and lame preparation by the chef. The pasta was so so and oily. The wine list was overpriced compared to the menu. Manager came to apologize but was too late. The experience had already gone bad. We were so excited about this place because of its location, Aria Hotel, but it does not deserve to be in a place like this. We strongly do not recommend this restaurant.	1	Sirio Ristorante	3.5
Delicious food! When you're wanting to grab a quick tasty bite, this is the place. Healthy and easy to order. Would recommend!	5	Krayvings	4
Delicious food, great atmosphere here. The bar area opens up to the outside so you can either sit outside or inside with the outside shining in. I had the tortilla soup and the street tacos, both were super delicious. We also ordered the guacamole and had the house salsa. Good choices! This would be a fun place for a large group as well as just 2 people. The music they played was of good variety as well. Overall have a great time with great food!	5	Libre Mexican Cantina	4
"I frequent this Panera and usually am quite satisfied. Today 5\/15\/17 my husband and I went way after the lunch rush. About 3:00 pm. Upon ordering the cashier was great, no complaints. She informed me that the Fuji apple chicken salad could only be made today with real apples as they had run out of the dried apples. I agreed that would be just fine. When I received my salad, the apple was cut in about 6 wedges, both ends of the stem included. It was thrown in the salad and was NOT done with any care. I had to pick them out. To top it off, I was given no dressing and had to go interrupt the workers that were mostly disinterested if I could get dressing. Additionally the place was a mess and a female employee at the pick up counter (customer side) was playing around with a coworker behind the counter so loud that it was quite annoying. Laughing and acting as though they were at the pool. 
So disappointed in this visit. I hope it was a fluke."	3	Panera Bread	3
Wonderful dinner place! Delicious food great outdoor seating, good service. Definitely recommend!	5	Trattoria Reggiano	4
Very tasty food! Atmosphere on the patio is amazing. Service was fantastic. Nothing we requested was forgotten. More bread, done! More wine, done! Food was delivered exactly as ordered. We were very impressed with our first visit to Salute. Have to give a shout out to our server, Kevin. Thanks for being so  good at your job! ;)	5	Salute Trattoria Italiana	3.5

"This is an updated review based on my visit last night compared to my last visit 4 years ago during peak hours.

This club is everything a guy could ask for in a gentleman's club. Beautiful girls with gorgeous bodies and surprisingly really fun personalities if you don't come off as a creep or asshole. I have high standards when it comes to women and looks and all the girls here were 8s and above, with 10s every 4 girls or so and 9s every other girl, no lie.

The entrance I believe is $40 but make sure to call them to use the complimentary limo service to not only have that entrance fee waived, but arrive there in style in a stretch limo. Don't even matter if you're by yourself. Just make sure to tip the driver $5\/each guy or gal in your party.

The music was on point all 4 hours I was there and the dj deserves a raise for that. He'd go from electronic, to hip hop, to techno with flawless ease and if there was a dance floor, I probably would've been on it. I salute you, dj.

I do have 2 gripes if you'd consider these gripes. Nothing major:

1. If you're an asthmatic, stay away. Smoke everywhere. I don't even smoke yet I woke up the next day smelling like cigarettes still. That's how bad it is. Small price to pay though for all the gorgeous women.

2. So many places to sit, yet all the seats were taken because it was packed. Only option was to take a girl to either the vip, champagne room, or rhino room.

Some tips from me:

1. Set a spending limit and don't use the atm in there. It hits you with a $45 atm transaction fee. No thank you.

2. There's a back room where it's $100 for 3 dances in a more secluded setting. They don't tell you this but there's also a $45 2 drink minimum for you and the girl so it comes out to $145 each time you're in there.

3. Don't be shy. If there's a really hot girl that you want, grab her before someone else does. These girls are the ones in high demand.

4. Some girls can be pushy. Don't do anything unless you really want to. It's your money. You do what you want.

Overall, an awesome experience and I highly recommend it if you have the cash."	5	Spearmint Rhino Las Vegas	3.5
"Scallops were delicious. If you get an Identity Membership card at the front desk (free btw) you get a complimentary margarita with the purchase of a margarita.

Overall, definitely an interesting menu combining both latin and asian cuisine to form a fusion of deliciousness."	5	China Poblano	3.5
"I've been looking forward to writing this review. This is based off of 3 separate visits at different times. Since I had a hotel credit of $26\/Day, this is the only place where you can use it since you can't use it at a store or the frozen drinks store:

Visit 1: Ordered Philly fries at 8pm. About 5 other orders ahead of me. Took 40 minutes to get my fries and by the time I got it, it was cold. (-2 stars)

Visit 2: Ordered a slice of combo pizza around 3pm. Pretty busy with about 7 orders ahead of me and 5 people behind me. After waiting for 20 minutes for what should be really as simple as throwing the slice in the oven for 2 minutes, I go back up to the counter and they tell me there was a mix up and there's no combo pizza left. I had to get a Hawaiian pizza instead. (-2 stars)

Visit 3: Ordered another round of Philly fries around 3pm. Not as busy as the 2nd time. Old lady at the front was rude and made no effort to see why I couldn't charge the pizza to my room. Had to pay out of pocket instead of using my hotel credit. Took 15 minutes this time to get my Philly fries. A new record. (0 stars)

Overall, whoever manages this place needs to be FIRED. Absolutely disgusted at how inefficiently run this place is and how rude some of the employees can be. Even with the $26\/day hotel credit, it's honestly not even worth it to put up with the other stuff that comes with it. Spend your money at MGM or Excalibur next door for better food options and service."	1	South Beach Food Court	2
"I completely agree with some of the reviews below me about the bad service. Sure, the staff are friendly enough, but the wait time is just ridiculous. Maybe I came at a bad time at 1230 in the morning and everyone was just tired, but that really isn't an excuse for over an hour of waiting for 6 plates of food.

This place would've gotten 4\/5 stars if it wasn't for the wait time. At least when the food finally came out, it wasn't all that bad. 

If you're really hungry and looking for a late night snack, this isn't the place to go. You'll be extremely starving and grumpy by the time the food comes out."	2	Northside Café and Chinese Kitchen	3.5
"I've been to XS, Marquee, and Omnia, and out of the 4 clubs, I couldn't really tell you the difference between Hakkasan and the rest of them. I still had a great time but it's not really unique. Just like Marquee and Omnia, there's a main dance floor that plays edm and a smaller hip hop room called Ling Ling's. The size of both the main floor and hip hop room are probably the exact same size as Marquee. Just like all the other clubs, drinks are expensive as hell. I feel like if you go to Omnia, you don't really need to go to Hakkasan.

For guys and gals, get pre-sale tickets beforehand. Tickets at the door have been rumored to cost up to $100. As a guy, I only paid $45 online. Plus you don't have to wait in an obnoxiously long line. Sure you can be put on the guest list but by 9:30pm, the guest list line was already snaking around the outside so you'll be standing outside for a hot minute waiting to get into a club that opens at 11pm.

Overall, it's a fun club, don't get me wrong. I just feel like you've not really missing out on much if you go to either Omnia or Marquee instead."	3	Hakkasan Nightclub	2.5
I had the most awesome breakfast ever. Service was great and the staff was fun and very accommodating. I placed my order for the breakfast burrito, received my coffee told the sweet cashier I was going to gamble and would be back. She actually took the time to stop by and tell me she just put the order down so I had additional time to play. Finished playing food was ready , ate in the nice clean patio area. Great tasting and wonderful portion size!	5	Glazier's Food Marketplace	3.5
"The proximity of the hotel to the strip for half the cost of a strip hotel room is a huge plus. The rooms were also very nice for the cost.

My only issue is this and it set the tone for the rest of my stay here which is why I gave it two stars:

As someone who is currently active duty military and looking to relax and enjoy myself before going on deployment, the treatment I received from the front desk staff was not very welcoming. I booked a room for 2 double beds via Vegas.com. According to the front desk when I checked in, the room isn't a guarantee since it was with a third party so the only room they had available was a King bed which would be fine if I was traveling by myself but this wasn't the case.

The front desk then told me that I had to wait if I wanted to get a room with two double beds. For how long, she couldn't say and I asked if I could try again Saturday morning when people checked out but she said they were fully booked that day as well. So pretty much if you don't book your room on the main Westin website, nothing is guaranteed. Maybe a free upgrade to compensate for the lack of availability of the pre-paid room would've been nice and something that's happened before at other hotels I've stayed at on the strip but it wasn't the case here. 

I'd say it's worth it to spend that few extra dollars and stay at a hotel that actually guarantees you the room you requested."	2	Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa	3
"I've been to a lot of buffets and this is by far the best buffet I've ever been to.

The selection, the service, the environment, and the food was all top-notch, which is what you would expect from a buffet that costs $50+ for lunch.

They start clearing out the lunch buffet at 2:30pm and are closed between 3 and 5 so if you plan on coming during lunch, make sure to give yourself enough time to stand in line followed by grubbing on some food after that.

They also give a 10% military discount so make sure to have your military ID on hand if this applies to you!"	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
FABULOUS!!! A little on the pricy side but so well worth it! Customer friendly!!!! Fabulous app so you can order and pick up on your way home from work.	5	Marco's Pizza	3.5
A group of 4 of us were in Vegas for a birthday, and came across this place. Amazing tacos! There is such a variety of taco fillings and meat. The guacamole and chips are also a must-have. They have a really good chips to guacamole ratio, and even offered us more chips after. Great food, customer service, and ambiance. Can't wait to come back to Vegas so we can eat here again.	5	Tacos & Beer	4
"If you are looking for an elegant dining experience, this is the place. Their staff is impeccable, very knowledgeable and accommodating. There when you need them, away when you are busy eating (I have disdain for servers asking how is everything right after you have removed the fork from your mouth!)
The food was excellent except for a couple of items in my opinion:
1) The stone crabs - they were tasteless
2) The Madagascar Shrimp - so large they were like grilled beef and with little taste

The main course was fabulous as I had the crab stuffed shrimp and the Chateau Lafitte Bordeaux wine was so smooth, WOW!!!"	4	Joes Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab	4.5

Food was great but very disappointed with the staff!! The host walked and talked and served everyone but me?? She offered extra pitta bread and to go boxes and never once came my way? I had lunch by my self which I do often and I really felt some type of way that I didn't get same treatment as the other customers..... next time I'll do take out	3	Crazy Pita Rotisserie & Grill	4
"This place is incredible!
We had the pork bun app and split it and it was so flavorful and tasty. then we split the Euro Burger and my husband said it was the best burger he had ever had and he eats out all the time. For desert the Sticky Toffee Pops they were fun to have a gourmet push up with toffee, brownie and ice cream. We walked away stuffed and happy!"	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
We arrived here for lunch before our road trip back home.  The place was packed and we had to wait about 10-15 min for a party of 6.  I read the mixed reviews for the Bun Bo Hue and wanted to give it a try.  First we ordered the pork spring rolls and I must say they make a very good, fresh spring roll! The pork meat was warm and they give a house sauce that was different, but good- we just added some spice to it. My husband ordered the pho and it was flavorful and good. Now to the Bun Bo Hue, it was not impressive or flavorful. The meat was plentiful and good, but the broth was the opposite- bland & mediocre. The service was very friendly & cashier made me laugh!	3	Pho Bosa	4
The staff is extremely friendly, but the wait time for our food was extremely too long.  All we ordered was their spring rolls, egg rolls and pho. There was only one other table with three people sitting there, but it seems like I waited 45-60 min for our food to arrive.  We are from out of town and wanted to eat lunch and go, but we ended up staying longer than anticipated. The spring rolls were good and crunchy, and had a difference taste because they put meat in it.  Their pho was bland.  I also ordered the cafe sua da that was too strong and I had to ask for more creamer.  It's ok to try if you have time to eat here.	3	Nem Nuong Bistro	4
Doh!! This place is a no brainier for the best donuts in Las Vegas!! The Homer is a must for any Simpons fan who loves donuts. Great tasting and super creative creations won't disappoint as long as you get here early	5	Donut Bar	4.5
We got into town pretty late and decided to come eat here for dinner.  We used the Yelp check-in for a tempura shrimp and egg roll was a nice treat before our entrees.  My husband ordered the Kung Pao Chicken which was flavorful and good. I got the seafood salad and it has a good portion that we shared, it taste was mediocre. I expected it to be more spicy, but it was not. There was a 2-man band that was entertaining because we kept catching him mis-pronounce words in the songs- he mostly sang Ed Sheeren and some other top 40's. My husband kept waiting for him to play 80's- which he did not. I did notice there was a child still up and playing when it's so late into the night, but I did come in on Saturday night.  This place wasn't so bad, but it didn't stand out or make an impression on me either.	3	Khun Chai Thai Restaurant	4
Come here if you want to wait 20 minutes to place an order with a worker that just doesn't care. Perhaps he's too cool to work? I'm not sure.	1	McDonald's	2
Very casual ambiance. Selective choices much like a buffet form of your own build it yourself poke bowl. The quality of the bowls were fresh and the staff was very helpful if this is your first time. The portions don't live up to the price however. So be cautious and make sure you order the exact value to your bowl. The location is convenient but of most of the selection, poke was more of the delicious choice if you're into fresh fish.	4	Soulfish Poke	3.5
This past weekend, my partner had a party here for her job promotion. We reserved the Tumbleweed for the party, but since it was so hot outside, they let us take it inside until 9pm. Our server was Ann Marie and she was AWESOME!!! If you're planning on having a party here, place a request in for Ann Marie. She was very attentive with all our guests, very professional and super sweet!	5	Gold Spike	4
What an awesome place! I was taken here for my birthday dinner and was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was great, the food was to die for, the fancy drinks were yummy and the 80's music was rad. Their selection of fresh seafood was plentiful and high quality. I cannot wait to go back again.	5	Other Mama	4.5
Love this place! I've been going to Grape Street for over 10 years now. The food is always yummy. The wine is always excellent. The service is always 1st class. I've always had a very positive dining experience at Grape Street.  Now, for items you must try: Baked Brie, Fried Calamari, Roasted Garlic Bulbs, Tapas Plate, House Salad (light onions), and finally... Bowtie Olivia. After a few of those items, I'm too stuffed for dessert.	5	Grape Street	3.5
"MTO Cafe just opened at 1:00pm on Oct. 22nd so the timing of the 1st three reviews are a little suspicious. The cafe is on the smaller side, but well designed and welcoming. I ordered the Skuna Bay Salmon wrap, which was not what I expected. The wrap had eggs in it, which were not listed in the description, and I do not like salmon and eggs cooked together. I was expecting something more like a wrap version of lox and bagels. Aside from that fact, I think other people would like this combination. For a $12 wrap, I would have expected it to include chips or fries, but it didn't so I also ordered a side of fries... which where unseasoned and ""floppy"". 

Overall, it's nice to have another dining option downtown, but I think MTO Cafe is a little on the pricey side for breakfast and lunch offerings. It will be interesting to see how they do over time."	3	MTO Café	4.5
A definite MUST when in the NorthWest part of town. Just dined there tonight for our first time and we will definitely be back. The sushi was outstanding and the staff was so friendly. For me, the true test is the quality of the Salmon Roe and the preparation of the Salmon Skin Hand Roll. Both were A+	5	Umami	4.5
"This is the place for our weekly ""family sushi night"". The fish is always fresh, the specials rolls are yummy and the service is awesome. We do like to try other sushi restaurants, but this is our ""sushi home"".

Our favs: Cucumber Island, Salmon Roe Sushi, Philadelphia Roll, Final Fantasy's, Taste Like My X-Girlfriend"	5	Sushi Loca	3.5
A romantically, relaxing dining experience topped off with some delicious food and yummy drinks. I love the outdoor dining option, next to a fountain that contributes to a tranquil feeling. Must try selections: Bacon Wrapped Dates, Spicy Ahi Tuna, Goat Cheese and Fig Crostinis.	5	Embers	4
"One word... YUMMY! Awesomely unique rolls and super fresh sushi. The price? Comparable to other sushi restaurants. Highly recommend the S&H Special!

One tip: if ordering hot sake, ask them to heat it up more a bit. It's usually served more on the tepid side."	4	Sushi Bomb	4
A little different from the Pho style, this is Japanese, very good, many topping choices. Only the service and friendliness can use some work. I felt like there was no time allowed to relax and enjoy,..it was eat and Go....	3	Monta Ramen	4
Having eaten Pho in various places I can say by now this was certainly the best I had in many years. Pho Ga, so good and big portions. I little more expensive as your average price. Open 24 hours. I will be back.	4	Pho Kim Long	3.5

"Definitely a to go to place if you like Thai and even more if you like spicy. They know their hot peppers ;) The food is just plainly amazing. I had the Tom yum Gai and Panang curry, the soup was perfect, not greasy and very flavorful. The Panang was delicious. But my favorite in the curries is the 3 curries 
WATCH OUT! This place can be very addictive. I'm used to spicy and had asked for a 5 thai spicy it's hot but edible. But it had a good zing for minutes... It's worth visiting. I'll be back for sure."	4	Le Thai	4
"This is really a true gem in Las Vegas. If you want to feel like you are in Japan without leaving the US, this is the place to be. Great tasty food, very fast and very friendly service and all 100% Japanese style. I LOVE IT. 
I tried the sushi, skewers and fried rice but you can indulge into very typical Japanese dishes. I challenge you to decipher the original menu :)  even the interior as simple as it is still reflects an original atmosphere. 
I will certainly recommend this place. And. I will be back for sure."	4	Ichiza	4
Great 911 roll if you like spicy. The oh my god roll is very tasty too. THe interior is very Japanese like, low floor tables and bamboo, nice atmosphere, friendly service	4	Osaka Japanese Bistro	4
Great pho, very fresh and huge portions. Certainly worth trying. The interior is a little cafeteria like, but the food makes up for it. Service could be friendlier	4	Pho So 1	3.5
Nice and clean place for sandwiches and breakfast delights. The sandwiches are great and fresh. My favorite is the hot chocolate made with real milk they even offer choices of milk to make it	4	AmeriBrunch Cafe	4.5
Very close to real Mexican food, and very cheap, very popular, we went there a few times in a row, there is always space available but always busy. Great choice when you are on a budget. They have some medium spicy salsas to dress it all up with :)	4	Roberto's Taco Shop	3
This was my first visit to Mezzo Bistro, and I will not be in a hurry to return. I ordered the Chicken Piccata, it would have been ok except the chicken was thick with black pepper. And the black pepper was not completely cracked so it was like getting  large pepper seeds in my mouth and it ruined the dish. The service was bad, I saw good service in the next station, but did not get any myself. When the bill came, it was wrong and we had to have him correct it, which he did grudgingly.	2	Mezzo Bistro and Wine	4
"Yes, it's true but so weird. A nice upscale steakhouse in Circus Circus... I came here with my friends for a bachelor party dinner without the actual bachelor (don't ask). So if you saw a bunch of awesome guys in suits walking by your kids holding their carnival prize stuffed animals, that would have been us.

This place had everything I would expect from a great steak house. The decor is dimly lit very upscale. The staff is very formal and polite. What's also interesting is that the kitchen is actually in the middle of the seating area so you can see the chefs preparing all the food.

The rib-eye I ordered was huge and perfectly cooked medium rare. It had been aged and the taste was amazing. And unlike some other steak houses, the entrees come with salad and your choice of sides. The garlic mash potatoes were delicious."	4	THE Steak House	4
The first time I visited the Bootlegger Italian Bistro, I was not impressed. But because the music was someone that I wanted to hear, I decided to try it a second time. I had the fettuccine Alfredo with Shrimp.The 4 shrimp were over cooked and like rubber. The Alfredo sauce was pretty tasteless and lacking seasoning. The drinks were good, but getting a refill on my water glass was a real chore. I will not be going back!	2	The Bootlegger Italian Bistro	4
I tried this BBQ today at lunch for the first time and will not be going back. I ordered the tri tip ribs, french fries and slaw. The slaw was ok, the french fries were loaded with black pepper and the tri tips were inedible. The tips were so tough that I could barely get any meat off them. There were a couple in the bottom that were not just tough, but also stringy like shoe leather. I ended up throwing the entire meal in the garbage and walking out.	1	H&H BBQ Plus 2	3.5
A friend and I ate breakfast this morning at the Bacon Bar for the first time. Half way through my hash browns I found a piece of metal which the waitress identified as a piece of a Brillo pad. I had eaten only a half dozen bites of my Italian scramble which I did not like, and stopped eating at that point. About an hour after leaving the restaurant, I came down with severe stomach cramps and many trips to the bathroom. I will not be returning to this place, even though the waitress was friendly and the service was fast.	1	Bacon Bar	3.5
"Okay, so it might not be the classiest or fancily extravagant like many buffets in Vegas, but it the selection is unbeatable! What other buffet that you know serves up Vietnamese pho with all the fixings? 

They've hit every cuisine from Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, a sushi bar, teppanyaki grill to order, Brazilian grill, Italian, to even a diner setup for hot dogs, burgers, fries, and make-your-own milkshakes.  And the sweetest part - a dessert station that has over 70 kinds of pies, cakes, pastries, and gelato.

What I go there for is the crab and shrimp. People bring heaps of them to their table with abundant amounts of melted butter and cocktail sauce. The crab legs are semi-cracked so they're easy to eat.  Rio buffet is always in my Las Vegas itinerary because it satisfies all my cravings!!

It might not be gourmet but if you want variety with average to above average quality, the selection is endless..."	4	Carnival World Buffet	3.5
I could care less when people talk about how crappy it is here. Yes it's far from your fancy strip restaurant but you wouldn't even entertain this option if that was what you were looking for. Victorian Cafe probably belongs in Fremont to be quite honest, but fond memories of curing after hours hunger pangs with $6.99 steak and eggs or $13.99 prime rib is enough to keep me coming back. It is dang busy during prime time 3am-5am, people stumble in from all directions. It is the stop you make post-club, before you go back to your hotel and sleep until noon the next day. The $6.99 steak and eggs comes with steak, albeit a thin steak that was probably tenderized with a meat hammer, 2 eggs, and toast. I prefer my steak medium rare and they always seem to get it right (haven't gotten sick; so far so good). Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the prime rib! It's juicy with a moderare fat, cooked right, comes with fries or a potato. At the Victorian, all of the servers are Asian and they even have a part of the menu that's dedicated to Asian cuisine. Either Asians are taking over or this place may be suffering from an identity crisis.	4	Victorian Cafe	3
"Stayed here for conference with my husband 7\/17\/16 to 7\/20\/16 (actually, I'm still in this god forsaken  hellhole writing this review with no escape due to the hour of the night and the fact that the room is prepaid) and I can't wait to leave. 

Upon check in after a long flight from NY, I waited in line to check in for ONE HOUR to check in. As I tried to find my room, I was tripping over children (yes, children sleeping in the floor and sitting at slots in the casino), and that was an experience. All of the elevators to get to your room are in the middle, that's right, the middle, of the casino.  

Upon entering the elevator (which anyone from the street can access as there is no security or any measures to keep people outside of the hotel from wandering around to your door), I was greeted with a stink of garbage, marijuana and old spilled beer--ugh. 

Upon entering my room, it appeared near, UNTIL I noticed something on the portrait in my room---a SEMEN STAIN from God known when.  I called
The desk, who sent me to the concierge, who did nothing. That was Sunday. 

Monday, stain still there even though cleaning person was in room (the who hotel is filthy, so who knows what's going on), so again, why she didn't see it, I don't  know. Inwas told by Hotel Manager 1 that it would be taken care of.  It wasn't.

Tuesday morning:!went to concierge who directed, and personally walked my husband and I to her.  She didn't believe us (we had photos, unfortunately) and suggested that maybe someone was paining a mounding and it dropped on the paining.  Umm, no!  She refused to take any responsibility or to make it right and said it would be taken care of immediately.  Since the room hadn't been clean yet, I figured ""okay"".  Nothing was done seven hours later. 

Tuesday afternoon, my husband went to complain (after I was left on hold for 45 minutes waiting to speak to a manager) and was told it would be taken care of. 

Tuesday evening: we return from a great night and find that the stain is now smeared on the painting, but there's 8 extra towels in the bathroom.  WHAT????  I decided to go down to the front desk at 9:15 (less than an hour ago) and clear this up.  I was told by WOODY (how apropos to my situation) that he will send someone up to clean it right then (at 9:30 pm, no!). I told him of how I spent a lot money in his hotel and could have stayed somewhere else better for less: example the ""Delano""). I told him how grossed out I was and he shrugged and said he and his girlfriend where in the same position last month and they were ""powerless"" too.  First of all: I don't care; secondly: then do better than what you had.  

It left off with him saying his hotel is too large to help everyone and that he has no control over house keeping.   I suggest that Woody read the want ads to find a job where he can pass the buck and be proud of the anarchy and jungle he is helping to build.  (Hey, he may be good for the DNC---kidding, sort of). 

Anyway, the real gem was his last statement to me "" You're leaving tomorrow anyway, so what difference does it make if you stay in the room one more?"". I'm sure Hooters and Motel 6 accords the street are cleaner and run better. 

Stay away! I wish Yelp didn't make me give a star, this place is in the negatives."	1	MGM Grand Hotel	3
Guinea pizza was good but not the best even if guy fiery says so.. the rebel is the way to go. Awesome beer selection.	5	Naked City Pizza On Paradise	3.5
My fiancee and I went there back in May when we were in Vegas. The food was incredible! The only downside was our service. We were both out of water for awhile and, despite the fact that there were server assistants walking by us with water pitchers and one looking right at us and our table as he walked by, we went about 15 minutes with nothing to drink.	3	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"Very, very good airport terminal restaurant.  I ordered three things and shared with my friend and I find the food is above my expectation (For an airport facilities) and price is not outrage too.

I really like their chicken fingers, steak fries and burgers were okay too.  

Chicken Caesar wrap was alright.  I wish the chicken tasted better. Can totally skip that one.  But burger is good value you get 1\/2 lb of angus meat with choice of toppings (for a fee).

Great services.  One of the best airport pub.  Great place to kill time.

Now they need to add more cell phone charging stations, then it will be perfect."	4	Village Pub & Grill	3
"I didn't know this restaurant earned michelin star after I was about to review it.  We had a table right next to the water (basically having a high roller friend who gets her VIP access makes your experience better).

The service was decent but I wouldn't give it excellent.

We had seafood platter, which was good.  The steak that I had was OK, nothing remarkable.  I just feel everything is pretty average here.  For a Michelin star restaurant, they should've done better.

Steak...pretty average. I find better steaks in my neighborhood joint.
 
Other than the view...I dont' know what keeping me from coming back."	3	Daniel Boulud Brasserie	4
"Great All You Can Eat Sushi Joint in Vegas.

Located in a shopping plaza.  Easy to park.  

The restaurant is not too big but staffs are very efficient with orders.  During non-busy hours, you can actually eat longer than the regulated 60 mins but usually people are full before they hit an hour landmark.  

Fishes were fresh.  Make sure to check their daily specials!  I like their fresh scallop (its previously frozen, however) but still pretty good for AYCE standard.  Uni melts in your mouth as well.  Sweet shrimp is better than typical AYCE place too.  I also liked their salmon, yellowtail, amber jack, albacore sushi.  Their tempura shrimp and seaweed salad is good too.  One of the best I have had in the AYCE restaurant.  Thumbs up.   They also make pretty good rolls, including 1\/2 order rolls so for those who can't consume the whole spider roll, this is the place to go.

My only gripe for this place is that their sushi rice is bit on the firm side.  It wasn't  very ""sticky"" when I was there.  Maybe just one of the bad nights?  Their Ikura (Salmon Eggs) weren't that salty too so if you don't like fishy stuff, try to avoid that.  Other than that, its definitely worth to make a trip here if you are very hungry and loves sushi!"	4	Sushi Mon	4
"Wynn's Buffet beats other buffets on the strip hands down (In terms of quality and price variables).

I do believe their weekday lunch is a very good value ($23.95).  You get all those variety of meats and vegetables to choose from. The taste are decent to excellent for most.  My personal favorite is their grilled flank steak and seabass.  Its restaurant quality-like food!
Other items worth mention during lunch:  Chinese Chicken Salad (Replaced by Smoked Salmon Salad during dinner time). Soup station. 

Dinner starts at 3:30pm.  It includes the famous Alaska King Crab Legs, Prime Ribs, Jumbo Shrimp Cocktails, and more deserts to choose from including the made to order waffles and crepes.  Their seafood and hot food stations changes between lunch and dinner too.  

Service is attentive. I am quite happy with the service that they provided.  Its good to visit here again for lunch, or dinner, or if you can, sit from lunch TO dinner :P  But then you will have to workout extra hard after the visit from The Buffet."	5	The Buffet	3.5
"Location:  On the Strip, easy access for everyone. Valet parking available.

Service: Most people were friendly except our original server did not take care of us at all so another gentlemen took over and helped us out during our entire meal.

Ambiance: Totally casual. It feels like people are here to enjoy good food \/ wine.

Food:  
Rosemary Bread is yummmmmmy
Wollensky's Salad is a must-have!  So delicious (Especially Bacon crumb)
Oscar's Fillet is a must have as well! 
NY Steak is more lean
Cajun Ribeye is a bit weak on the flavors. I had better ones in Morton's Steak house
People said the Prime rib is good.  I didn't get to have.
I had cheesecake for dessert.  Although homemade, I feel something is lacking.

If you can, reserve a private dining room by the kitchen. Its fun to watch\/to be watched while eating!"	4	Smith & Wollensky	4
"I used to think LA got one of the Best Ramen places in town.  Opinions changed!!

Monta Noodle House for now got the BEST Tonkotsu Ramen Soup in town! 

I have tried the famous Ramen shop in LA, SF, and NYC.  This one is no doubt the  BEST.  Thick creamy soup with bald flavors.  Although I am not the fan of thin noodles but they managed to cook it right (Shinsengumi Hataka Ramen in Gardena can not get it right, so does the famous Ippudo in NYC).  I also LOVED their nitamago (soft broiled egg).  YUMMY (Look at the business photo that I placed)

This place is now on my official ""Must Visit"" place when coming to Sin City.  So Good!$!#$!$!  and they also accept credit cards :D"	5	Monta Ramen	4
"Seriously, Its not that impressive.  Up to a point that I don't even remember what the taste was right after when I walked out the restaurant.

The food is mediocre at best.  Nothing to be wowed about.  Service was average at best.

I don't know what the hype was about, but everyone in my party believed that it is just an OK place.  There are many more dining options in Vegas, try somewhere else."	3	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
"I had high tea at MO Tea Lounge this past weekend and had an overall nice experience.  You just simply proceed to the 23rd floor sky lobby and the tea room is right next to the check in counter.  The views by the window are simply breathtaking, although lack of wow factor.  The service are on the level of a true 5 stars experience - friendly, knowledgeable about their products yet professional, which is rare in Vegas hospitality industries.  I was pleased to see this level of service in Vegas.  

I give 4 stars because the service is 5 stars, however the food is 3 stars, thus 4 stars rating on average.

The high tea comes with choice extensive choices of tea and 3 trays of tea pastries (top layer of tea pastries, middle layer scones, and bottom layer with tea sandwiches).   The bottom try sandwich came with Salmon cucumber, Chicken curry, black forest ham, egg salad sandwich.  I was quite underwhelmed with the taste of the sandwhich.  The breads were dry and it taste is either too salty or no taste at all.   Black forest ham was the best of all but still not remarkable. 

The scones in the middle are the best along with their strawberry ruhburb jam.  

Their desserts were disappointing, too.  The macaroon looks nice but the taste (Vanilla & Strawberry) did not impress me at all.  It was just pure sweet, their chocolates were quite average too. Lemon lavender cake was really sweet, I guess that can go with the tea well.  My favorite was the pistacho mousse with strawberry jam, but still that was very sweet at all.  For the name of the MO high tea, they still have quite some way to go.  There is no comparison to their sister property, MO Bangkok High tea.

I am also sad to see that they will discontinue with the refill service with their high tea.  Next time when having high tea in Vegas, I will venture out to different options."	4	Tea Lounge	4
"For now, this is my favorite place in Las Vegas.

They have changed back to the old name Tabelau.  So I will finish my review there."	5	Tower Suite Cafe	4.5
"I don't understand all the negative comments about this place.  Services are good, seats are comfortable, and the best of all, the foods are GREAT here!

I often find Vegas restaurants overpriced.  This restaurant, tends to be on the pricey side too but if you know where to get the coupon, it can be one of the best hidden secret on Las Vegas Blvd, and they open 24 hours (However, coupon only works from 4pm to midnight daily).

I tried many of their dishes, from breakfast items, famous Reuben Sandwiches with Marble Bread (Yummy), Grilled Ribeye steak, Fried Honey Chicken...All of them exceeded my expectation.  

The Best food here, however is their Chinese food. I always came dinner\/midnight hours so your experience may varied.  Their Asian (Chinese) food are AWESOME.  I came from LA, which is known to have tons Asian\/Chinese restaurants.  This place, oh man, beats 90% of the restaurants in LA area.  Its SO GOOD.  Their Roast Duck, Fried Rice, Singapore Noodle, Chicken Lettuce Wrap.   YUMMM... I wish we can have a place that serve this type of quality Chinese food in LA!

Please try this place out, its worth a visit!"	5	Planet Dailies	3
"Its really good, I was doubtful because of its location and because there are so many choices in Las Vegas and wow, this place is amazing.  I know the line is long but its definitely worth the 1 hour-ish wait.  After our first try, we came here three night in a row to have more of the amazing food.

This is definitely nothing fancy as Guy Savoy, but it is definitely authentic Southern style seafood.  I love this type of no frill food joint.  Just good food without the expensive tag.  During our visits, I tried most of the items on the menu.

First off, you get to pick level 1 to 10 for your food's spicyness.  I go for 1 or 0 simply because I dont' like spicy food.

The dinner roll is complimentary, and it is the standard sourdough roll, served warm with butter.

Their Clam Chowder is actually not that good, too powdery taste. I don't know why others liked it, I didn't.  Not enough clam in it too.  I like Boudin's Clam Chowder better when compare to similiar level.

Their Bouillabaisse is good, you can choose between rice or noodle, it is tomato based soup with all of the seafoods (Lobster, Crab, Shrimp, Clams, Mussels, Fish..etc), which is their #2 signature item.

#1 most popular item is their combo roast.  It is thicker in terms of broth, but it goes really well with rice.  You get to pick your favorite toppings but combo roast comes with shrimp, crab, and lobster, which is better in my opinion than the Palace Roast (with chicken).  Its little bit spicy for me but the bold taste of the seafood is one of the best I had for years.

My personal favorite goes to the Shrimp Scampi with Pasta.  Its the clam soup with melted butter and loads of tiger shrimp.  Its so heavenly.  I would order extra noodle next time when I go to satisfy my crave.

Tip: There's no tip as in when the lines will be shorter, its really your luck but the chef really matters alot.  Even the materials\/ingredients are all the same, but chef really made the difference.  During our 3 visits, this fat chef whose always happy did the best job.  His shrimp scampi is out of this world yet another chef always seems piss at something...did a very sloppy job, my scampi was dry and soup-less.  Good luck waiting and don't lose too much money on slots while waiting in line!"	5	Oyster Bar	4.5
"I second Rod U's review. This is certainly the best restaurant in Las Vegas. Not your typical California Roll\/Philadelphia Roll place. No All You Can Eat.  All you get is pure high quality freshest fish delivered fresh from Japan onto table without paying the astronomical prices.

If you like Americanized\/Korean style sushi, don't come here.  If you are into AUTHENTIC Edomae sushi, come here.  I usually do not recommend people to try Omakase but here I highly suggest people ordering Omakase so that way you can let the chef introduce you the rare fishes from Japan.

The food itself is gorgeous.  From the cutting and display you can tell the owner have very high expectation with the overall presentation.  The food itself did not disappoint.  The proportion between sushi rice and fish were good and the rice were perfectly seasoned so it did not overpower the taste of fish.

If you have any questions with the fish on menu, feel free to ask the chef.

Reservation is highly recommended."	5	Kabuto	4.5
"50% Discounts for Locals + Elite Line for Total Rewards 7 Stars, Diamond & Platinum members  = big bargin for us.

However, the food, SUCKS :P

They do have huge selections for the buffet but the ones that are worth eating are very , very few.

If you are looking for something to fill your stomach up, this is the place to go.   but if you want something tasty? I would go other places

They do have seafood (Crab legs, Shrimp Cocktails), Noodle Bars (Asian Noodles), Mogolian Beef ( I like the Mogolian Shrimp the most).  and some craved station, italian pasta stations..etc  Desserts have good spread but it all tasted like supermarket quality type of food. 

If you have buffet of buffets pass, you should come to try it out to see what's the hype about.  If not, it doesn't worth all the drive over there."	3	Carnival World Buffet	3.5
"Last day in Vegas so figured that Vegas has a lot of good Italian since there not much back home. Through yelp, found this place. Gave it a try. It was lunch hour when we arrived so the restaurant was busy. We had spaghetti meatballs, rigatoni and I ordered crazy alfredo. While waiting for our order we were served with garlic breads. It was unusual as it was the first. Normally restaurants would give you a plain bread with butter or some kind of dipping while waiting. 
Loved loved the garlic breads. It was cut into a bite sized and it was yummy and crispy. Not long afterwards came our menu. Mine sure look a lot lol...it's crazy alfredo with chicken, bell peppers, shrimp minus the sausage. It was rich and creamy...gosh....I'm in pasta heaven...it sure a class of its own. Kudos for the chef who cooked my yummy pasta. Halfway I was full but I know I gotta finish and savor it as I won't be able to taste it again in the near future. So I made it and licked the plate clean. Before we left we ordered cannoli. It's been a while since we had it in New York and yeah a big giant cannoli answered our prayer. It was filled with chocolate chips on one side and pistachios on the other. It was enough to fill all of us. Yeah...we left with a full belly and happy smiles
Thank you Vegas for the great food we had it beat all that expensive buffets that being served everywhere in those casinos esp bellagio. They got a very bland Asian dishes. Only good for steak and desserts...urrgghhh..."	5	Nora's Italian Cuisine	4

"Came hare couple of nights earlier when i was in vegas . Was looking for an italian restaurant to try and wahla....found this one on yelp. The price seems reasonable and it has good review. Anyway, my yelp searches based mostly on my intuition of the pictures sent by the reviewers. Like how Andrew Zimmermern said it ""if it looks good, eat it"" so yeah...

When we came the restaurant was basically empty and only had one table occupied. Heard it was a slow week in Vegas. We were greeted by the server who was nice and friendly. Was shown couple of ""extra menu"" and menu of the day together with the pricing. Great we dont want to eat and suddenly got blinsided with the price that left us in debt for the rest of the month. After much consideration, i choose Squid ink pasta with sauteed shrimp and squid...sounds good to me.

While waited, we were given 2 huge breadsticks with a dipping of marinara sauce and a goat cheese. It dint take long before we got our order. It looks yummy...yum yum...and as i took my first bite, its indeed was delicious! tell you, this is my first time trying squid ink pasta as they are very rare for you to see part of the menu on any so called italian restaurant and gosh...this pasta was something else. They cooked it al dente..has a nice bite to it and the lobster sauce was creamy and tasted delicious together with the shrimp and squid they had a good chew to them. I was enjoying my dinner every minute of it..knowing this will be my first and last before i leave vegas.

Like i said, service was great, the server would asked me and my partner if they was anything we need and i felt i being acknowledged. Most of the times they would just ignored me and would just asked my partner as if im invisible. Here's the tip for all the server out there, it might seems you guys forgot whose the boss here haha....my partner might be paying the meal but im the one who made the decision where to eat. so if i dont like your service you guys probably wont get our business in the future haha....

anyway, the dinner was out of this world and we left happy with all that was offered and here's the thing with so much restaurants to choose from on the strip there are alot of italian restaurants that are pretty reasonable in price and still has a damn great menu. Im definitely will come back to this place again the next time im in vegas."	5	D. Vino	3.5
"1st off: to the review posted 28 days before this...are you kidding?? You complain everything here is ""fake meat#?!?!?!? It's funny and incredibly ironic that you obviously know yelp but even better that you actually review the restaurant afterward complaining it's fake meat! Maybe you should use yelp to gain insight on the restaurant before you go rather than using yelp to complain about a place that only serves ""fake meat"". What is wrong with people?!? 

Very cute restaurant is a strip mall in an Asian district (we saw thai, Japanese and Chinese places). We found this place on yelp and decided to try it out as me and the SO are vegetarians. The restaurant is hard to see up on the 2nd floor from the parking lot entrance...

We ordered pick up and it was already waiting for us when we got there. Price was great for the amount of food we got. Sweet and sour chicken had some odd chewy pieces (maybe trying to replicate real chicken dishes?) General tso's wad great as well as the spring rolls. 

Food was hot and well packaged to go. Restaurant had super cute decor.

Lady who helped us was really nice.

Knocked that 1 star off because of the chewy pieces in the sweet and sour (about 10% of them) but we will be back.

I'd recommend...good vegetarian cuisine with cheap prices and good ambience."	4	Veggie House	4.5
Decided to take a small vecation to las vegas.  The hooters hotel was an all right choice.  The rooms aren't all that great.  The elevators are very slow,but its not like you will be staying in the room while there.  The good side of this casino is that the odds of you winning are better then other casinos (6 to 2 ).  They have a pool area with two large pools and conecting outdoor bar.  For those that like to keep in shape and active, the hotel also has a indoor gym with the news workout equipment.  But the best perk is getting the free rewards card and using it to accumulate points which in return can be used to by hooters Mech, or eat free into hooters restraunts	3	Hooters Casino Hotel Las Vegas	2.5
"The sister and I were looking for a brunch place to stop in and found this place on yelp. The line was crazy long. We waited over an hour before we got ourselves a booth. We took this as a good sign for some good eating. Our server was very friendly and funny. He took care of us well even though it was a full house.

CRISPY SALMON- fresh salmon cornmeal friend on a wheat bun with lettuce, tomato, and red onion all trimmed with chili mayo, served with fries
The sister ordered this and I was disappointed with the way it tasted. It was bland. The salmon was overcooked and dried. I was hoping for it to retain its moisture, but sadly it was so dry and flavorless that one bite was enough for me. The fries weren't flavored nor were they crisp. Overall this dish was a disappointment and disgusting.

GRIDDLED FRENCH TOAST- dipped in a banana cinnamon cream with pecans and maple syrup, served with eggs and potatoes
The french toast was a bit chewy and didn't have much flavor on its own, but when eaten with the banana there was some sweetness.  The potatoes were dry and unseasoned, but liked that they didn't overcook the eggs. The cinnamon cream was my favorite part of the whole dish. It was light and creamy.

I'm going to give this place a second try because it was crazy packed and I know people don't stand in line for mediocre food. I will be returning and ordering other things. Don't fail me again!"	2	Hash House A Go Go	4
"Eating at the one in Bellagio wasn't enough. I had to come here and eat some more! It looked so cute here as well. It felt more spacious here than at the Bellagio. They had the same pastries for the same prices, but there was no line. 

TIRAMISU- coffee kahlua biscuit, mascarpone mousse, and chocolate pearls
This was one of the best tiramisu I've ever had. I really like the taste of the coffee kahlua. It added a nice liqueur flavor. The mascarpone mousse was smooth and light. I especially found the chocolate pearls so delightful because they added a nice crunch in contrast to the smoothness of the mousse. 

I definitely recommend coming here if you want the same pastries for no wait. It's literally in the casino area of Aria; so you could either people watch or partake in the gambling as well."	5	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
"My boyfriend and I were looking up sushi places back at the hotel and decided to go to this one because of the high reviews. I've never been to an all you can eat sushi place before, but I've had some real good high quality sushi and a lot of yelpers said they have fresh sushi; so I had to give them a try.

It was near midnight and there were a few groups. We didn't have to wait, we sat at the sushi bar. I was real excited for the AYCE menu. We ordered a variety of sushi and sushi rolls. The sushi didn't taste fresh and the rice was hard and dry. It tasted as if they used regular rice instead of sushi rice. The sushi rolls were nothing spectacular. They were very simple and was not worth it.

I don't think I do very well at AYCEs. I was expecting really fresh fish, but they didn't deliver on quality. I'm beginning to think Las Vegas restaurants are overhyped. I've been to a few with high reviews, but they've only disappointed.

For the same price I could eat a simpler, but fresher sushi meal elsewhere. Our server was friendly and attentive, but the sushi chefs looked arrogant and rude. They didn't talk to us much and we ordered some sushi rolls from them, but they didn't seem happy and even frowned as us. 

For some reason, I don't usually give second chances if my experience was horrible, but I want to come back when I'm in town; so I can see what this place has to offer. Perhaps it was a mishap, perhaps they do suck. Only a second visit will tell."	1	Umiya Sushi	4
"My first visit to Las Vegas was almost like a culture shock. I highly enjoyed my stay here and the first place I stopped to grab something to eat was Olives. My boyfriend has gone here before and wanted me to try it out. Our server was very friendly, but he disappeared every now and then. I didn't hold it against him because it was really packed that day.

PAN SEARED ATLANTIC SALMON- wild rice, sautéed asparagus, cognac beurre blanc, and micro insalata
This dish was flavorful and fresh. I liked the sear on the salmon, it added a nice crisp and sweetness to the fish and the beurre blanc was very savory and creamy. The wild rice was a bit plain. It tasted bland. When eaten with the salmon, it was okay, but I only wish for it to have a little more flavor.

STEAK FRITES- grilled flat iron, tuscan fries, port glaze, and frisee greens
This dish wasn't all that great. The steak was a bit dry and tough. The port glaze was the best thing about this dish, but there was only a little spread on the plate. I really liked the greens because it added a nice refreshing earthy taste to the steak. The fries could've been seasoned better because they just tasted like regular potatoes.

BANANA TIRAMISU- banana mascarpone cream, banana cake, chocolate sauce, and kahlua sabayon
This was the best dish during the whole dining experience. I have an obsession with tiramisu and have never tried a banana tiramisu. It was divine! It was so creamy and moist. I could really taste the bananas, but they weren't overwhelming. You could still taste the tiramisu and the liqueur. It felt so light; yet so rich with flavor.

Olives really provided a nice view of the Bellagio fountain and you could see the other casinos on the strip. I would come here again if I came back to Vegas."	3	Olives	4
"This was our last spot before heading back to the airport. We drove about 30 mins to get here and I was expecting something amazing because of the high reviews. Yelp you failed me! Our server was very friendly, but she took forever to get our orders. 

We both ordered the PHO DAC BIET and it was nothing special. The broth wasn't flavorful and tasted bland. The meat was chewy and didn't taste fresh. Did I get bad luck and go on the wrong day? It can't be that everyone was wrong. Nevertheless, I won't be coming back to try my luck again. I'm sure there are other pho restaurants that can be more consistent and more flavorful."	1	Pho Aimie	4
"One of the few restaurants in Vegas that lived up to its hype. My boyfriend and I wanted to find a nice italian restaurant and came here for lunch. The interior decor is romantic and has a modern rustic italian vibe. We were immediately seated by the hostess and our server came to explain the menu to us. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. 

CARPACCIO DI MANZO- thinly sliced prime sirloin, arugula salad, shaved parmigiano cheese, and truffle oil
Our server recommended this appetizer and it was amazing! The meat was sliced so thinly and it was so fresh and I loved the earthiness of the arugula and the creaminess of the cheese. The truffle oil added a nice creamy and savory touch to the dish. The lemon was a nice addition to the meat as well because it provided a nice tangy acidity. 

SPAGHETTI VONGOLE E POMODORINI- homemade spaghetti with clams, olive oil, garlic and cherry tomatoes
This dish was very fresh. There were plenty of clams and the spaghetti was cooked perfectly. I only wished that there was more flavor. The olive oil didn't provide much flavor and I tasted a hint of garlic. The cherry tomatoes added a nice sweetness to the dish, but it wasn't enough to coat the whole dish. 

SALMONE GRIGLIATO ALLA CHECCA
Salmon grilled with Fresh Tomatoes, Basil, Fresh Garlic and Kalamata Olives
This dish was very flavorful and saucy. I especially liked the home made sauce and the cherry tomatoes because it added an extra layer of acidity. The salmon was cooked nicely and tasted very buttery and tender. The rigatoni pasta was soft and flavorful.

TIRAMISU- classic italian dessert made with lady fingers, mascarpone cheese & espresso
This dish came out beautifully and it tasted as great as it looked. It was creamy and moist and I especially liked the strong espresso flavor. The lady fingers were soft and soaked up all the flavor and the mascarpone cheese was so creamy.

i definitely want to come back here when I'm in town. They have such great service, the food is fantastic, and it's such a cute place to go to on a date."	4	Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar	4
"The first night we landed in Vegas, my sister and I were wandering the strip together and decided to grab a late dinner here. It was near midnight, but it was pretty packed when we got here. Our server was friendly and took care of us well even though she disappeared from time to time.

CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS- minced sauteed chicken breast and vegetables in an asian sauce served with cool lettuce wraps
This dish didn't taste that flavorful to me. The sauteed chicken breast had a weird flavor. It didn't taste asian at all. The chicken was dry and all the flavor combos didn't complement each other. It was so strange and not even in a complex interesting way.

GRAND FRIED CALAMARI- with fried rock shrimp, zucchini and onions served with dipping sauces
The batter on the calamari wasn't even crispy. The calamari was soggy and chewy. The dipping sauces were nothing spectacular. They just added some much needed saltiness to the dish. 

Like the one star says, ""eek! Methinks not."" I'll pass. I guess I'll stick to eating casino chips because I have yet to find a really good restaurant on the strip."	1	Grand Lux Cafe	4
Dud an Uber Eats pick up and grabbed a piece of the taftoon bread. Absolutely delicious and super cheap at $1.66. Staff was really friendly!	4	Fresh Kabob	4
"After watching Gordon Ramsay on his shows, I had to come and try out this place myself. There was a line and we waited about under an hour. There's a huge menu outside; so it's good to get a glimpse of what they have to offer so you don't have to wait and waste time once you've got a table.

FISH AND CRISP SANDWICH- ale battered cod, salt and vinegar crisps, and fresh dill tartar sauce
When I first saw it, it looked so good, but when I bit into it, it was bland and could've used more seasoning. The tartar sauce didn't do it much either. The cod tasted fresh, but lacked flavor. It had a nice crunch and consistency, but that was about it.

HELL'S KITCHEN BURGER- asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomato
I liked this burger. It was perfectly cooked and juicy. It tasted like a typical burger, but a burger done right. There were no bold flavors that stood out, but if you're craving for a burger then I would recommend this one because you got the melted cheese, the heat from the peppers, the creaminess from the avocado and the acidic juicy tomato all with the perfectly cooked patty.

CHANTERELLE BURGER- chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, and figgy-onion jam
This burger was earthy. The mushrooms and the arugula were very pre-dominant in this burger. I didn't enjoy it too much. It was okay, but a bit strong for my taste. The burger itself was not dry, but could've used more seasoning or another flavor profile.

SWEET POTATO FRIES- vanilla powdered sugar, honey, and jalapeno mayo
If you love sweet potatoes then these fries are for you! These fries had a nice outer crisp and sweetness to it because of the powdered sugar. The jalapeno mayo didn't add much heat to the fries, but there are different layers of sweetness.

BEER BATTERED MAUI ONION RINGS- parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, and cheddar ranch dip
I did not like the onion rings at all. They were so dry and almost flavorless. It says they use beer batter, but I didn't taste anything. What a huge disappointment! The serving was huge, but after one bite, it was left the way it was.

TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES- hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, and truffle aioli
You could really taste the truffles in these fries. They had such a strong taste and I love it! You could smell it and definitely taste it. Truffle has such a crisp taste, but if you only put a little in it's very subtle; so they must have put a butt load because it was so strong.

Overall, the burgers here were okay. I was expecting more flavors because of the price, but then again it is Vegas; so expect mediocre food for inflated prices."	3	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
My first buffet! I really love the decor. Everything is so cute and floral. I love all the bright and vibrant colors. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and it wasn't too packed. Every buffet has their own style and their own signature food. Here, it's the desserts. The various options that they have here are abundant, but nothing really stands out from other buffets except the freshness. The flavors are not overwhelming or wowing, but they do have some good things. I got a little bit of everything, from the pasta, meats, crabs, veggies, sushi, and desserts. It's a buffet! Time to splurge..	3	The Buffet	3.5
"Thank goodness for the other location in Aria. The wait here is dreadful and long. The lines don't move fast enough especially when the line wraps around the beautiful displays of pastries. Such a tease! This shop is cuter in style than the one in Aria because it has the famous chocolate fountain, but it's smaller and more cramped.

The first time I saw this little pastry shop it was love at first sight. Everything looked so darn cute, but there was always a line. The boyfriend and I decided to ride the line and after 20 mins we were able to make an order.

EXOTIC CREPE- pineapple, mango, passion fruit, and coconut sorbet
I was really surprised by the way the crepe came out at first because I was so used to the ones in Houston where the crepes are filled with all the fruits, but this crepe had all the fruits on top of the crepe instead of inside it. The crepe was a nice soft texture and the fruits provided a nice tart flavor. I liked the sweet creamy coconut sorbet most. 

CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRIES
The strawberries weren't sweet, but sour and the chocolate was really sweet. The white chocolate was too sweet for my liking and the dark chocolate would've tasted better with the strawberry if the strawberry wasn't too sour. 

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll head over to Aria instead of waiting in the long lines here, but it doesn't hurt to look at all the pretty displays they have on the way out."	4	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
"My second time in Vegas and my friend recommended us to go to the buffet at Cosmopolitan. My sis and I were standing in line for lunch and we made it in for the price of lunch, but we stayed for the dinner menu. I guess we got ourselves a discount? Either way, it was worth it. The interior looked modern with decor of abstract shapes spewed about on the ceiling and walls.

The had a nice variety of food. My sister and I kept going back and grabbing more and more of everything. The quality of their food is very fresh as well and seasoned so perfectly. There was so much to choose from and we stayed there for almost 3 hours because we didn't want to leave. The only thing I didn't like here was the selection of desserts. There were few choices and it seemed like everything had to do with chocolate.

Our server was so friendly and they were going through a shift change; so we got another server and she was so nice too! Everything transitioned so smoothly with the food and the service."	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"The boyfriend and I were walking around the strip and visiting every casino to see what the theme was and felt a bit hungry mid way and decided to grab some food while we were here because it was close by.

I ordered a chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered a panini. They both were really dry and even though there was mayo in them they're weren't spread correctly; so a lot of bites were just of bread and chicken. The veggies were old and were beginning to wilt. It didn't taste fresh.

We also ordered a cup of stracciatella gelato. It was good and creamy, but the consistency was a bit thin and was already melting even though it was in the freezer.

For the prices, the food is not worth it. I would wait til dinner next time before I stop somewhere and eat something."	1	Palio Pronto	3.5
"Upon entering, I noticed all the papers on the walls with signatures of famous kpop stars and korean celebrities. That was a good sign because I assumed that they visited and gave the a-ok. Our server wasn't very friendly and she ignored us a few times. She disappeared after she dropped everything off.

The side dishes were nothing grand. There wasn't one that I liked in particular, but the potato salad and the greens were okay. I was disappointed in the kimchi. I wish it was more flavorful.

We ordered 3 different types of meat, one pork and two beef. I've tasted better. There was nothing spectacular about these meats. They didn't taste fresh. I wish there was something more to it, but it was just slices of meat. 

If it was my first time I would've given 3 stars, but I've eaten at really good korean restaurants and this is not one of them. The service and the food are sub par; so I'll stick to the other restaurants."	2	Dae Jang Keum Korean BBQ & Tofu Restaurant	3
Decent product. ..HORRIBLE service. Totally unprofessional.  Would NEVER spend one red cent here.  They almost ruined my wedding day....buyer beware!!!!	1	CakesbyToi	1.5
Our server Raul was great! He was courteous..kept the refills coming without asking and was very friendly with my son.  Great service and great food is a winning combo!	5	Egg & I	4.5
This is my #1 favorite bar\/restaurant in Vegas. Happy hour is truly the best. The bartenders really know their liquor history. The truffle Mac &Cheese is a must have along with the donuts.	5	Herbs & Rye	4
"Nice breakfast, just ok dinner.  Partly my fault for ordering salad with easy on the dressing.  But the lettuce was ice cold and not crisp.  The reason for keeping lettuce ice cold is to crisp it after a wash.
But the one thing to really point out is please dont ask us to voice our room number and name.  Take a cue from the front desk clerks, who point to your room number and they talk a little softer.  On the surface, the wait staff are being personable and friendly, but then act a little offended when my sweetheart (with a hotel security background) asks to write it down instead of announce it to the room.  Maybe no one is listening, but he's barring on the safe side."	3	Beach Café	3
Had dinner here last night.  The Bagel Cafe is very clean and inviting.  The server was very good and accommodating.  I ordered the steak dinner with baked potato.  The dinner also came with a side salad, roasted vegetables and later coffee and dessert.  The steak was just as I ordered it, the side salad was a good size and excellent, not just lettuce, the best side salad I have had anywhere.  Baked potato was perfectly done, but my favorite part was the roasted vegetables of asparagus, Brussels sprouts, carrots and green beans.  I was so happy the vegetables were not the usual zucchini with other overcooked generic vegetables.  This is my new favorite place.  Delish!	5	The Bagel Cafe	4
Awful.  Read the reviews and thought this would be a good place to try Korean food for the first time.  Not only was the food awful, I had to hurry home because I became very sick, and cramping up.  The worst part was the price.  Their website says lunch is $18.  Come to find out, it is only $18 during the week.  Saturdays is $28 for lunch.   I won't be back, or recommend.	1	Sura BBQ Buffet	3.5
"I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay and was excited to discover the restaurant, I got the farm house burger. It was pretty good, maybe my expectations were a little high.

"IDK why people are complaining about the service. we were welcomed and treated very nice by the crew. It was great to find a halal restaurant in the strip. 
The food was good. We ordered chicken biriyani-a great option and kebab was okay, but the sauce (gravy) it came with it was so bomb!"	4	Kabob N More	3.5
Delicious!  The pork belly was so crispy and the skin doesn't separate from the meat so you get crispy goodness with every bite.  The pig ears were also delicious, crunchy and smokey and perfect to go with our wonton soup with duck.  Makes me want to live in Las Vegas.	5	Asian BBQ & Noodle	4
"My colleagues and I had a three-day business conference in Vegas and at the end of day three, we were exhausted and hungry. We were staying in the north end of the Strip so I suggested ramen and everyone was game.

It was the PERFECT last meal of the trip. We went at 9:30 pm in our yoga pants to get our food to go. I got the Spicy Tonkatsu. My colleagues got the Miso and Shoyu. Our to-go containers had noodles in one container and the broth in another. Everything was tightly sealed - no spills on the way back to the hotel. They gave us spoons, forks and chopsticks.

And we all DEVOURED our bowls. The spicy had a little kick - I would call it a mild-medium. I haven't had much ramen in my life and I now understand why so many of my friends CRAVE it. Especially when it was as good as this was. We all had Ramen bellies in the morning.

Parking is a little tricky - it is a small lot with a lot of busy restaurants. Be patient! It's worth it! Next time I go - I want to get bubble tea from the tea shop two doors down, too."	5	Monta Ramen	4

Cheap NY style pizza. About 4 bucks a slice depending on topping. Had pepperoni, pepperoni and jalapeño, spinach pizza (very garlicky but tasty).  In Ellis island Casino where people watching is a special treat. No gourmet here, but perfect for the late night munchies.	4	Metro Pizza	3.5
This place is so delicious! I don't think I'll ever be able to have fish and chips anywhere else again. I had the 3 fish combo with dirty#2 (truffles and parmesan) chips with European Mayo, and tartar sauce for dipping. I never knew something so simple could be so amazing! Portions are filling, everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Breading on fish was light and flavorful, chips we're crisp on the outside while being soft and fluffy inside. I'll make sure to make this a regular stop whenever I visit Vegas.	5	Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips	4
While searching for Peruvian food nearby, Aroma came up so we wanted to give it a try. It was quiet and near closing time on a Sunday night which was great for us. Food was prepared quickly and we had the pleasure to meet and speak with chef Oscar. We ventured out of our comfort zones to try the black ink squid, which can be an acquired taste at first but easier to enjoy when chef says the ink is shipped from Spain, I would say it's a delicacy. He receives so many fresh produce from other countries, including the delicious peppers that were in our Lomo Saltado. Chef Oscar is very passionate about the art of cooking and you can tell he wants to improve in every way possible. He loves teaching children about eating healthy and customizes his dishes to be a delicious, healthy option. I look forward to returning for flamenco and salsa classes!	4	Aroma Cuisine of the World/Oscar Catering	5

"It use to be better, bigger, tastier, but now it's just a sad, faded image of it's former self. 

I've always made a point to visit Earl of Sandwich on every Vegas trip in the past. But in recent trips, the sandwiches got smaller, the amount of meat sadder... 

I know the economy took a hit, but I wouldn't have mind paying extra to keep the up the quality of each sandwich. I heard they opened up a new store in Disney. I'm hesitant to go and try, even though I'm just around the corner."	3	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"It was my first time trying this place. We were on our way out from a weekend of fun. The chicken fingers proved to be the best choice for eating in the long car ride back home. 

The staff was nice, and the place was very clean. 

Their chicken fingers were perfectly cooked and lightly breaded. And their dipping is freaking awesome, so awesome that the charge for them. :["	4	Raising Cane's	4
A great place to start your night! Atmosphere is great, the food is average. There are self serve kegs, dart boards and flat screens. But the best thing about this place is their beer challenge! If you can drink a pint of beer in 7 seconds, you'll get it for free!! Limited two times per night. But be warned, once you start, you might end up staying there the whole night.	4	Todd English P.U.B.	3.5
I used to work here. Let me tell everybody reading this. Don't ever ever go to this location. It's not clean. They use  rags to clean the bathroom then clean tables with the same rag. I remember a kid threw up and we had to mop it up, they then used the same mop to mop the floors during closing without disinfecting it. The soups aren't handmade they come frozen inside of bags! Same with the sauces. Brownies, cakes, etc are delivered. They leave the meat and ice cream out over night. Customers don't know this but there are a few mice here as well. My experience here sucked! I was happy to leave! I will never step foot inside this or any other Jason's deli ever again! Just think about this next time you come to this location. El arroyo crossings. If you value your health don't come here smh. Save yourself and your money and go to the chilis next door	1	Jason's Deli	3.5
I saw this restaurant highlighted on one of Anthony Bourdain show. Wifey and I went there during their lunch hour. There was no live music because it was still  considered lunch hours. The place was clean and orderly. I read some reviews about bad attitudes from the wait staff but I had no issues. I got the lunch portion which comes with a side of house or caesar salad. We got the baked Penni and Lasagna. They were both excellent. I will defiantly be returning but during dinner hours.	5	The Bootlegger Italian Bistro	4
"This was a tough review to write because I am torn between the crappy service and the great food. I come here each time when I go to Vegas Strip. The food is great but the servers have the attitude of ""you will come here anyway so I am going provide you with crappy service"". It just sucks cause the service has declined over the years. I would have given a higher rating if it was just food but I have to factor in the service.

On a more positive note, the frozen hot chocolate is the best. I recommend the deep fried Oreos sundae if your not a fan of frozen hot chocolate. I got the deep fried Twinkie which is good but the deep fried Oreo are better. Let's hope this place doesn't turn into a Margarita-Ville because it's heading that direction. Another small criticism is I wish their pickles were dill instead of sweet."	3	Serendipity 3	3
Where do I start? I will start when I saw a sign that read "Rated best ramen on LV strip". When I went there I had to wait for a table for a few minutes. Once I was sat I waited several more minutes and the wifey had to flag one of the workers down to take my order. After my food was ordered it came out fairly fast. I hate to admit I paid $2.50 for a 12 ounce can of Pepsi and another 15 for the ramen. The ramen was good but it just wasn't enough. Before I could finish my bowl of ramen one of the workers who ignored me initially came up and asked if I was ready to pay. It would have been nice for him to be "Johnny on the spot" to take my order. I finished my bowl of ramen and I was still hungry. I walked back to my hotel and bought some hotdog on a stick. I don't believe I should pay 15 bucks for a bowl of ramen and leave still hungry. High prices, unreasonable amount of food plus poor service will lead to just one star. I will continue my hunt for a better ramen place. Stay away! I don't know who rated this place as the best but more of a bust.	1	Ramen Ya Katana	3.5
I have been here every time I come into Vegas. It's a great place. I only eat breakfast and have never had any lunch or dinner items. The portions are hearty even for a chubby boy like me. The wait can be long at times but it's worth it. I am giving only four stars because I got the cold brew coffee that was advertised in a pint but I got it in a glass. I am also suspicious about it being made a cold brew and not being brewed hot and then chilled but who knows. Overall great place and should be on everybody's list for breakfast while on the strip.	4	Hash House A Go Go	4
Great place! I "Yelped" breakfast places on the strip because I had already eaten at the Hash House. This place came up so we stopped by it before we headed home. I am so glad we did. When we pulled in there was a line of people outside waiting. Despite the line we only waited 10-15 minutes to be seated. The menu was bigger than I thought. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs. I didn't take a picture of it normally because I was 3 or 4 bites deep before I realized I didn't take a picture. The portions were large and the food came out fast. The wifey said she loved the banana muffin. I didn't get it. I can't give an honest opinion about the muffin because I don't enjoy muffins. Back to the portions, they were so huge this chubby boy couldn't finish it. The potatoes were seasoned just right and not overly covered in seasoning. I am picky about my gravy and it compares well with my aunts gravy. This place is a no fluff breakfast joint. Highly recommended!	5	Egg & I	4.5
I was some what hesitant about eating here after reading the reviews but I am glad I went. The service was good. The server was patient and answered all my questions. The wait wasn't long and I was able to sit on the patio with the wifey. The food was good and I don't have any real complaints. We didn't wait long for our food and everything was hot. I don't understand all the bad reviews. I recommend it.	4	Bubba Gump Shrimp	3.5
"This was my first time here. I have dined at other Brazilian steak houses and wanted to check them out. 
My impression - a bit underwhelming. They advertise 16 types of meat. Our table saw maybe 7. At the ""other"" restaurant we have to constantly turn away the servers. Here we had to look for them. The salad bar was half of the size of the competition's and to say the least - rather bland. The managers visited our table more than the servers. Appeared to be understaffed. Try the other one after visiting here and you may just agree with me. 

At this price point you expect more and better than the others. I will return however- but only because the ""other"" competitor is not in my home town. They are still good - just not great."	3	Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse	4.5
Had the cilantro salad with tofu.  Was pretty good and healthy.  I was really annoyed with the rock n roll music they had blasting obnoxiously.  Would go back and try the veggie burger	4	Vegeway	3.5
Always tasty but only reason for no 5 stars is because they have the slowest line of any cafe rio I have every been to. Delicious food!!	4	Cafe Rio	3.5
Ordered off of GrubHub and the delivery was 30 past the later estimate for delivery which was very frustrating because it was already an hour estimate from time of order which is a very long wait. I got the chicken drunken noodle and chicken tom yum soup. They are both pretty good, the noodles were just fairly oily, too much grease and both were a tad too salty too, which is always my fear in ordering any Asian dishes, especially Thai food. Not sure I would order from them again, but I did ask for a discount because the delivery was so late so I got 20% off the order.	3	The Memory Thai	3
Poppa Naps BBQ catered at a personal home for two nights in a row for a company party, and he did a great job! BBQ food was great on the first night, and the second night we had fabulous prime ribs, asparagus, and veggies. He's a nice guy and I recommend having him cater your party!	5	Poppa Naps BBQ	5
So... I just wrote a very long review and it got deleted somehow.  First off, service was great all around,  especially for me sitting at the very end of the bar.  Calamari (somewhere around $20) was wayyyyy overcooked.  Clear soup for $6 was maybe 5oz, and it sucked.  Yellowtail Serrano was $22, and I think it was better than anything but still too expensive.  Food overall is extremely overpriced for quality and quantity. Pricing may be extra high because the convention center is attached and it's on the Strip, but it's still absurd.  I almost wrote a review after my first time here but decided to give it another shot. Very disappointing.	2	Kumi Japanese Restaurant + Bar	3.5
Great bar with some pretty good food. Their breakfast sandwiches are delicious though super unhealthy :-) the only thing I wish they had were pool tables!	4	The Bar @ Las Vegas Blvd & Wigwam	4

I came here sometime last week and was pretty disappointed. The server Matt was very short and came off a bit rude at times like he didn't want to be there. I am mostly annoyed because I had left him a 5 dollar tip on a 10 dollar tab which seems more than fair.. then i check my bank statement and the posted payment was 17 dollars so It seems Matt was a but unhappy with his tip and decided to add some extra money to it. i'm guessing he probably does this often as most people would not notice this.. I will not be returning if this is how customers are treated	1	Romano's Macaroni Grill	3
Of all the Todai's I've been too... I love the Las Vegas Todai the most. They have more selections and really friendly service. For some reason I didnt get sick off of this Todai.. hahahaha and the arcadia  one usually I get purty sick.. eWwww.. haahhaha	5	Todai Restaurant	3.5

"Yes! Go here! Did not expect to find something so amazing on the outskirts of Vegas. This place was quaint yet modern. The food had a twist or was kicked up a notch. Had the grilled cheese with apple chutney spread and fresh apple slices. So tasty with a little side salad. Also tried the Benicio. Sooooo good! Eggs Benedict with a new bend. After we ordered this dish, they let us know it is award winning. Would have to agree. 

If you make it to this place you'll be so happy for the rest of the day. Great service too. Robin is a hoot!"	5	Lulu's Bread & Breakfast	4
We eat here each week and love it. The service is excellent and the food is as good as it gets for Las Vegas. They also give you a complementary desert. Nice place and nice people.	4	Hong Kong Garden Seafood & Dim Sum Cafe	3.5
Management here is a joke. Straight up lied to me when I called asking where my order was. When pizza finally showed up it was room temperature - cheese all congealed and wings cold. Please go somewhere else. In general I love Papa John's but this location sucks.	1	Papa John's Pizza	2
"Longest wait ever, but so worth it!! After reading the reviews I had to come here and see how great this place is. 

Our service was excellent. Even though the place was full capacity, our drinks were always full, and plenty of times someone came by to make sure everything was good. 

We ordered biscuits and gravy, a side of ham, an omelet, and French toast. Everything was delicious!"	4	Mr Mamas	4.5
The Palm is located in The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. My boyfriend and I went here on a weekday for dinner after making reservations on OpenTable and were seated right away in a cozy booth. Our food was great! The bread was amazing (all four different kinds). My boyfriend ordered the New York steak, and I got the filet mignon with a 6 oz. lobster tail on the side. Both were really delicious! Our waiter was prompt and polite, and he answered all our questions about the different steaks we could get. I had a really good time here.	5	The Palm Las Vegas	4
Quick, decent chinese food. Love the Walnut shrimp and Crab rangoon!	4	Lotus Garden Cuisine	3.5
Super food!!! Had a great meal here last weekend- literally everything we ordered was awesome. Highly recommend the lamb tacos. Shout out to the manager who helped us with our "ItsOnMe" issue - great guy- Thanks!	5	Carson Kitchen	4.5
Really fast delivery - Food was piping hot - some strange things though... The chicken in the chicken chow mein was fried???? - WTF????? It wasn't terrible, but definitely not what I wanted. The walnut shrimp is GROSS - I order this everywhere and this one had a really sickly tangy sauce on it - YUCK . General chicken - their batter is kinda "fluffy" so there is a lot of fried dough before you get down to the little niblet of chicken. Ahi tuna nachos - NOT little chunks of diced fresh tuna but more like a tuna mashed up paste on the wontons. Fried rice was good - just reaaaaaly greasy - but still good flavor. Crab rangoon - fine. Wor wonton soup - fine.	3	China AAA	4
We order from this place all of the time. I've had their Seafood Combo Tom Yum, the Sliced Beef Soup, the Beef Combo Soup, Fried Chicken Over Fried Rice, and now their Duck Soup. Everything is great.	5	Thai Style Noodle House	4
"I ordered from this place without issue in the past, but this last time has guaranteed I will never be coming back and you can thank your employee Cynthia for that. I ordered roughly $50 worth of food and gave a decent tip in advance.

First problem, after waiting until my lunch ended I called to cancel the order and was told the order already left so I could not cancel the order.
 
Second problem, the food came an hour after their delivery time stated. 

Third problem, the food came missing the coconut flan and the spinach and cream cheese soup.

At this point I was fed up and told the driver I will not accept this order, it's late and missing items. I want to cancel it and have my money refunded. The driver David stated because of the delay and missing items I could get my refund, but he'd leave the food anyway. I told him I did not want the food so he decided to leave it with security and I went back to work leaving the food with security.

Fourth problem, your employee Cynthia has the audacity to say that there was only one missing item and that they'll refund the soup, but the flan is in the order and I'll have to pay for the rest. So per Cynthia I am to pay full price for an order that was an hour late and also pay for one item I never even got.

I informed the Eat 24 rep that the entire building is wired for audio and video and that security was willing to sign a statement on my behalf. I had to threatened to claim the charge as fraud and file a complaint with the BBB to get refunded. This isn't good customer service and Cynthia should be fired."	1	Patisserie Manon	4
Crunch donuts are the best. Katy Cherry is the bomb.com. I just wished Ubereats listed all of their donuts in the list for the dozen donuts. There's a few I haven't tried yet because of that.	5	Crunch Donut Factory	3.5
Great food, super fast delivery, you can preorder though eat24, and the Sweet Corn Fritters are to die for. Order them, you'll thank me.	5	Tacos El Jefe's	4
I'm not a fan of chocolate at all, but this place is so good & delicious! We missed our reservation but like 30 mins & the staff were so nice & we got seated almost right away anyways. We had 6 people in our group & we all ordered at 2 things each & everything was exceptionally good. Defiantly will be going back.	4	Max Brenner	4
Not only is this one of the cutest shops ever, but they make the best desserts ever at a very reasonable price. It was packed when I was there, but the line went really quick even though everyone was really confused where the line was. I will defiantly be visiting here again!	5	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
Decent food, poor customer service. I used to order a vegetarian sandwich and a mango smoothie here weekly on my lunch break. Last time I went, though, I was shocked to find multiple small pieces of plastic blended throughout my smoothie. I was initially not upset, assuming that Lee's would make it right. Unfortunately I was wrong. I was treated poorly after returning with the pieces of plastic, to the point where the management was acting suspicious and basically accusing me of trying to scam them out of a smoothie. I was then told to write my name and number on a piece of paper and leave it with them so that a higher up could contact me when possible. 2 days later I received the phone call, ready for an apology and a refund at the very least. All they were willing to do was replace the smoothie. On top of all that, when I showed up for it, I had to argue with the manager just to get the same large size I had originally paid for. Safe to say my coworkers and I will not be going to Lee's anymore. Luckily there are many similar restaurants in the area. I'll post a picture of my plastic mango smoothie!	1	Lee's Sandwiches	3
"This place has the BEST mixed veggies in town. The pad Thai and many other dishes are to die for. If you want it spicy just let them know and they'll kick it up even more than normal. 
The atmosphere is awesome, relaxing and quiet. The staff is extremely sweet and attentive, it's perfect in between classes!"	5	Chao Thai Restaurant	4
Ate there today. Not only was the food good but they had Shiner Bock on tap and the manager, as I perceived him, was great. Definitely will return	5	Streets of New York	3.5
"AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. This is by far my new favorite place to eat in town. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The atmosphere created a place where you can meet new people who share similar ideas on diet and generally, lifestyles. I have had the pizzas, dumplings, pastas and jack fruit tacos, all were to die for. Give this place a try if you're vegan, vegetarian, or just trying to score a delicious and healthy meal. 
I would definitely say this is a great place to start if you want to get into vegan ism or vegetarian lifestyles."	5	VegeNation	4.5
Pizza was pretty great, the staff was friendly and made suggestions when I came in to pick up my order and talked like I had been there 100 times. Nice place.	5	Grinders Pizza Lounge	4
"I just want to give this place a shout out for understanding the Vegan life! When I called to order my pad Thai with tofu, they asked if I was okay with egg. I was happy to see they were cautious of people's potential diet choices. Especially to those people who are new, such as myself and may not know that this dish contained egg. 
They also helped me pick an app over the phone that was vegan friendly. When I came in and asked what soup they had available the lady (who didn't take my order) asked if I was vegan and offered Tom kah or something of that nature. Which of course correlated with the diet. 
I ordered my pad Thai extra spicy and the soup spicy, they were both phenomenal. I also had an order or crispy veggie rolls, which were delicious with the plum sauce. Thanks for the great food! I'll be back soon!"	5	Table Thai Bar & Bistro	4.5
It seems like everyone's first day in this place. It's taking half an hour to get a single smoothie out then they are getting sent back. It also seems like they forgot about 4 orders while I was there. Don't go here	1	Tropical Smoothie Cafe	2
"This place is a like a movie that all of your friends rave about for weeks and build it up to be something spectacular, but when you finally see it, it's just okay. I heard big talk about how great the terrible service was. I went with a group of 10 ladies who were all expecting to be treated like crap. 

The waiter was a little short with us, but not too rude. They did make dunce caps for a bunch of us with some really raunchy quotes on them that were funny. 

The food was typical bar food-chicken strips, buffalo chicken sandwiches, burgers, etc. It all tasted decent-good food to eat before a big night of drinking!

Some other tables looked to be treated a little crappier than us, but I don't think I'll make an effort to head back there next time when I'm in Vegas."	3	Dick's Last Resort	3
My experience as a consumer with hussongs was awsome to say the least . my first impression was great costomer sevice , the bartender there "amanda" hands down is the reason i frequent this establishment consistently.. The food is great and served promptly.. Yes , im a fan of hussongs!!	5	Hussong's Cantina Boca Park	3.5

My goto place for Thai food for pick up. Only drawback is the limited option for vegetarians.	4	Lucki Thai	4.5
The food was pretty good. I ordered snow crabs legs and my husband ordered shrimp. I think they were both over cooked, but decent. The seasoning saved it. The service is slow and lagging. We both had sodas that didn't get refilled once till we were done and our mouths were on fire. They seem well staffed, but just kinda all over the place. Very nice staff though.	3	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
"While staying at the Cosmopolitan my boyfriend and I decided to try Eggslut on our last day for breakfast. Unfortunately, we fell for all the advertisements around the hotel marketing Eggslut and didn't bother to check the reviews before eating there.

Quality: 

We both ordered the Slut which was an egg on top of potato puree served in a glass with salt garnished with chives. I didn't expect the egg to be so runny, but what I didn't like was the watery potato puree I was expecting it to be a little bit thicker. 

I also ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich with chimichurri sauce with I thought was quite better in flavor than the Slut. I did like the chimichurri sauce and tri-tip but felt that there was something missing from the sandwich.

To finish it off we got a chocolate chip cookie but it was too heavy on the sea salt that we couldn't eat it. 

I would recommend the tri-tip over Slut. 

Service:

Although there was a long line I expected our order to come out a bit faster. We waited about 30 minutes for our food to come out. I saw other guest who were behind us in line receive their order before ours even parties that were more then two people.

Overall:

Disappointed in all the hype and attention Eggslut has and will not being going there again the next time I'm in Vegas."	3	Eggslut	4
This place was great! We started off with the truffle fries, which were fantastic. Finally, a restaurant that does truffle fries right! my husband ordered the spicy miso burger and I ordered the miyagi San burger. Both were very tasty. We definitely enjoyed it.	4	Bachi Burger	3.5
"Sitting outside waiting for my husband to order, all the tables are dirty and an employee is sitting at a table with feet up and says to me ""you can go inside and tell someone to clean it"". Are you that lazy? I have to do your job for you? I hope at least the food is as good as other cafe rio's but so far, this location is pretty dirty, and bad service. Also, the inside seating is very small and very crowded and it's way past the lunch rush.  

After eating the sweet pork salad, which I've had enough times to know how good it is, I can say it was pretty bland at this location. They gave very little meat and were very stingy with the rice and beans. This location needs a new staff."	2	Cafe Rio	3.5
I wanted to like this place, I really did. We ordered one of the combo things for $35 and it was a lot of food! I was stoked to try it but when I found a pubic hair in our Mac and cheese I just couldn't. I didn't have the heart to say anything but it really ruined it. So gross.	1	Rollin Smoke Barbeque	4.5
The best Mongolian in town! For years we have been missing having a good Mongolian restaurant in Vegas and FINALLY we got this place! It's very good and a great value. Lots of veggies, etc to choose from. Good quality. Two thumbs up!	5	Stir Krazy Mongolian Grill	4.5
I don't even know where to start. First, my husband and I went there for the first time tonight for our date. We figured out quickly what we wanted to order. We got 1 vegetable samosa appetizer, 1 lamb and rice entree, 1 chicken tikka masala, 1 garlic naan, and 1 cola cola. It took an hour to come out, and people were getting their food way before us that came in after us. A very nice man came to our table to apologize for the wait and assured us he would take 15-20% off our bill for waiting. We thought this was very kind and didn't expect it at all. We didn't complain once for waiting, so really it was very surprising to us. Anyway, or food finally comes out and it was killer good. We enjoyed it very much, but when it came you refills on my husband water, the servic lacked. We had to wait a good amount of time for our bill but when it did come we explained we had bought their yelp $15 for $25 deal. The same kind man that said he'd discount or bill 15-20% was confused by their yelp deal and said he'd have to speak to the manager. Some time later he comes back and looks at it again and says he'll just take the $25 off. But then we no longer were compensated the 15-20% for waiting. Okay, fine we understand. Our bill AFTER being discounted the $25 was still $63!! So look at the receipt and see that we have been charged for a lot of things we did not order. We were charged for 2 vegetable samosa's, 1 kingfish entree, 1 tikka masala, 1 glass of merlot, 1 lamb entree (i can't recall the name), 1 other entree (i can't recall the name), 1 coke, 2 garlic naans, and another appetizer I can't remember the same of. I bright the receipt to our server and said hold on, you way over charged us. She knew immediately what we really ordered and ate and really changed our ticket which ended up being $24 after taking the $25 off!! But the extra shady part is is that she was helping the kind man with ringing out our ticket that they way over charged us for! I definitely think they thought they were going to get away with overcharging us. It is so disappointing because the food really was wonderful. We still tipped $8 even though the service wasn't that great and they tried to scam us, but that's the right thing to do. We will find somewhere else to eat Indian food rather than going back here.	1	Origin India Las Vegas	3.5
"The sushi is great quality. The fish is wonderful but the sushi rice is the best I have tasted. The surf and turf is wonderful with the surf being the star. The duck duck goose is also great but who doesn't love duck confit?

The fiery chocolate tart should only be ordered if you truly love chocolate....and\/or fire."	5	Morimoto	4.5

I drive all the way from Sunrise Mountain to get my Mexican mocha fix. The staff is super friendly. I'd give it a five but I think the $5 for a large is a little pricey. I'll still keep coming until they open up on the East side!	4	Sunrise Coffee	4.5
Finally an Italian restaurant with REAL Italian cuisine that isn't overly priced for the quality of food you receive! Not to mention their incredible wine list with a wine for any and every palette! I have dined here on multiple occasions now and can honestly say it's one of my favorite places to go. Whether sitting at the bar and enjoying a divine signature cocktail with the fun upbeat bartenders, or sitting at a table and receiving a one of a kind dining experience....you're guaranteed to leave happy and satisfied!	5	Salute Trattoria Italiana	3.5
A friend and I visited Rise and Shine a few days ago for the first time. We arrived 30 minutes before they closed and asked the host if they were still seating and apologized for our late arrival. The kind gentleman assured us that it wasn't an issue and got us seated right away. The waitress was also extremely polite and very helpful. But most of all, the food was fantastic! An all around great experience.	4	Rise & Shine a Steak & Egg Place	4
"Seating at Japanese Ramen joints are very similar. 3 -  6 tables and a bar, and a waiting list that you write your name on and wait to be called. At good Ramen places, a half hour to 45 minute wait is the norm. They aren't places to linger. They are places to eat and leave.

Early on a Saturday night, before the huge CES tradeshow, we hoped it would not have a line curling around the block as it did the year before during the trade show. With a little bit of parking ""karma"" we snagged a parking spot as someone else left, signed in and waited.

We were fortunate. After 20 minutes, we were in. Some Ramen places do a complete ""meal"" with broth, meat, egg, veggies, etc. for about $15 Monta does the ""basic"" with add-ons that comes up to the same price. But that meant you could get what you extras you wanted. More meat, maybe another egg or an extra helping of corn or nori.

I had the Tonkatsu Shoyo broth (pork bones and soy sauce) with extra charsui (fatty pork), stewed egg and nori. Seated at the bar meant we got a ring side view of the cooks: The huge pots of broth at a roiling boil, how they heated the bowls before using them, the finishing of the bowls.

Once they arrived, we slurped it down - like you are supposed to, before the Ramen sat in the broth too long and the texture changed. Excellent noodles, tasty - very tasty broth, fatty slices of pork and stewed egg with the yolk just a little ""custardy"" - very yum.

Definitely worth the usual wait - if we were to head back there again."	5	Monta Ramen	4
"As usual, in a place I haven't been before, I used Yelp to see what was available in Las Vegas Town Square (which is another review in itself) and read off the likely choices to my traveling companion, my brother. 

""What about British food?""
""I live in London remember? English gourmet cooking is an oxymoron.""
""Oh come on, let me look at the menu. If they have pies and chips should be okay.""
""Greasy fish and soggy chips!""
""How about real Shepard's Pie? With lamb, not beef?""
""Eh.""
""Toad in the hole?""
""They have Toad in the hole??""
Sold.

I had Steak and ale pie with mash, and he dithered before settling on Toad in the hole, and had his eye on sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Then the plates came out. HUGE dinner plates. 

""Looks authentic,""

He tasted the mash. I tasted the mash. We both declared it good. He cut into the sausage Yorkshire pud and put it in his mouth. I swear his eyes rolled back as he chewed. We exchanged bits of our dishes. We exclaimed over the taste and texture. We had too much to eat and couldn't order dessert.

Then we waddled out to complete our errand and headed back to the strip to finish up set-up for the CES.

Authentic British food, 'Murican portions and as good as it gets."	5	English's Quintessentially British	3
"Good solid authentic and tasty dishes at reasonable prices. Noodle Exchange in the Gold Coast Casino is our ""go to"" place when we are staying at the Casino. It's the place to get a bowl of porridge after a long flight, you are feeling a little queasy and want your comfort food.

It's not your ""fancy"" restaurant but more like your local corner restaurant where the service can be hit or miss but the food has never disappointed. Come here for your bowl of noodles, congee, BBQ and rice dish. 

The hotpot meals in the evening is a recent addition (I also understand it went away but then came back again) - and it is a good value with a broth base (too many hotpot places give you hot water instead of a broth). For anyone who has never had a Chinese hotpot - you put in the vegetables to cook and give the broth flavor, then add your meats, taking them out and dipping them in sauces to eat them, then after all the food is gone, you drink the wonderfully flavorful soup.

Noodle Exchange has the usual beef \/ chicken \/ seafood hotpots and the bases are regular, spicy and herbal. If you have several people eating the hotpot, you can ask for two broths - they bring out a divided bowl. But do give the herbal broth a try. Let it boil a few minutes for the herbs and spices to release their fragrance before you start cooking your meats.

I will have to make special mention of the sauces. The Hoisin sauce for the Peking duck, the Sate sauce for hotpots - they are exceptionally good.

Once again, a good solid choice for authentic Chinese food. Not fancy, just good.

P.S. If service was top notch, they'd get a five star from me."	4	Noodle Exchange	3.5
"Talk about a hole in the wall foodie's secret! Neither the bellhop at the hotel nor the taxi driver had  heard of this place and we had to pull out our smart phones to map the way there. Located in a semi-industrial area that's just 10 minutes away from the strip, it took a bit of convoluted driving to actually get there. It's not a fancy place, simple benches, plastic utensils, noisy, with an order counter and serve your own drinks, but oh man... the food... the food! (They also have sweetened tea - have to have that in a Southern BBQ place, right? Right??)

This place was suggested by a couple of local friends when I was visiting and we met up for dinner. We got what I think was the ""Pit special"" which was the variety platter, 5 meats and 3 sides - Pulled pork,1\/4  chicken, hot links, ribs and brisket - an extra order of the corn nuggets - think of tater tots made with kernels of corn and corn meal, green beans and coleslaw. The slaw was good but we had to dole out the corn nuggets to be fair or any one of us would have hogged them all.

Best Southern BBQ I've had in a long, long while - so good I did not try any of the other sauces - they make several - on the meat. They did not drown everything in sauce either, but encouraged you to try the various sauces. Crisp, well seasoned chicken skin, saucy (but not too saucy) pulled pork, ribs with just the right amount of char, tender brisket, spicy links... it was all good.

Then it was time for dessert and the chef was walking around talking to customers and we asked about dessert, with a friend asking if ""Mama's Banana Puddin"" was made of real custard. Hoo boy, you'd think we just insulted his Momma. ""You think I would use box vanilla pudding? Man, you gotta stand there and stir that custard by hand or it ain't good! That's the only way you can make Banana puddin!""

We settled on the banana pudding and the blackberry cobbler and shared - because we were so full from dinner (and we had left overs to take home) - we scraped those bowls clean! Talk about greed... I was tempted to get another! The Banana custard was smooth and tasty, the consistency of the custard just perfect - none of that grainy fake pudding mix in that!. The cobbler topping was not overly sweetened which let the blackberry taste shine through.

Altogether, a wonderful gustatory experience - and the cost for this wonderful experience? Oh... about $12 each."	5	Rollin Smoke Barbeque	4.5
"So... I was at the Venetian Towers for the recent Consumer Electronics Show and ended up eating at Lobster ME every day (as did my colleagues) after I had my first Lobster roll there. In all, I had the lobster roll (4x), the lobster melt (the French with Brie), the fries, the chips, the very yummy blueberry lemonade, the slaw (ate every bit of it) and the Lobster Bisque.

Lobster Me gets a solid four stars from me. The food was consistently good even though the place was slammed because of the show. The fries and chips were crisp, the bread nicely toasted, and the bisque surprisingly good for a place that's essentially Fast Food.

The Roll at $18 seemed a little expensive and looked small, but it was overflowing with the claw meat and it comes with chips made in the store (not ripples out of a bag) and a condiment sized bit of coleslaw - just enough. Upgrading it to a combo substituting chips for fries and a Drink ($4) is a no-brainer as the drink itself is $4.

The Melt uses tail meat but seemed a bit skimp but at $10, value isn't bad... and comes with the same chips and coleslaw. 

The Lobster Bisque was surprisingly tasty (again, for a fast food joint), and the lemonades were also tasty and not too sweet - the blueberry flavored lemonade was really quite yummy.

Service was excellent. I did not think I could ""combo"" a Melt and the register clerk informed me it was the better deal when I wanted both fries and a drink with it. They also honored the long (LONG!) expired coupon that was linked to their Yelp profile when I ""checked in."" Given the crowd and the noise, it was no surprise that they got an order or two mixed up, but they were cheerfully corrected.

I hope it is still there in the Venetian Towers next year!"	4	Lobster ME	3.5
"Really great place with tons of options. The service is always very prompt and I love that you can get some clean items so you don't feel guilty when eating out. I had the salmon with a walnut pesto sauce that came on the side but I added it on my salmon and it was delicious! It came with two side choices and I did quinoa and grilled asparagus. Minimal to no seasoning which I like as it's better that way. 
Their juices are all so delicious too! Really good sizes and they are nice and thick that you almost feel like you are drinking a smoothie.
Whenever I come to visit the area to see family I come here at least once and I'm always happy!"	5	Greens and Proteins	4
Came to Big Wong with my family. It was the best family meal we had in Las Vegas. It's affordable, portion is decent, the flavor just took me back to my younger years in Southeast Asia. Will surely come back for their Hainan Chicken rice and their delicious lemon tea that I have to order 3 times.	5	Big Wong Restaurant	4
"It's not a secret that I'm a huge sushi snob. If it's not super fresh, I'm not happy.

This place is fantastic! The decor if fun and funky and so are their drinks. Don't get me wrong, we clearly did not go here for the drinks, but they were a definite added bonus. Try the one with the Guava it will blow your mind. Right when you enter there is a bar that you can sit and drink at or you can get seated and the tables are classy and comfortable. There's a little private party section and a massive alcohol selection. The wait staff were on top of their game and not at all pretentious.

I loved that this place is open incredibly late, getting fresh sushi at midnight on a Tuesday was not a problem. Everything we ate was really simple and tasty. The shi-take mushroom skewers were pleasantly surprising and the salmon fell apart in my mouth before I had the chance to chew.  They had a few basic rolls that were normal priced, but overall it was a little pricey. However, it's expected in Vegas and worth every penny."	4	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4

Love the food here if you can get it. Waited 15 minutes for a table - to be expected on a Sunday morning. Waited around an hour to get food- never came. Asked waiter to check on order. 5 minutes later still hadn't heard anything. Should have been offered a beer or something. Just sat and stared at my empty table with no explanation. Even though I like the food, probably won't return. Too many other options.	1	MTO Café	4.5

This review is for the LATE NIGHT eater. We headed here specifically because it advertised a late night menu - which is limited for those seeking good food after a late night out in Vegas. THIS is not the place to go. I can't say if the food quality is better during the day - I hope so, since I've seen this location brimming with patrons during regular hours. However, I can say that the quality of food was below any food expectations anyone can have when we visited. Everything from the apps, pizza and Caesar salad felt like it was either reheated from a pre prepared version in the kitchen or put together with the lowest of standards. I can only hope that the lack of taste and presentation is due to the restaurant's assumption that patrons at 4 am are either too drunk or too desperate to care about good food. The only reason I even give this a 1 star is because our waiter was nice, helpful and accommodating to our needs. He - not the food - get the star.	1	Sugar Factory American Brasserie	3
Came in 6\/5\/17 to Use a Groupon for frozen margaritas. The ladies acted like I was being a bother since I didn't order food. The margaritas were great! You must pay the tax on the deal at the restaurant, but that was about $4. Customer service was lacking so that's why I gave 3 stars.	3	Tacos N' Ritas	3
I came here 6\/5\/17, and I ordered the fried Lobsicle. It was a lightly breaded lobster tail on a stick. It was so good, not greasy whatsoever. I waited until I got back to my hotel room about 20 minutes later to eat it, and it still had a refreshing taste to it. I will definitely come back here on future trips to try other menu items.	4	Lobster ME	3.5
"It was just ok.....nothing special.

To start off....we ordered the 2 types of meat: BBQ pork and Roast pork and it was quite a small portion for the price ($13... not worth it).   Since it was so small, we decided to order half a BBQ duck afterwards.   Taste was ok...

All the other dishes were ordinary.  Prices seem high.

Service was lacking....we had someone who could not use a chopstick and she had to get up and get a fork herself.  Place is not that big yet we had trouble flagging a waiter down.

After the meal, we asked the waiter to call a taxi for us and he refused and just gave us the phone number instead.

Would I return?  Nope."	2	Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant	2
"I had supper here.   We had reservations and were seated immediately upon arrival.  Service was excellent. 

Bread basket was pretty like a flower arrangement.  Sampling the different types of bread was interesting.

We all started off with some stone crabs....not bad but expensive...the dipping sauce was very good.  We all ordered the ribeye steak (one of us ordered the ribeye with bone in).    Steaks were cooked perfect (from rare to medium).  

We were stuffed but we ordered a desert anyways....don't remember the name but it was like a mousse pie with peanut butter (very rich and good).

This is a very good steakhouse.  If you go here, you really need to order their steaks (some of their other offerings didn't look great).  Remember you don't make friends with salad."	4	Joes Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab	4.5
"Dropped in the first week of January 2009 for some lunch after getting off the plane.   I had a craving for pull pork and this place was the closest to the airport.

I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was excellent.  Make sure you drown the sandwich is BBQ sauce.  If you eat this sandwich making a mess, then you have done it right.  I have to go back and try their ribs.

Very decent BBQ....I would recommend you yelpers give it a try."	4	Memphis Championship Barbecue	3
"Ok....I make it a habit to eat buffet once everytime I am in town.  This is one of the best buffets in Vegas (along with the one at Wynn for $38).

I would give Bellagio the slight edge over Wynn because their desert station is far superior (although I am not into sweets).

King Crabs Legs, Prime rib, rack of lamb.....that is all I need to be happy.  However, I can only do one buffet when I am in town.  Take your pick: Bellagio or Wynn....you can't go wrong with either one."	4	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
"Top rating goes to this restaurant for the food and service.  You must make a stop at this place when you are in town.  Serving mainly seafood and steaks....you will enjoy the sauces that go into every dish.

It is pricey but everything in Vegas is expensive.  You are in Sin city to spend and enjoy."	5	Mesa Grill	4
"Needed a break from shopping at the Factory Outlet....this seem like a good choice after reading some of the reviews here.   Price was very reasonable (something like $16-17 per person).

The sushi was just ok....maybe I'm a sushi snob now.  I was not impressed with their sushi.   The grill and stir fry section was decent but I went there was sushi.  A fairly large selection of sushi and food but I have had much better at other sushi buffets.

Service was sub-par.  Dishes were piled high before someone came to clear them.  Water was not refilled promptly.  Asked for coffee and it took a very long time for it to arrive.

I would not return....I'd rather pay a little more and go somewhere else."	2	Makino	3.5
"This place is old school.....and I like it.  I was staying on the strip and dropped in for supper at their BBQ restaurant.   This was one of the best deals I had in Vegas.   I had a 2 for 1 coupon for the BBQ.  The requirement to use the coupon was to join their players club (which I did) and they gave me a food credit of $5.

Placed two orders for the 1\/2 chicken and 1\/2 rack of ribs combo ($8.99).   Their 1\/2 rack is a full rack back home.  The serving was huge and I must admit that the food was very good.  Quality was surprising very decent.  After using the coupon and applying my food credit, I ended up paying around 6 bucks for two meals....what a deal.

Of course, I proceeded to lose $100 at their blackjack table after this hearty meal....Damn you, Vegas!!!!

The dealers were very friendly and it felt like I was in Old Vegas.  I love it when I can have a conversation with the dealers while we play (I'd ask stupid questions like what is the biggest loser\/winner you dealt with, weird situations while working, etc.).   

It was very slow the Monday night I was there (so no karaoke was happening).   I hope this place makes it through this tough time.  The casino is small (compared to the mega casinos located nearby) but I would definitely return.  I need to try their un-advertised $6.99 steak special next time.  Ellis Island Rules."	4	Ellis Island Hotel, Casino & Brewery	4
"I had lunch here twice and dinner once.   We were looking for something inexpensive and this place fit the bill.   I would have liked some pho but it would involve taking cab rides off the strip.

For lunch, I ordered the teriyaki chicken rice bowl special which came with a salad and miso soup for $8.99.

Dinner was good.... they had very decent maki rolls (try the playboy roll).

I would return."	4	Ichiban Sushi	3.5
"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I kind of liked this place.  The price of the buffet was very affordable.   Yes, there are limits on specific items but I have seen that at other buffet places.

The service was adequate when I was there.  Overall the food was good and I enjoyed my meal.   I would return."	3	Sushi Factory	3
"It is fairly inexpensive place to eat breakfast in Vegas.  I had breakfast and lunch at this restaurant.   Breakfast was decent and lunch was just ok.

I have to admit that I am spoiled.  Having eaten smoked meat most of my life in Montreal (Schwartz's, Smoke Meat Pete's, Lesters, Snowden Deli).....Stage Deli just doesn't compare.

It was an ok sandwich and the price was excellent.  Having lunch for around $10 in Vegas is a bargain.  I give it a 3-star because of their price and breakfast was decent.    If you ever want a real melt in your mouth smoked meat (pastrami) sandwich, visit Montreal.  It's even better than Carnagie Deli in Manhattan."	3	Stage Deli Of Las Vegas	3.5
The wife and I stopped in here for a second time this last weekend.  We really liked that they do half-rolls for their all-you-can-eat so we can get lots of different flavors without over-indulging!  I highly recommend the Volotion Motion Potion, the Helmet Crest Roll, the 702 Roll, and the Takashi Roll.  We also enjoyed the Funny Name Roll, and everyone should have the Volcano Roll too, but recognize it's a little heavy (baked).  We are definitely looking forward to going back sometime soon!  Special thanks to Whitney and the rest of the team for their great service.	5	Xtreme Sushi & Sterling Steakhouse	2
"I went to aria cafe, party of 8 on a Saturday night at 8:45pm. The restaurant was about 1\/3 full but it still took 10 minutes for someone to come and take our drink order.
We ordered cocktails and waters and the servers brought the waters out in pairs for some reason. In all, it took 30 minutes for everyone to get water. 

I would overlook the poor service if the food were good. Unfortunately, that is were aria cafe really fails. A few of us ordered the rotisserie herb chicken with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The chicken was very watery and runny. The quality of the ingredients used were substandard, which is disappointing for a restaurant at a very nice hotel.
One friend ordered the general taos chicken, which was basically fried chicken doused in a glazed ketchup sauce. 
The chicken fettuccine looked straight out of a stouffers or lean cuisine box. 
The last friend, a self described ""burger connoisseur"" concluded that the burger was one of the five worst burgers of his life. He's probably had upwards of 1000 burgers across 20 states, six countries and three continents so his opinion is credible. 
Aria cafe is a legitimate blight on a hotel like the aria."	1	ARIA Café	2.5
"Sophia's Cafe is a great place. 
Very friendly and quick service.
In my opinion the inside is a little dark and could use a little bit more light.
The food on the other hand is a out of this world and you must try this locations food at least 1 time."	5	Sofia's Cafe	3.5
Went there for "happy hour"... Wasn't too happy. Weird service\/ ordering system. Was asked to order & pay right after stepping into the joint... Had no idea what drinks they even had to choose from. After questioning the cashier, she rambled off a couple beers I have never heard of. She let me try a sample of one, which I didn't care for. Left after my boyfriend finished his beer.. I think he enjoyed it tho :)	2	Beach Hut Deli	4
Delicious! (Way better than KF.... The other chicken joint) Tender chicken with crunchy skin, excellent fries, & garlic bread! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!	5	Raising Cane's	4

Chicago themed.. So it has to be good! ;) They have a big projection screen to watch all the best games, along with a few more TVs on the wall. Decent specials for football & Blackhawks games. Pizza is good.. Wings are delicious. I wish they had cheese sauce! :( Owner & staff are all real friendly. We'll definitely be back.	5	Windy City Beefs N Pizza	4
Small little laid back place. Friendly service & atmosphere. Chicago themed.. Even better! Good pizza & good deals. Place was kinda smokey.. I could do without that.	3	La Piazza	3.5

Rockin taco rocks!! It's been delicious every time I've gone. I always get the nachos.. made fresh to order. They're HUGE so only get them if you're really hungry! They've got large frozen drinks that are awesome as well.. Oh & try a jalapeño shot if you're feeling brave!!	5	Rockin' Taco Mexican Grill	3.5

We got off to a rough start... Our cabin wasn't done on time, then we had to be switched to a different cabin bc the one we booked was damaged. We wanted to hike trails while we waited, but the ones across the street were closed & the employees weren't sure where else to go. We did find our own adventure.. Which turned out nice. The cabins were great & also ended up to be worth the wait. Very cute, clean, and comfy! Big bed, jacuzzi bath, fireplace, & patio. Wonderful scenery. I would love to go back!	5	Mt. Charleston Lodge	3.5
Yummy yummy yummy.. I left with a full tummy! Great all you can eat deal. Chef made us special things off the menu. Dessert was also good!	4	Sushi Koma	4
If I could give this place 10 stars.. I would! I've only lived in Vegas for about a month & I don't think I can count how many times I've been here! The selection of nachos is out of this world!! My favorite has to be the pulled pork.. Although I had chicken fried steak nachos for breakfast the other day, which were also phenomenal. You can't stop here without trying their white queso either! Service is always great (we like the bartender Erin & the server Loui)! They have several TVs that show games... & often have drink specials too. (Be sure to catch the $15 pitchers of daddy's margaritas during football). We will definitely be back (maybe tomorrow lol)	5	Nacho Daddy Henderson	3.5
Small portions & expensive. Waiter didn't seem to know much about the menu or drinks. My specialty drink was suppose to have candy in it... It didn't. Lasagna was tiny.. Pizza was okay. I didn't mind it.. Nothing special tho.	3	Grotto Ristorante	4
Delicioso!! Our first time trying this place! The lady that took our order was nice. Food was prepared fresh & fast! Rolled tacos were awesome & so was the chili relleno. They've got a station to add condiments too. Open 24hrs... It's the perfect 4th meal! ((All they are missing are margaritas))	5	Roberto's Taco Shop	3.5

Best places hands down to bring the kiddos !! We decided last minutes to throw my nieces 7th birthday and the placed was on packed. However I asked a employee named Cierra ask me if we were a walkin birthday and I said yes she said give me your gifts and I will set them on a table big enough for your party. Hands down the sweetest thing as I begin to tell me niece we would have to go somewhere else Cierra saved the day!!! She also grabbed some pink balloons for the table! Sissy also helped us with getting plates and forks for our cake we had brought in and had them do a birthday shout out over the intercom!!

"Las Vegas cheesecake factory was great! They sat us quickly, under ten mins. 
It was the first time I tried the mushroom burger, I usually order the Cajun pasta and let me tell you I was not disappointed it was so good and full of flavor. To drink I had the pineapple Moscow mule and oh my goodness I loved it! Definite five stars."	5	The Cheesecake Factory	4
I ordered on the Yelp app dinner for me and my boyfriend for pick up. Even though my order was a little wrong (I had ordered vegetarian pad Thai but they gave us shrimp pad Thai) they were more than happy to remake my order right away while giving us ice cold waters and letting us sit in the main area with other patrons. The ambiance is really cool and I would definitely come back and recommend to others.	5	Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert	4.5
"This place is a lot of fun, but you definitely have to have the right sense of humor.

The atmosphere is a great time and ""Taco"" (their main attraction: an entertaining fellow), will definitely get you chuckling, as he frequently pulls randoms in for lap dances (men and women alike), and sports a red thong.  The main concept is that the people working there are ""dicks"" to you, ie, they will harass and insult you, but it's all in good fun, you can dish it right back.  

I would suggest going with a group for the most fun, but its a good place for drinking with friends and grabbing some food.  The prices for food may not be the most competitive (around $15 for chicken tenders--although delish), you are mostly paying for a fun atmosphere.  

Good times, every time. 

Toodles"	4	Dick's Last Resort	3
My most favorite spot for a late night bite! They have a happy hour menu after 11pm! Everyone is always helpful and happy even when it's busy! I highly recommend sitting at the bar! This place has a special place in my heart and tummy! Food is always served fresh and quickly! Let the chefs know what you like and they'll whip something up for you! It's close to the strip but it's definitely a locals "spot"!	5	Musashi Japanese Steakhouse	4

2nd time here. I have only ordered pho here. This time I ordered the chicken, shiitake mushroom, and bok choy. (No noodles). I felt so compelled to write this review because the broth was intensely delicious. So much flavor along with the mushrooms was absolutely exquisite! There was nothing else to add to it to "enhance" the flavor.  They have a great recipe and I absolutely recommend this place. It is quite far out of the city but worth it. I don't even order a drink because it's that good.	4	WTPho	4
I have ordered from Lucki Thai a few times and they deliver not only quickly but correctly too. My all time favorite dish is their pad see ew without question. They have a perfect proportion of Thai Tea too. Some places make it too sweet or too much milk or not enough milk lol. They get it right every time. Their minimum $$ amount to order is well below other places around the area. So if you are ordering for yourself you don't have to spend 50$ to get food to your door. I haven't been to the actual restaurant yet. Regardless, they have amazing Thai, crispy egg-rolls,and shrimp tempura that is not oozing with oil!	4	Lucki Thai	4.5
Overall it was good. Before going inside there was a line out the door, however seating was immediate. They brought over water and took the order. Spring rolls came first which were delicious. Then the calamari (which I did send back because of the amount of grease pouring out of it). Then the vegan phó was served. It was delicious. I've been here before and it's always a hit with me! Absolutely fresh and flavorful. Not too salty! Great amount of veggies, and plenty of smiling faces. Good place for large families although expect a longer than usual wait time for a table! They are always busy	3	Pho Kim Long	3.5
I came here once and i had really high hopes for this place. The flavors werent all there and ive had better at the thai place by my house. Super overpriced for what youre getting. The seats are uncomfortable and to speak to anyone else at the table I literally had to lean across the table. It was nice to look at but I wouldnt spend my money there again.	3	Lemongrass	3.5
"How do you NEGATIVE rate this place?  ""Monta Japanese Noodle House was shut down by the Southern Nevada Health District after a routine inspection found 47 demerits on March 12.

Violations included spoiled food, potentially hazardous food stored at improper temperatures and staff not properly washing their hands. Also among the citations, an inadequate number of hand washing sinks and ineffective pest control measures."" 

I went here once.. And some days later they shut the place down.. HECKA gross!"	1	Monta Ramen	4
You know. EVERY TIME I order take out I ask for ginger. I'm trying to open the bag to DOUBLE check they put ginger in my order. EVERY TIME!!! They forget! I'm not even kidding! I'm sick! Of having to ask. This time they didn't even let me open the bag cause they were SURE!! I had ginger. Get home. NO GINGER! Why!!? Do I have to open the bag and PROVE to every worker there that I am ASKING for ginger and get none every time. I called and informed them of the mishap for the 80th time it happened (yes the amount is an exaggeration but you get it) then was told to come back.. Like nah. I'm not driving back!!!! I'm taking one star away for this reason alone. So frustrating. So I apologize this "rant" because you may think it's just about ginger but it's not. It's about the **doubt**I go through whenever I order. The disappointment from the reassurance I receive when I SPECIFICALLY ask to check. Ridiculous.	3	Sushi Mon	4

"Updating"" as a reply for the owner. 

Firstly: I never said nor stated I am strictly vegan. NOT being vegan however, doesn't diminish nor make my inquiries any less valid. My personal dietary restrictions don't take away my concerns for what is in your food that I am PAYING for and putting in my body. I'm flattered you dug through my other reviews though. 

Secondly: How are you going to dispute ME on what YOUR employee SAID TO ME - To go and visit the taco shop around there. Because yes, he also is NOT vegan (like I told him I wasn't!)and eats at the taco shop when he doesn't want to eat where he works. Obviously you weren't there because if you were I would have received all this information on the spot. Which leads us to

My third point: I appreciate you giving us information about the food (now). The problem you STILL FAIL to realize AND address, is that NOWHERE on your website, or menus can we have the knowledge of (and verify) ingredients and the sources. You said it yourself!! All those other places are frozen , pre-made etc. So we're suppose to just now take your word on the basis that you ""exposed"" other establishments? That's what I meant when I said you have a responsibility as a VEGAN establishment to provide this information TRANSPARENTLY and have it READILY available to support your claim. It's nowhere to be found. If you don't understand what I am asking for with ""What are your ingredients for your all your vegan protein?"" I cant help you. That is as clear as I can make it. This IS about Panchos, not any other place. 

Fourth: To be fair here. I read a couple of reviews BEFORE writing mine because I said to myself  ""Am I? Am I the only one who thinks this way?"" And no! I am not alone. Read some four star reviews, even five star reviews and you'll see where I get what I am saying in my review. Your customer base (not all) says your establishment is out of items constantly, the drink selection is minuscule to bare minimum and I got the ""hole in the wall"" reference from another two reviews. I was not the first one. So maybe even if reviews give you four or five stars, you should read them. Or don't. It's your business. 

Lastly: This is very audacious of you.

 ""Simply for the fact that we are 100% vegan, non-gmo and low sodium... your life just got healthier.""

Why cause  low sodium? Just because you believe that less sodium is good for you shows me how uninformed you personally really are. The scientific community has never come to consensus  that less sodium is best for everyone. Low sodium IS better when you've overloaded your system with it or if you have an intolerance to it. I am not in need of low sodium or non-gmo. I am in need of less calories. Which is what most of your dishes are NOT. Based on what I was served (NOT HOW MUCH I ATE) alone, it contained all my calories for one 24 hour period... a detriment to MY diet. Why would you think eating out at your establishment is making MY life healthier? How do you know I'm not having a cheat meal at your restaurant? Healthy = is a dish with protein equivalent to fats and carbs OR high volume (A LOT OF FOOD) but low fat\/low carb. Again, something the dishes served here aren't. 

'When people say that Pancho's Vegan Tacos is a ""fast food"" place.. makes me wonder.' 

Wonder no more. I just answered it for you.  If I ate here everyday I would become morbidly obese. It doesnt fit the healthy profile based on the proportions of carbs\/protein or volume\/carbs to MAINTAIN a healthy lifestyle. Personally, I maintain a strict diet so that I can eat out often. Unfortunately, I cant do that here.

I will check out your new location once it opens and the old one closes, maybe you'll have the nutrition facts and I will surely update my review then."	2	Pancho's Vegan Tacos	4.5

My first time here and it was absolutely amazing!! Surprisingly superb beer selection. Our server was very helpful, made great suggestions and was genuinely kind.. Great place!!!	5	Mint Indian Bistro	4
My cheat meal for last week was here! I had the Cole Turkey!!! Which was absolutely phenomenal! I also had a bite of their cheesesteak! And their cheddar and ham hoagie! The cole turkey is still my favorite to this day! It's cole slaw with turkey with a dressing that is basically crack! Good crack!  the cheesesteak was delicious too! It was warm and cheesy and moderate spicy (you could still speak think and enjoy your food spicy). Their prices for their sandwiches and rolls and whatever you want to call them is absolutely reasonable for the great tasting food and quality you get! I will always be a customer for this business! And I do have to add that their consistency between shops is AMAZING! Thank you for making your food fresh and keeping food the same in all your outlets.	5	Capriotti's Sandwich Shop	4
I've been to this location once, the location on the west side of town, and the one they closed down the street from this one. I'm not sure what happened, their service used to be top notch at the closed location. The placing of the tables in this new location are awkwardly away from everyone, so much so you seem so far from everything (especially your server). The atmosphere is red dim light and art all over but you can't really appreciate it since it's too dark to be able to tell what things are, or the color of food on your plate. I always get the sangria pitcher, which is my favorite. Red or white, both good. Dates wrapped in bacon with blue cheese is still a favorite of mine. The salmon toast aren't that good in my opinion. The rest of the menu of good too. Depends on what you like more, sweet or salty. I haven't been back here and probably won't be for a while. However, I'm hoping my next visit reminds me why I used to go here so often.	3	Firefly	4.5
I've truly only had one item here. That is their shrimp fried rice! Absolutely spectacular! My MOST favorite fried rice of all time!! Inexpensive and quick and flavorful and soooo fricking good! If I could have it more often I would! :D	5	China Wan Wan	3.5

My family and I arrived here on Thanksgiving morning. I was happy I was able to have a early check-in.  The hotel is beautiful, but the service sucks. Our bathroom floor wasn't clean and the floor needed to be vacuum. We left out today for a bit and our rooms were never cleaned. Called housekeeping before we left and was told it will be done. Well the day is over and our room still isn't clean. The Manager only can offer free coffee which they give that every morning from 6am-10am. Not happy with the service...  :-(	2	Downtown Grand Hotel & Casino, An Ascend Hotel Collection Member	3.5
They messed up the first pizza, no cheese on one side  (how that happens is beyond me). So we waited for a replacement which was even worse,  barely any sauce and less cheese than the first one.  They did give us both pizzas for the price of one else, but it should have been free.	1	Pizza Hut	2
"I agree with what everything Mary said about this place! 

You expect to have outstanding service here, and it was just mediocre. We ordered the chorizo appetizer and it was fine. I ordered the sea scallops and shrimp with pasta because the waitress said it was her favorite. The pasta just tasted like butter with noodles I could make myself! And the shrimp was pretty bland. Nothing memorable. Grant ordered the steak, and that was pretty good. But overall, I wouldn't come here again. Not really worth it."	3	Emeril's New Orleans Fish House	3.5
loved that ciabatta turkey avacado and bacon. very delicious. and great for a quick bite before we headed to the hockey game at the mgm. worth the 10 minute wait. though they need more chairs for people to sit at - we had to stand out in the hall to eat our sandwiches. =\/	4	Wichcraft	3
I wasn't impressed at all with Market City. I give it two stars for the manager who sat us and made sure our water glass was filled at times. Our waiter didn't even see us when we sat down (apparently another party so big was blocking our table). He didn't really pay any attention to us either, when we needed the check. And my chicken pasta was quite dry. It actually tasted like chalk. But the rest of the pasta was ok.	2	Market City Caffe	3.5
Oh, Barry...the hilton is a huge tribute to Barry Manilow, it's hilarious. great place to stay at great prices. clean rooms. the monorail station is inside the hilton, so you have quick access to it. though it is off the strip, we didn't mind. also, the bartenders there are great. very personable.	4	LVH - Las Vegas Hotel & Casino	2.5
Excellent food and service!!  In town for the RnR half marathon, and searched for a vegan place near the convention center.   This was about a 10 minute drive from there, and it was definitely worth it!  Many vegan options, and very tasty!!	5	Veggie Delight	4
Archie's does it right. They are great about acknowledging my daughter's allergies. Chicken & eggplant, pad soon sen, and pad prik king are some of my favorites. Flamingo location has a take out drive though. Super convenient.	5	Archi's Thai Kitchen	4
Ordered six tacos to go and it took 30 minutes. Got the tacos and they were cold. I took them back and the bartender was rude and argumentative. She said they would remake them and I said I didn't have any more time to wait. She asked for a receipt which she didn't give in the first place. The restaurant wasn't even busy. This was my second time here, it's unlikely that I'll go back.	1	Tacos & Beer	4
Favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas. Chicken Marsala, aranchini, and clams linguini with spicy red sauce are staples.	5	Nora's Italian Cuisine	4
My favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. The oysters are to die for, and of course I can't go without the crab curry. I eat here every time I'm in town and every time it's as good as the last.	5	Chada Street	4
Love this place to grab a beer and the best fried green beans on the planet. BLTs are homespun and good. Cheese curds!! Typical bar food, not the healthiest but yummy. Wish it was nonsmoking.	4	Blue Ox Tavern	4.5
"Best breakfast ever.  The coffee alone is worth a visit. We had breakfast here everyday on our holiday.  The chicken apple brie crepe is my fave, but everything on the menu is good.  
The service was very good as well,"	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
I'm not sure if it was just bad timing. Multiple servers dropped their serving tray and spilled things all over when we were there. Service was also quite slow. Our margaritas were very inconsistent even when we ordered the same thing. One glass taste like juice and the other taste like it's pure tequila. The food also didn't impress me very much.	2	Nacho Daddy	4
We went during the middle of brunch and start of lunch so we got to try a bit of both. We were impressed by the food and the selection. The dessert bar was amazing; especially the gelato spinner! We also felt like we were eating with Alice in Wonderland because the decorations were so cute!	4	The Buffet	3.5
Probably one of the best meal I've had. Yes it's expensive but worth it. We tried their 6 course tasting menu and it did not disappoint. The most memorable course was the Wagyu Beef. It was so flavorful and delicious and it just melts in your mouth! The service was also excellent. The server took his time explaining each course to us.	5	Mizumi	4
This is for take out. We couldn't get reservation for time that we wanted so we ended up doing take out. The food was good and I assume it would've been better if eaten there. We got the chicken and waffle, pasta dish, and short rib. The short rib was memorable. It was soft and flavorful. The chicken and waffle was good but not amazing. The flavored watermelon (salty and spicy) was very interesting.	4	Yardbird Southern Table & Bar	4.5
The food was amazing so it was worth the almost hour long wait. The portion is also very big so sharing should be taken into consideration. They give you a mini champagne bottle for your mimosa; it's super cute! The servers were all very nice.	4	Egg & I	4.5
We stopped by here for dinner while visiting Las Vegas. It was a pleasant meal. We got noodle soupls, dan dan noodles, dumplings, chili oil wontons, and cucumber appetizers. I didn't like the cucumber dish but everything else was very flavorful and delicious! They served cucumber water as well.	4	Shang Artisan Noodle	4.5
"if you're looking for a fancy steakhouse in vegas, delmonico is your go to place. not being a huge fan of emeril lagasse's, my prenotions and opinions were turned 180 degrees after one dining experience in this magnificent establishment.

nothing here is shy of a stellar review. the food is PERFECTLY executed, the service is above and beyond, and no detail is left unfinished.

the steaks can be requested with an extra char on the outside, but the center is still a warm medium rare, perfectly juicy and exploding with flavor in every bite. the sides we ordered were also high acheivers and could be main courses in their own right. 

the desserts were phenomenal! i've had emeril's banana cream pie from another one of his restaurants at MGM before, but the warm chocolate brioche bread pudding is like your birthday, christmas, new year, all the holidays, the birth of your first child, happiest day of your life in every spoonful. it was so good, i wanted to cry.

if you are ever in vegas and want to have a flawless steak dinner, now you know where to go."	5	Delmonico Steakhouse	4
"max brenner is a great place for brunch on the vegas strip. situated conveniently in the caesars forum shops, the cute and dark little shop is home to delicious chocolates and chocolatey drink concoctions.

the banana split latte, priced at a whopping $7.50, was a thick, creamy chocolate milkshake with bananas. it was frothy and came in the most interesting yet practical cup, equipped with metal straw to keep the beverage cold until the moment it hits your lips.

the illegal chocolate chocolate chocolate pancakes were amazing. soft, pillowy, fluffy disks of dough, topped with toffee'd bananas and toasted pecans. as if that wasn't decadent enough, a generous drizzle of chocolate syrup and honey. for those chocoholics, an extra beaker of chocolate sauce sits on the side for additional dousing to your heart's content.

the skillet scramble was surprisingly delicious, coming from a chocolate shop. eggs were velvety, the sausage  was savory, the peppers and onions nicely grilled, and the spinach and mushrooms nicely seasoned. served with a crunchy and crusty roll and a side of chocolate sauce and butter. chocolate and eggs? yes, questionable. weird at first but due to the quality of the chocolate, it sort of works."	4	Max Brenner	4
"from the creators of french laundry, this wonderful restaurant sits atop the venetian hotel. we had breakfast\/brunch here and i was floored by the exceptional attention to detail. the food was absolutely mouth watering and beautifully presented.

i had a fruit and granola bowl with a side of yogurt. the fruit was perfectly ripe and sweet, the yogurt cool and thick. the granola came in a pretty little bouchon package...it was filled with more than enough for the fruit bowl...that's why they put it in a package for you to take the uneaten portion home!

don't think i just ate that for breakfast...we are of course talking about a glutton here. then i had lox on baguette. possibly the best baguette i've ever had in my whole life. the crust was thin and crisp\/crunchy, the center of the loaf was soft as clouds yet had a chewy bounce! the lox was delicious and the fixin's were top notch.

creamy and thick hot chocolate with a side of freshly squeezed orange juice, and i was ready for a full day of vegas adventures (equipped with leftover granola to snack on!)"	5	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
"being that todd english is one of the original iron chefs america, i had high expectations. too bad i was sorely let down. the appetizers were fine, but for my entree i had a terrible lamb shank. the meat was very gamey and i couldn't help but feel that i was chewing on a wet stinky old gym sock. the texture was like a sock too!

the service was very slow. the wait staff were very insensitive to our needs. we were in a bit of a rush as we were trying to make it to our show. but after eternities of waiting between courses, we still ended up short on time. therefore, we had to skip my favorite part of the meal - dessert.

so we got the hefty bill...and trust me, it was not worth it at all. i would have gladly put that money to playing roullette...even if i put it all on one number, it's got better odds of ""winning"" than todd english's olives."	2	Olives	4
"i must confess that i flirted with the crepe maker, and he hooked me up, twice. strawberries, whipped cream, chocolate sauce all over a silky thin fragrant crepe.

but before i had this little dessert rendevous, i stuffed myself with delicious prime rib, corn-flake fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, fresh crab legs with drawn butter, watermelon mint feta salad, shrimp cocktail, beef noodle soup, green pea risotto with mushrooms, pork shortribs, carbonara tortellini, and a lot more i can't recall. then it was all dessert from then on.

white espresso gelato, the signature wynn candied apple, red velvet cupcake, berry lemon parfait, raspberry cheesecake, chocolate covered marshmallow, strawberry sorbet, chocolate gelato, warm brownie, a huge creme brulee, tres leches...and then i ate those 2 crepes! 

please, don't judge me."	4	The Buffet	3.5
"so very disappointed. bellagio used to be one of my favorite vegas buffets, and now it has been reduced to the worst on my list.

the variety was simply lacking. and worst of all, the quality was abysmal. there was nothing that i wanted to eat, and everything that i did eat was sub-par at best. i was stunned at the fact that the carving station only offers medium or well-done prime rib. it was far too overcooked for my taste, and the carver was rude and unskilled. after asking multiple times to slice the prime rib thinly, he continued to carve 2 inch thick slices to patrons. everyone was frustrated with the carver, his rudeness, and just the appalling waste of food because he was incapable of slicing anything less than a size of a brick.

another shocking discovery was the installation of soft serve machines and the disappearance of hand scooped gelato. this utterly disgusted me and was the final nail in the coffin. who the hell wants drippy icy ooze that melts the minute it hits the bowl? it was worse than the local sizzler.

and there is an average wait of 45 minutes for this atrocity? no thanks."	1	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
"sage fried chicken and waffles.

there is bacon INSIDE the waffles.

heart attack.

i die."	4	Hash House A Go Go	4
"the wait: 45 minutes
the hostesses: they could care less about you
the service: slow but kind. in case you didn't get a big enough dose of waiting, wait some more.
frozen hot chocolate: a pack of swiss miss, blended with ice, topped with redi-whip. the powder lingers on your tongue.
warm crab and artichoke dip: it was not warm. the mayo was overload. but the ciabatta toast points were toasted nicely
bbq chicken and cheddar pizza: where's the chicken? bbq sauce overkill.
decor: cute and meant for tourist shopping.
a return visit: highly unlikely"	2	Serendipity 3	3
"quality and quantity, wolfgang puck delivers.

you can almost anticipate the outcome of your meal from the bread basket alone. parmesan crisps, onion focaccia, and raisin bread, all wonderfully fragrant and fresh. when paired with the rosemary infused extra virgin olive oil, the flavors collide and explode.

special soup of the day was green garlic soup. surprise chunks of portabello mushrooms and tender spears of asparagus heads lay hidden in the velvety rich soup. the garlic was not overpowering, but perfectly spicy. a ring of creme fraiche and some toasted mini croutons round out a perfectly hearty and generous portion.

the calamari fritti with garlic aioli and asian sweet and sour sauce. a side of asian cucumber salad. i must say, it was probably the best calamari i've had to date. crispy and tender, the calamari went extraordinarily well with the smooth garlic aioli. the sweet and sour sauce and the cucumber salad added the asian flare with a kick.

the pasta special was seafood and angel hair cooked in a white wine sauce. the seafood was extremely fresh and the pasta cooked al dente. the sauce was light and appetizing.

hand cut fettucini with mushrooms, fresh arugula, and english peas in a cream sauce. buttery noodles gently caressed in a delicate cream, accentuated with savory mushrooms, peppery arugula, and sweet peas. if it was not hazardous to my health, i wouldn't mind having a large plate of these noodles every night."	4	Spago by Wolfgang Puck	4
"true story:

lotus of siam recommended by fellow yelper jim c.

curries ranging from level 1 to 10 in spiciness.

someone orders level 5, another orders level 10.

i can't handle spicy food, but i brave this one and try the level 5 with a big spoonful of rice. 2 seconds of chewing and my mouth is doused with gasoline and set on fire. 15 seconds later, i get an instant nose bleed.

thank god i didn't try the level 10.

i'm sure everything else tasted lovely, it's just that my incinerated taste buds failed to work after the curry."	4	Lotus of Siam	4
The slut: creamy mashed potatoes and sous vide egg cooked in a mason jar topped with fresh chives and grey salt. Simple, but it was so delicious! The toasted baguette it came with for dipping through the egg was brushed with a very fragrant olive oil. The whole thing was simply perfection. Of course I wish the line was not so long and the self seating area is definitely lacking. But the wait is definitely worth it for that slut!	4	Eggslut	4
best buffet in vegas as of yet. great variety that is individually portioned for grab and go. it's not your typical buffet and the food is pretty good quality. they have amazing mashed potatoes and decent prime rib. the shrimp cocktail is nestled in a cute plastic cup with the cocktail sauce underneath. the fish and chips come in its own little fry basket. rice comes in a chinese to go box. 18 types of gelato and to die for strawberry crisp. i definitely overdosed on the huge chocolate covered strawberries (the kind that sells at godiva for $5 each). the dessert station is nothing less than impressive. my spoon was surely moving at a wicked pace!	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
I already warned by my coworker about the bad service of this location but I said to myself everybody deserve a second chance. Yesterday 07\/16\/17 I ordered factory burrito grande over the phone at 12:13pm and I was told that it would be 15 to 20mins so I went there 5mins early and payed for my order. For a sunday the place not crowded yet because theres no waiting time to be seated for a dining customer. 25mins had passed still my order not ready yet. So I asked the cashier politely "can i follow up my order its been 25mins now?". She said " I will ask the other cashier what's the status"? and never return back to me . Now its more than 30 of waiting, I approached a manager whats going on? He said let me follow up with that , as I looked at him walking towards the kitchen a fellow employee talk to him and forgot bout my order. This location is very disorganize and lack of sense of urgency regarding customer waiting for a long time. i always order food from the ceasars palace brance but their service are always good!!!	1	The Cheesecake Factory	3
Booked a Cabana for the day as we wanted to be able to come and go if we wanted to the Mob Museum and Fremont Street.  Got there at 10:30 and it was absolutely fantastic!  Our server Ashley greeted us as soon as we were taken to our cabana by our Cabana Host Tammy.  Tammy was super attentive to all my emails leading up to our stay.  Ashley was very attentive and checked back every 15-20 minutes to see if we needed anything. When we ordered lunch, she made the guac (was sooo good) right next to us as we were hanging in the pool and allowed us to eat while still in the pool.  She recommended the Egg Salad sliders and those were surprisingly really good. My parents ordered chicken tenders and crab sliders- they loved both of those.  I was worried about the pool temp bring to warm since its been in the 100*s out here, but it was perfect! The pool started to get crowded about 1:30 so that's when we decided to go over to the Mob Museum. When we came back to our cabana, Ashley immediately met us and took our drink and food orders.  Everything we ordered was delicious: chicken skewers, shrimp fritters, mini chicken sliders, marinated shrimp, and chips & guac again.  The pool deck is pretty slippery and to go to the restroom is a bit of a walk. In all, we would definitely book a cabana here again as it was clean, well-maintained, absolutely outstanding service from Ashley, and awesome food!	5	Citrus at the Downtown Grand Pool Deck	3.5
Been here 2x the last 2 days for the official opening days.  Food was outstanding and we didn't wait longer than 15min for food either time.  Team is fast and efficient even though they are learning to handle all the business.  I loved the "Our Burger" and my husband has had the "Donnie BBQ burger" the last 2 days. He loved it.  Onion rings are out of this world and so is the Smores Frappe with marshmallow vodka.  Either visit we were here, we did not have an issues with greasy food at all.	5	Wahlburgers	3.5

Trying to pick up an Uber Eats to go order and it didn't go well. Arrived within 12 minutes of receiving the alert for pick up. It's been almost an hour and still waiting! One of the employees mentioned they do not like Uber. Not sure why, but if another business helps you get more customers then you should greatly appreciate the extra business!! Another fellow U.E. Driver was also waiting quite a while. I love their food but I will definitely not order to go from Khouris. I could have sat down in the restaurant and ordered the food and received it faster than this. Super disappointed. Not sure I'll even come back to eat in the restaurant.	2	Khoury's Mediterranean Restaurant	4
My family and I came here and was greeted very professionally, and seated with a Hispanic male server. Before I knew it he had passed us off to a a white woman server. So the service was quite non chalant. Tina the server treated us okay. She was more of an order taker and did not seem to care about our experience. She never asked if we wanted any appetizers or any bar drinks. That is okay the food was okay but the thing that got me was she was throwing the n-word around like dollar bills at a strip club. I only mention this because me and my family are African-American. Guess we'll never go here again!!!!	1	On The Border Mexican Grill & Cantina	3
I was waiting for the car to the airport and stopped in for a drink and a snack.  Sat at the bar and got a glass of sauvignon blanc and ordered the truffle potato chips.  Truffle anything is good right?  I wish I had known that the chips were going to come drowned in a dip that was well on it's way to gelatenous.   I would have ordered the dip on the side because I hate soggy chips.  The chips were amazing though.  The bartender was great and the perfect balance of chatty but not too much.	3	Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill Las Vegas	4
"I went with a group so the menu was preordered so I didn't get to choose. The dishes were hit or miss, the ones that were good were really tasty, the ones that were bad I can't even remember.
The beef dumplings were incredibly tasty - usually they are just doughy globs.  The caesar salad, although an odd choice for a chinese restaurant, was good - I liked the addition of the wontons and cashews which gave it a nice crunch.  Obviously not traditional but a nice spin, as always too much dressing but......
There was a beef dish with asian slaw - the slaw was fried to make it crunchy which was nice accompanying the beef.
The chicken dish was forgettable - really I don't remember except there were hunks of chicken. 
The leeche martini was so over the top sweet and then the glass rimmed with sugar - I think I went into diabetic shock on this alone."	3	China Grill	3.5
"First we had to wait till 7p to check into our room.  Ok, you've had the reservations for three months how did you not know you had guest coming to your hotel tonight - add more maids to change over the rooms.  
We get to the room and it is any standard motel room.  No coffee pot, fridge, minibar, ipod dock.....really a crappy tv and radio is all you offer?  The bed is super comfy, the towels are stained (yes stained!)
We went to the pool one day and by 9:30a the chairs were all taken, so we got a cabana.  Nice but not worth 400 bucks, the waiter was good though.  The floating river was filthy - empty cups, straws, bottles.  What idiot thought it was a good idea to let a lot of hos and bros trapsy around with their drinks in the water.  It wasn't all drinks either it was full of leaves and debris once around was enough thanks.  Disgusting.  
The hallways are always freezing but the hotel rooms AC doesn't work so great.  
The lions are depressing.
Apparently a very common switch is to say the main tower if full so they send you to the ""upgraded"" West Wing.  What a dump!  The elevators look like beat up old freight elevators.  The poor people on the first floor are in a hallway that leads to the elevators - I'd be pissed if I was them.  And the rooms - you can put in all the leather and all the mirrors you want it won't hide the fact that the room is soooo small the bed blocks the window.  Don't fall for the ""upgrade"".
Actually, remembering that I'm dropping this crap to one star - no one should pay more than 50 bucks a night for the MGM."	1	MGM Grand Hotel	3

Probably one of the best pizza places to eat at especially if you have the late night munchies! Definitly convienient knowing i can order a pizza at 1am if i want. Made my last pregnancy super satisfying when i got to send my bf out to buy me pizza in the middle of the nite lol..

You cant go wrong with the popular $5 hot n ready pizza from lil ceasars! My kids cant wait to get outta school to go get pizza at the end of the week! Then they had to go and 1up their menu with the new $6 bestest pizza! Absolutly amazing.. Such a different taste of pizza.. My family loves it! Only real complaint i would say is outside the building happens to sit a whole lotta loitering homeless folks.. Always beggin for money and surrounding the door usually.. I jus wish they would go loiter sumwhere else considering that parking lot is super small and 9 outta 10times crowded. But hey..the lines inside usually move qyick!!	4	Little Caesars Pizza	2.5
This is by far one of the best mexican food places to eat at! I loved robertos taco shop since i first tried there food... But then i found this even more convienient mexican food shop right nearby where i live.. And i think its waaay better! Great service... Fair prices.. Friendly employees and awesome fulfilling meals! I definitly reccomend eating here!	5	Rubalcabas Taco Shop	4
Fantastic burgers. Time to try the lobster and shrimp sandwich and creme brûlée shake.	5	Gordon Ramsay Burger	4
I had been to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill and loved the Bangers and Mash  with Sticky Pudding for dessert. Here, it's gourmet burgers, specialty fries and beers that can compliment the meal. OK, I left off the jalapeños, but it was still a Hell's Kitchen Burger. I like the spicy ketchup for the fries because of the smokey taste. The burger was great. Only piece of advice for Gordon, coach the staff on what beers\/ales compliment each burger. Yes, the beers on tap change. But the beers you order are their for a reason. Please open a restaurant in Orange County , California. If my suggestion could make you money, I'd love an autographed cookbook.....at least an autographed menu.	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
Amazing pizza!! Amazing service. Deep dish pizza is the way to go! Cheesy garlic bread, mild chicken wings and French fries are amazing! Definitely gonna come back again. Our server Autumn was amazing and attentive. Five stars for sure	5	Amore Taste of Chicago	4
"Had dinner here on a Friday night, everything was pretty good. The bar does a good job with the drinks and is pretty knowledgable. The oysters on the half shell were served with some amazing accompaniments like horseradish sorbet and cognac mignonette. 

The short rib stroganoff was amazing and one of the best plates of food I've had. Very rich, savory, and delicious. The foie gras was mediocre, and not nearly as good as one would expect for foie. They suggest you get about 3 plates per person which seems like a good estimate. 

We finished with the table side bananas foster which was a fun experience. They have a cart with a burner on it and do the whole preparation with the flambé next to you. It's not cheap, but it seems like it would serve 4 people for dessert.

While we were there there was a great jazz band playing. One of them was tap dancing on the piano and it made for a great show during dinner. 

It definitely can get expensive. There were 2 of us and with 6 plates, 5 drinks, and a dessert it came to $350 with tip and tax. For the quality of the food, and keeping in mind it's at a restaurant on the strip, I'd say it was worth it."	5	Rose. Rabbit. Lie	4
"I've gotta say, I've never had such a nice and sincere waiter in my life. He was so patient and helpful, just ugh. So nice. 
As for the food, everything I had was superb. The grilled shrimp though, holy crap. I just can't deal, it was the best tasting shrimp dish I've ever had, just the perfect amount of seasoning and spice. I'm so upset I can't have it every day. So good!"	5	Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill Las Vegas	4
I came with my best friend. The staff was extremely friendly&  helpful I told the cashier it was my first time coming to dine with them and he let me know which was the most popular item etc... food was so good!

"A friend of mine wanted some boba\/tea and since we weren't too familiar with the area I turned to Yelp for help (hah!).  This was the first shop that popped up on the list of suggested places to go to. We figured it had plenty of 5 stars and plenty of reviews. I mean come on, as my friend stated, ""Not a lot of boba places have a 5 star rating"".  So we decided to go. 

This is a small shop. We were lucky that we missed the loooong line that followed us after we ordered. I ordered my usual - iced Thai tea with pudding. Generally the pudding is too hard in most boba spots but this one was soft and pretty tasty, not too sweet. The Thai tea itself was also not too sweet. I really liked it. The boyfriend ordered the passion fruit slushie and he really liked it. I wish I had the chance to taste it but I was really enjoying my Thai tea drink.  Oh and the prepped the drinks pretty fast so you're not waiting around for awhile. 

The only thing about this place that my friends and I weren't too keen about was the cashier. She didn't offer us the frequent buyer stamp card.  She also stamped the one card that we shared only 4 times even though we ordered 6 drinks. When we inquired why she did that she gave some statement about it's not in their policy and then she said something else but we couldn't hear it. Our friend even told her that she lived there and that it's her card but the cashier didn't want to hear it. She wasn't mean or rude about it, it was just a really weird situation. In any case, we are still coming back even after this miscommunication."	5	Brew Tea Bar	5
"Another restaurant at another strip mall in Vegas. My friends raved about this place and suggested that we go here for dinner. We got here before the height of dinner time, which was great since they don't have a lot of seating inside. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted and seated. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is very clean. Oh and plenty of parking in their lot. 

Their menu is not too extensive and prices are fair. When you dine in and you get the sets, you can get free refills for the cabbage salad, miso soup and rice. Their miso soup is excellent and very flavorful The cabbage salad is great with the ume dressing. There's also a side of spicy mustard if you want to dip your tonkatsu in it.  You also get to grind your own sesame seeds before you add the tonkatsu sauce in your dipping dish. That was fun to do!  The boyfriend got the thick cut tonkatsu with curry and rice. The curry was super flavorful and there was a very slight kick to it. His tonkatsu was on the thicker side compared to my friend who got the thinner tonkatsu.  If you order the thicker cut tonkatsu you get one. If you get the thinner cut, you get two. I ordered the tonkatsu set. It came with rice, cabbage salad, miso soup, a side of little pickled onions and three pieces of tonkatsu. The tonkatsu was cooked to perfection. It wasn't dry and not oily at all. The dipping sauce definitely pairs well with the meet. The cabbage salad was great with the ume dressing. Oh and my other friend ordered the set with the ebi and the shrimp was HUGE!  definitely worth the price point. Overall it was a very filling meal. I didn't even finish it. I would definitely go back again since it was really good."	4	Tonkatsu Kiyoshi	4.5
"Located in another strip mall in Las Vegas, you wouldn't guess that this restaurant is actually pretty good.  It was easy to find, and lots of parking.  We were immediately seated - the space is very clean and spacious.  They staff was friendly, super nice and attentive - they provided excellent customer service.

Now onto the food:
The boyfriend and I shared the chicken flautas and the jerk pork hash.  The chicken flautas were amazing.  All the flavors and textures were balanced and it was a good sized appetizer to share with a group of 4 or even 6 people - though you would only get one piece if you shared with 5 other people.  It was a great appetizer to start with.  In addition, my friends enjoyed it so much that we had to order another one to share as a group.

We also decided to share the jerk pork hash.  We decided to order the full size because we thought it was going to be a small portion.  Boy, we sure were wrong about that.  When the meal came, we asked the server to place it in the middle.  We were wrong about that as well because when the server asked where to place the other half, we were dumbfounded.  When we were ordering, I briefly mentioned to our waiter that we were going to share the jerk pork hash.  He took it upon himself to have the kitchen do it for us and they plated it in two different plates.  It's such a small detail, but it surely impressed all of us.  The jerk pork hash had a little bit of a kick to it.  It was flavored well, the portion was huge for a half size, and when I kept digging further down in the bowl, I found the potatoes.  You would think that the potatoes would be mushy but they weren't, however, they were not crispy either.  

Overall, we were impressed by the portion of the meals, the flavors, and the service they provided.  If I was in the area again, I would come back to try other dishes."	4	DW Bistro	4.5
"Came here with a few of my friends and the boyfriend on a very hot Las Vegas morning.  It was a Friday and it was packed!  We waited for a good amount of time but nothing too long.  The hostess seemed a little overwhelmed since he was trying to man the cash register, seat people and get the to go orders all at the same time.  Any case, he got through his list of things to do and we were seated in no time.  The menu is a little overwhelming.  There were so many options to choose from - from adobo fried rice to Portuguese sausage to the variety of pancakes and to sandwiches.  Again, it was overwhelming to choose what to eat!  In any case, we placed our ordered and waited for a good 10 minutes or so and we had our breakfast.

The boyfriend ordered the cookies and cream short stack.  It came with three pancakes and a huge dollop of fresh whipped cream.  As well as a side of cream cheese syrup.  He was in heaven.  He loved every bite of it.  I had a piece and it was just way toooooo sweet for me, but like I stated, it was perfect for the boyfriend.  I ordered Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice.  It was wrapped up in an omelette and I had a side of hash browns.  It was carbs on carbs.  The fried rice was a little too dry for me.  A part of me should have asked (if it was offered and doable) if I could get the eggs over easy.  The omelette was cooked a little too well done and if it was a little runny, it would have been great with the rice.  I love runny yolk with rice.  Overall, the flavor was great, it was a little too dry for my preference.  The other items that my friends ordered looked great and everyone loved their meal.  After it was all said and done, our bill came out to less than $70, which was great considering we ordered A LOT of food.  

Overall, the staff was attentive enough, the food was okay, there are so many options on the menu and the price point is decent.  Would I come back?  Why not.  I would like to try the other options they offer and they sure have on their menu a lot to choose from."	3	Babystacks Cafe	4
"The first time I had Shake Shack was in NYC around 2005\/2006.  I remember that it was pretty good but I didn't want to stand in a long line for it. Over the years I did go several times to the NYC location and the last time I had it was at least 6-8 years ago. So at this visit, I ordered the cheese fries and they were great!  A good amount of cheese on it and the fries were nice and crispy. The chick'n shack was crispy, lots of pickles but the bread was a little too soft to my liking. The boyfriend ordered the shack-cago dog and the double shack burger. He liked both but he really preferred the cheese fries and he ordered another serving!

There was plenty of seating and no long lines at this location. Their facilities were clean and their employees were very friendly. There was a particular employee that was awesome because he asked if we wanted a refill for our drinks, we said yes and he delivered it to us. We didn't even ask. He was awesome!  I would give the service 4 stars and the food 3.5 stars. 

If I was in Las Vegas and around the Summerlin area, I would visit this location again."	4	Shake Shack	3.5
"I've been wanting to try this place out ever since I found out that they are related to Fat Choy's and I LOVE Fat Choy's.  In any case, the friends and I finally had a chance to stop by and we glad that we did.  First of all, we were not at all familiar with the location so we got lost but we eventually found it.  There's not a lot of parking so when it gets busy, it can be challenging.  The space is quite small and it's harder for larger groups to sit together since the premise of this place is to order first and then find a seat after.  If you are a larger group, they try to accommodate you and make sure that your group sits together, which is pretty awesome.  The staff is very friendly and service is on point.  They check up on how things are and they make sure that your water is filled and will ask if you want more sauce.  

Anyhow, as I stated earlier, you order first and their menu is not at all extensive.  They keep it simple so they can work their magic on the items that they do offer.  Some of my friends opted for the chicken and rice (roasted version as well), chicken wings and the bao.  The chicken bao was massive.  It was a little dry for me but you just add some sauce to it and viola!  It becomes awesome.  The boyfriend got the roasted chicken and rice and he really liked it.  He said that his chicken was not dry at all and he especially loved the rice.  I ordered the hainan chicken and rice.  I agree with the boyfriend and the rice was excellent - it had excellent flavor and it was not salty at all.  Who knew that rice would be so darn good?!?  The chicken was moist and had great flavor but you do need the sauces to make it spectacular (at least that's my preference).  If they don't offer you enough sauce, you can always ask for more.  Overall, I really liked the food here, the service was great and the price point is decent.  I would definitely come back here again because I want to try the other items that they have on their menu."	4	Flock & Fowl	4.5
"I never knew this place existed since there's no sign for it, just a long hallway. While my friends knew it existed and they've had it, we decided to brave the long line and grab a few slices.  It was past midnight on a Saturday night and the line wasn't getting shorter as we stood in it. People were passing by us with either slices of pizza or a full on box with a whole pie in it. 

When you get to the front of the line, you kinda ignore the menu that they have and just point out the ones that you like. Come to think of it, I think their menu just states the prices and some options but that's all I could remember. In any case, you choose from a handful of choices then they heat it up for you. Each slice is about $5-$6. A little steep for a New York slice but I get it since there was an ample amount of toppings on it. I opted for the pepperoni & sausage and a slice of just sausage. I had the sausage that night and it was goooood. They have red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese if you choose to top your slice with it. Without it was still pretty delicious. The boyfriend had his the next day.  We heated it up and it was still pretty good. But it's definitely better if it was eaten the same day it was ordered. 

In any case, I would brave the line again and order their other options. It's a pretty good slice of pizza."	4	Secret Pizza	4
"Fat Choy is located in the most random casino off the strip. It's inside the Eureka Casino. A friend of mine told me about this place because she loves their baos. I didn't believe her at first but when I had it a few years back, I had to make sure that anytime I'm in Las Vegas, I have to visit this restaurant just for their baos.  This isn't my first time here and it will not be my last. The service can be a little slow, and the smell of smoke is a little much but I don't mind any of it as long as I get an order of their pork belly bao and Peking duck bao. 

Pork belly bao and Peking duck bao:  They are both very good and flavorful. I do prefer the pork belly bao over the duck because there's more meat on the pork belly. I've had the tofu and mushrooms bao in the past and it was pretty tasty for a vegetarian dish.  If I could eat a lot of these, I would in a heartbeat.  The bun is nice and soft, there's enough sauce and lots of different textures in the dish. I love it!  

Sesame noodles:  I was surprised that I liked this dish. It had a great peanut sauce\/flavor. The noodles were cooked nicely and had a great bite to them. There was a good amount of chopped up vegetables and sauce in this dish. It was enough to share as well. 

Pork belly BLT with fries:  the fries were excellent - crispy and soft. If that's even possible. There was enough pork belly and bacon in this sandwich. The sourdough bread was amazing. It was buttered nicely and it was crispy. Overall it was a really good sandwich. 

5 stars for the baos and basically that's what the 5 stars are for.  Oh and the prices are pretty good for the amount of food that you get."	5	Fat Choy	4
"My friends and I went here for a birthday dinner and it was a pretty good place for a  decent sized party. It's a pretty spacious venue and definitely nicely decorated. They sat our group by the kitchen and most of you would think that being seated there would be annoying but it wasn't. It was fun watching the food getting prepped and such. It definitely was a well oiled machine. Our server was great and all the staff that we encountered were friendly. Now on to the food...

We split four appetizers between 6 people and our server was gracious enough to add to more deviled eggs and biscuits to our order - an order usually comes with 4. 

Deviled eggs - this was delicious. I generally am not a fan of deviled eggs but this was seasoned nicely and the flavor of dill was spot on. 

Kale salad - this dish was okay.  It was lightly dressed, they used baby kale and that's all I really have to say about that.

Mac & cheese - when this item arrived at our table, I wouldn't have thought that it could be split between 6 people. That little mini cast iron sure fed all of us. It was creamy and cheesy and I wanted more. 

Classic buttermilk biscuits - I am also not a fan of biscuits. This however was fluffy, soft and buttery. It also included some butter and jam in cute little jars. Add some of that on the biscuit and darn it, you would want another one. 

On to the entrees. The boyfriend and I decided to share\/split two entrees.  He had the St. Louis style pork ribs - we asked for it to be dry and BBQ sauce on the side. He ordered the full rack and that was plenty for two people. The rub had a nice flavor and the meat fell off the bone.  Dip the meat in some sauce and it was even better. I ordered Llewelyn's fine fried chicken. An order came with a thigh, breast, drumstick and wing. Our server told us that it was a good size serving and boy, it was really a good sized serving. Most of the group ordered this and most of us didn't finish it because it was that filling. The chicken was moist and nicely flavored. I think the only thing that we didn't like about it was that the skin wasn't crunchy enough. But this is just a preference. 

Oh we all ordered cocktails\/drinks and they have a nice selection. I had the southern peach and it was nice and refreshing. Make sure to order one when you dine here. 

Overall, it was great ambience, the staff was friendly, and the food was great.  Also, if I'm ever around one of these establishments, I would go back."	4	Yardbird Southern Table & Bar	4.5
"I was here several times years ago and I was excited to go back. Unfortunately they served me a pile of wet mush. The whipped cream was all melted.  Even though the soggy crepe did still taste good I couldn't eat any of it because there was hair in it. 

Disgusted by the lack of effort to serve something decent."	1	La Creperie	3.5
"First of all I ordered the Pigs in Blanket for appetizer, although plain was quite good. My wife and her friend ordered Scotch Eggs and Deviled Eggs which were better than my app. 

We were only half way through the appetizer when our main course arrived. Myself and my wife's friend had ordered the Fish & Chips. Her chips were cold so got sent back, the waiter was laughing at us as we complained. I ate about half of mine before I could eat no more as it was very greasy. This got sent back also which got taken off the bill which is the least I would expect. 

The only good things about the meal was the beer and the Mushy Peas. So overall Mr Ramsay, if this was supposed to be British Fish & Chips, your chef failed."	2	Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill	3.5
"Gordon had me like Woah!

While we waited for our party to arrive we had delicious drinks at the bar. The ""drifter"" and the ""English garden,"" unique presentation was a nice touch. 

I was eager to try the beef Wellington after seeing him make it on TV.  That was my order and it was not a let down.  Other dishes worth a mention are: the bone in rib eye A+ sides of potatoes and asparagus also deserve an A rating. 

Must also give credit to the wait staff. They were very attentive and helpful.  Our waiter recommended getting the toffee pudding cake for dessert and it was the bomb diggity!

The only negatives are that the menu is a bit too pricey, and the atmosphere is a bit lackluster for Vegas."	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
Eating here was a much better experience than your standard all you can eat buffet. It is far more classy and elegant than the typical Vegas buffet.  They had a pretty large selection of foods. Mostly everything I had was good, but nothing in particular blew me away. The display of the food was magnificent. They made each item feel like you were taking something special.  The carving station had the largest selection of meet I have ever seen served in one place. Dessert items were cute and delicious. I would love to come back one day.	4	Bacchanal Buffet	4
Yum - get my Curry Fix here!  I Love the location too.  This time, I had chicken and tofu saimin.	5	Aloha Specialties	4
Worst service ever....got my order wrong in so many ways. I could see my order sitting there while other people were getting their food. My shake was melting, my chicken nuggets were cold. I didn't even get the dip I asked for. My happy meal was missing the yogurt. They were so slow and backed up that they actually had to stop taking orders just to try and catch up. I have never had a good experience coming to this location. Don't even get me started on the fact that most their employees barely speak English. Not to be racist, but maybe I would have gotten better service if I wasn't white.	1	McDonald's	1.5
Was not impressed...karaoke was more dancing than singing. The place was very smokey. The bartenders weren't very friendly or personable. We had to chase them down and even then they weren't trying to provide good service. I would not recommend this place. Sorry, you failed to entertain.	1	PT's	3
Always been satisfying whenever we eat here. The food is as good as you can get it in chowking philippines. Siomai here is also exceptional than anywhere else we've tried in vegas valley.	4	Chow King	3
Went there yesterday for lunch. The food is alright, in a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 6. If you are craving some tapsilog and such, its a place to go. The serving is kind of small, specially with the desert which a small coned cup of ice cream is $4.( you can buy a half gallon of ice cream for that amount already). The service is slow though...It took 30 minutes or so until the food got to our table. I saw some people that eventually left the place due to the time they waited.	3	Cebu Inasal	3
"Most of the food we got was disappointing for me and my wife to say the least...totally didn't live up to our expectation based on the good reviews we read before getting here. The kangkong and veggies were tasting pale, overcooked and appear to have been cooked hours already before it got served to us, it wasn't at all fresh. The lechon was somewhat tasting like watery, not what I would expect for a slow cooked lechon. I have been to restaurants in vegas that served much better similar food. Out of the 5 items we ordered, we only liked the Pork Isaw...that one I would give to them. 

The portions are reasonable for the prices.
The place is so-so clean and small."	2	Café de Cebu	4
For me, this is the best teriyaki place in vegas valley. I've been to a lot of teriyaki places, some even advertises, but none that I could find is as good as this place's teriyaki. The price are reasonable and portions are big.	5	Yogi's Teriyaki	4
My guy and I fell in love with this place! We went during the Mariachi Brunch on a Sunday. We used a restaurant.com certificate, so we had to spend a minimum of $50, which wasn't that hard. We ordered the sampler platter for the appetizer. Everything was delicious! I loved the nachos and shrimp quesadilla. For entrees, we ordered the carne asada tacos and carne asada from the grill. All of the food was seasoned well and the portions were big. Will return on my next trip to Vegas.	5	T&T - Tacos & Tequila	3.5
This pool was a great time. My friend was unable to get into Wet Republic because he didn't have swim trunks, so we headed over to Liquid instead. We were handed free passes by a promoter on our way over to the pool. We arrived at about 1 pm on a Friday. It took about 5 minutes to get in to the pool. I liked that there was a free check in area for all of our belongings. The pool was on the small side, but they did play a good variety of music. They have a pretty good drink special that comes with a souvenir cup too. Overall, the crowd was friendly and ranged from early 20's to a few 40+. Highly recommended for a laid back, fun pool party.	5	Liquid Pool Lounge	3
Just OK. I think it is a little bit pricy for the quality. It reminds me of an expensive In-N-Out. I liked the topping choices, and I liked the fry choices. I had a medium burger and fat fries! Wait time was a little long for a dead afternoon, but the burger was satisfying.	3	Fatburger	3.5
Came here with the boyfriend for dinner on a Saturday. The line was pretty long but we got seated fairly quick. Food was great. Of course, the highlight of the meal was the crab legs. Sweet, juicy, tender and succulent - just how crab should be. The lamb chops, Kobe top sirloin, prime rib, and beef wellington were also pretty good. For dessert, the creme brule and macarons were to die for. I fell in love with macarons after our dinner here. We were on a time crunch to catch the Jabbawockeez so we didnt get to stay here for too long. Definite must go-to spot if you have a big appetite while  in Vegas. Skip the buffet at Wynn and go here. We tried both buffets and Bellagio's is definitely better! Bigger, better selection of food and our service was outstanding. I loved our server. Very attentive, and has the eyes of a hawk. She refilled our drinks before they were even half empty. Thanks!	5	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
Scouted this place out on instagram & yelp before our trip to Vegas and was very pleased that the reviews seemed accurate. Came in and the place was quiet with only a handful of people already eating. Service was prompt. You order at the counter and theres a selection of ingredients\/toppings to build your menu choice with (I ordered nachos no meat) Came in especially looking forward to trying the elote; which was good. My husband enjoyed his tacos and said the meat was tender and had good flavor. The salsa bar was also a nice feature because I practically drink salsa.	4	Taco Y Taco	4
Blueberry hill has turned into our go to breakfast spot when in Vegas. Nice family dining atmosphere with a variety of menu selections; generous portions and delicious food. Personally love the Oreo pancakes but I've also have had their omelets and crepes. You can tell the food has been prepared with pride in its presentation. I've  been here 3 times and service has been consistently attentive and never a wait to be seated.	5	Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant	4
This place is our "go-to" take out place. It's right by our house and the delivery is fairly quick. They don't speak the best English, but with a little patience the communication is not too difficult. We order the chicken lettuce wraps, crab Rangoon, wonton soup, egg drop soup, chicken chow mien and the beef with broccoli. We haven't ever had a poor meal there, I am unsure what all the bad reviews are for, this place is a hole in the wall, not gourmet Asian cuisine. Service, food, and delivery speed are acceptable	4	China One	3
"This place was great (food\/drinks\/prices), our waiter was not so great. The lady who bussed our tables was AWESOME and took the time to tell us all her favorite things on the menu.

We happened to be there on latin night which was really cool, it was so packed there was nowhere to sit on the patio, but it was no big deal because we got a great view of the amazing dancer. 

Best shrimp tempura I have ever had! Will be coming back to try more items"	4	Firefly	4.5
"This place is AMAZING! I had never had this cuisine before and we tried it on a whim recently (it is in our neighborhood and we wanted to try something new). I have been back 5 times in less than 2 months. 

The food was awesome, the staff is helpful and nice. I like the bar setup also because I can go in during lunchtime by myself and read my book. Love this place!"	5	Fukumimi Ramen	4
"We went to Honey Pig last night for my birthday dinner. The gentleman who was our waiter at first was AWESOME he didn't mind telling us what everything was and explaining what things were. He even brought us a special sauce that was his favorite.

The food was awesome but the reason I give 3 stars is because after our waiter left at the end of his shift, the young ladies who were still working gave less than stellar service. We never had our water or tea refilled and they stood at the counter and stared at us for a good 45 minutes. 

The food is worth it though!"	3	Honey Pig	3.5
"We eat here occasionally, just had lunch the other day. Food was SOLID as always. Unfortunately our server, Christian, I believe his name was was almost unbearable. I have never had poor service here but he definitely made our lunch awkward and his behavior was blatantly even annoying his coworkers. 

My dad will probably never come here again if only to avoid this waiters ""Joe Pesci"" shtick"	3	Egg Works	4.5
Best bbq I have had in town hands down. We had the pick 3 with ribs, hot links and brisket and the catfish plate. Our sides were bbq beans and Mac n cheese. Ribs were falling off the bone and the brisket was tender and juicy. Everything was full flavored and smoky. We do not care for sweet sauce at all and their in house "Arkansauce " was perfectly balanced with heat, vinegar and sugar. There was several nice people working who were friendly and warm without being on top of you while you ate. Very laid back easygoing place we will definitely be coming back.	5	Rollin Smoke Barbeque	4.5
"We used to frequent this location, the last few times we have gone on customer appreciation day (25% off) and the service and food have been less than stellar. 

We ordered chicken gyros and they were dry-- when we asked the waitress for extra tzaziki sauce she had a blatant attitude-- we didn't even mention the food being dry. I was extra disappointed because my mother was in town and I was so excited to bring her to Paymons. 

Another time I ordered a cup of their AMMAAAAZING lentil soup, the waiter brought me a bowl of it, which he insisted I ordered instead of the cup. 

We waited and waited for refills and our bill. As stated above we used to come here all the time but the last few disappointing experiences have deterred me from returning."	2	Paymon's Mediterranean Cafe & Lounge	4
"First choice for ""cheat day"" meal. I have never had a bad pizza here and they give you yummy bread before your meal. 

Sometimes service can be slow but the staff is great other than that."	4	Metro Pizza	4
It's 24 hours.  It has a drive-thru.  And if you feel like being less healthy, it shares space with a donut shop.  Other than that, it's a pretty standard Subway.	3	Subway	2.5
"Very tasty food, great service, super far away, and really too expensive for what you get.  That is the summation of my experience here.

The Chicky Boom and the YaYa were my sliders, and the Chicky Boom is the awesomes.  The service was great, seriously, everyone was super pleasant.  I only went here because I was on my way to Mt Charleston for the weekend and it was a pitstop, so I won't be making my way specifically out to get food here.  The worst part is that it's really too expensive for what you get."	3	Slidin Thru	4
"I frequent this particular PT's pretty often, as it's the nearest one to my house.  But even if it weren't, I'd still come here.

The first time I came here was during the last March Madness to watch the Rebels play (Go, Fight, Win!).  Sadly, the Rebels did not win the game, but hey, who knows what'll happen this season?  But I digress!  It was packed in the main bar area where the Rebel game was playing, so I meandered my way to the restaurant area to watch the game where some other team's fan had set up shop (I don't remember which one).  My friends and I were obnoxious Rebel fans here and through the yelling, we still got pretty great service, particularly considering how packed they were.

That level of service is standard.  Every time I've gone since then, the servers have been attentive and friendly, and beverages and food have been received in a timely fashion.  I've been here during random weekday happy hours and early Sunday mornings to watch football (Go Cowboys!) and never a waiver from the good service.  Oh and shout-out to Becky as she's an awesome server!

Also, the vibe is relaxed and fun and just overall good.  Since the place is relatively new, there's no smell of stagnant smoke lingering anywhere, and the plethora of TVs is much appreciated.  The crowd, from what I've seen, tends to be in the mid 20s to mid 40s and of the working professional bent.  

I dig this place."	5	PT's	3.5
"I enjoy this place.  Given, I've only been here a handful of times, but the times I have been here, they've always been pleasant experiences.  

I've come here to grab some tasty food (the fancy-pants ham & cheese, the mixed greens dressed in some vinaigrette, and the raspberry Italian soda - nom nom nom) and to visit with friends before heading out for the evening.  Y'know how sometimes you feel awkward having a meal by yourself and you default to reading a book and\/or immersing yourself in the news on your smartphone?  No, just me?  Well, I didn't feel awkward here having a meal by myself.  The vibe is relaxed and unpretentious, and there's lots of stuff to take in as far as the decor goes.  And it's great for people watching, both the patrons and the people walking outside."	4	The Beat Coffeehouse & Records	4
"The sushi was warm.

I didn't order baked sushi or tempura sushi either. 

I had to ask for a dish to mix up the wasabi and soy sauce.  

Oh yeah, I ended up sick over night and into the morning after the meal with a very unhappy stomach.  

I wish I could say better things about this place because I've been here before (years ago from the date of this review) and they were good.

But if the expectation now is to get warm sushi that is going to make me sick, no, no thank you."	2	Sushi On Tropicana	3.5
"The concept is awesome, the service is pleasant, the pricing is reasonable, and the product is not too shabby.  

But I wasn't so impressed by the food that I will make a special trip.  Yes, tasty, but not blow your-socks-off tasty."	3	Custom Built Pizza	4.5
"Bento box, bento box, bento box!  

This place makes me happy with its tasty food, its quick service, it's pleasant customer service, and most of all its proximity to my house.  My favorite dish here is the garlic noodles with gyoza, the filet, and the greens salad with ginger dressing - nom nom nom. 

Only downside is that it's closed on Sundays."	4	Volcano Grille	4
"Emeril's has been bookmarked for a while so I was excited that my boss wanted to eat here.  I stayed at the MGM so it was awesome that we just had to go downstairs for dinner.  The circular bar is at the entrance of the restaurant and the bar staff was pretty friendly.  I arrived early at around 7pm and the restaurant looked about half empty so I was a little confused to why a 7pm reservation wasn't available.. weird.  The decor was nice but you could get away with jeans and a polo; the two walls enclosing the restaurant were lined with bottles of wine.

For starters, we ordered the Calamari and the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp.  The calamari was tender and crispy, but nothing spectacular.  The BBQ shrimp were wild blue shrimp-- again, very tender and the BBQ sauce wasn't too heavy.

I knew I would order a fish entree since this is a fish house, and I freaking love fish! 

I was torn between the pan roasted sea bass, the whole grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass, and the whole grilled American Black Bass.  Our waiter Gus was really helpful and suggested the whole grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass.  The two Bass's were market price, so I knew they would both be pretty fresh.  

I was pretty shocked when the fish came out because it was a lot bigger than I had anticipated-- the bass barely fit on my plate and it literally was the whole fish!  The grilled\/charred criss-crossed skin looked great (I love charr!) and the bass was Citrus and Herb stuffed with Chardonnay Agrodulce.  The whole fish was perfectly cooked-- very juicy and flakey!  The best part were the cheeks, charred skin, and the belly (i love the fatty part).  I ate it all.

The Wine menu was huge compared to the food menu so we had to ask the sommelier to help us out.  Our table ordered all different entrees: fish, etouffee, and steak, so he suggested we go with a Pinot Noir.  We ordered a bottle of the 2010 A.P Vin.  I was surprised that the wine wasn't corked; it was a screw top which I thought was odd.  The wine was pretty fruity and paired nicely with our entrees. 

For Dessert, I had the Banana Cream Pie.  YUM!  I love how they use whole slices of banana instead of mashing the banana in with the filling.  The pie was garnished with caramel sauce and chocolate shavings.  The ratio of the pie was 50% banana, 50% cream, so I didn't feel too guilty about polishing it off.

I tried some of my co worker's Frozen Key Lime Mousse Pie.  If you like tart, you will love this!  The creamy part of the pie and the coconut cookies mellows out the tartness of the frozen lime.  It also comes with a Mandarin orange coulis(a pureed sauce) which helped balance out the sweet and sour-ness of the pie.

I'm definitely coming back here to try the other seafood dishes!"	4	Emeril's New Orleans Fish House	3.5
This was my first time having tapas and I am definitely coming here again the next time I'm in vegas! Not too pricey either. It's good to go with some friends and order a bunch of plates to share! The shrimp and filet mignon skewers were to succulent, flavorful, and very well cooked.. I'm salivating as I yelp! Check this place out for sure!	5	Firefly	4.5
"YESS!  

A legit,  24 hour, Pho spot in Vegas that is just a cab ride away from the strip!

Me and my friends came here at 4am after a night out and we were starving!  On a scale of 1 to 10 my level of excitement was 11.  Upon entering, one thing turned me off.  The smell!!  It smelled like they've used the same old, dirty, moldy, rag to wipe down the tables for 100000 years without washing it. The whole restaurant had an old wet towel smell to it.  Regardless, I was still excited to eat. 

I ordered the Rare Steak and Brisket Pho  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=9hI7mkZ4PHU7SjC5hxZqLA#Q1aVULe4TLE41w5R-r7gWg).  The broth was flavorful, refreshing, and not too oily.  The brisket and steak were perfectly cooked and tender.  They gave me a generous amount of noodles too!  Don't forget to ask for the side of sliced onions!  Maybe it's just  a Korean thing and we're trying to make ghetto-kimchi, haha.  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/pho-kim-long-las-vegas?select=9hI7mkZ4PHU7SjC5hxZqLA#osrvZk6r45zRC0stiCZ0tQ) 

I wouldn't recommend the chicken pho... I tried my friend's chicken pho and it just tasted like salty water-- where's the chicken flavor hmmm?"	4	Pho Kim Long	3.5
"I came here for lunch on Wednesday and it wasn't busy.  The decor was nicer than your usual sports bar and had an Italian feel to it.  There were probably 2-4 other tables being served.  The service was great-- our waitress was helpful and friendly.  We were offered a sample of the pork and cabbage soup; the soup was flavorful and the pork was really tender.

The menu was pretty extensive-- salads, soups, pastas, pizza, fish, sandwiches, burgers. They had lunch specials ($7-9) along with a page of $10 specials.  I really didn't know what to order because there were so many choices!  It also made me a little nervous of which items are actually good.  I ordered the pan seared tilapia off of the $10 specials.  It came with pasta and sauteed baby spinach. I was hoping the sauce would be more clear rather than creamy, but I loved that they were generous with the capers.  The tilapia had a nice crust on it but had sort of a muddy\/earthy taste to it.  I wasn't too concerned because tilapia sometimes tends to have this taste

http:\/\/s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/CrVSGXEBTklHdTOoEt1vuQ\/l.jpg

The salads my co workers ordered looked pretty tasty.  The antipasta salad came with cured meats and the caesar salad came with a whole grilled chicken breast.  Another co worker ordered the wrap, but the wrap looked small with the huge pile of potato chips that came with her order.

Overall, the service was great , the restaurant is clean and the food wasn't too bad."	3	Giuseppe's Bar & Grille	3.5
"I came here with my boss for dinner on weeknight for some tapas and it wasn't too busy-- we were seating right away at the bar. 

This is located in the Aria hotel downstairs and it's pretty easy to spot. The decor is very modern and trendy-- fake trees (looks like cherry blossom trees but no blossom), colorful striped wallpaper, and the walls are all made out of glass.

-  Imported Spanish ""Pata Negra"" ham (""the most delicious ham in the world""): slices of beautiful pata negra, served with toasted bread and garlic tomato sauce. WOW. Im glad I got to try this! Wayy better than any other cured meats i've tried! A bit pricey for 10 small slices but definitely worth it!

- Olives: The assortment of olives was a good choice! All super fresh and nice to nibble on while we enjoyed the other plates and drinks. 

- Cheese Platter: Cana de cabra (soft goat's milk), one year old manchego (sheep's milk), Cabrales (cow's milk), La Serena (soft sheep's milk), and some sweet pasty looking thing that tasted like dried figs. Served with toasted bread. Great selection of cheese for the platter-- there was a soft cheese, mild cheese, a more pungent cheese, and a dense cheese. The sweet fig paste paired nicely with the saltier cheeses

- Spanish Tortilla: Not your typical flat sheet of tortilla! This one is at least 2 inches thick, soft, and made out of potatoes, onions, and eggs. You can taste the soft chunks of potatos an egg-- very tasty and savory.

- Sauteed Foie Gras: I HAD to order foie gras since I wasn't in CA. A slice of foie with a sauce that tasted like balsamic vinaigrette, served on toast and chickpea mash. I wish the slice of foie was bigger, but all 2 bites were amazing! Super rich and creamy. 

- Santiago's cake: A slice of almond cake, turron ice cream. This wasn't as memorable as the other dishes but the cake was super moist and the ice cream paired well with the cake (turron is an ice cream made with almonds).

Nice place to grab some BOMB Spanish Tapas if you're staying at Aria\/Vdara!"	4	Julian Serrano Tapas	4
"Cute, delicious desserts as well as salads, paninis, and sandwiches!

The desserts look way better than the savory food, but still delicious. The display tempts you to want to order everything!

Located in the Aria\/Vdara hotel near the casino-- a bit pricey ($12-15 for a salad\/panini) but it's vegas, so I won't complain

I stayed at Aria for my most recent visit, so I came here for breakfast and lunch every day, haha. I wanted the breakfast panini but they were sold out, so I ordered the ham & cheese croissant-- more like a sandwich, but the croissant was very buttery, flakey, and soft. The cheese was perfectly melted! 

Asian salad was good, and had a nice serving of shrimp.

Prosciutto Panini: fresh ingredients, delicious prosciutto"	4	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
"HAKKAWHAAAAT!  

I came here with my girls the night after they opened (April 19) and we were super excited to check out the new club everyone has been hyping up.  

My first impression upon entry was that it reminded me of Marquee's layout -- the stairs, stage\/dance floor layout, and tables.  Unlike Marquee, there seemed to be more tables located near the back of the club, as well as some standing room.  But I do not recall there being an outside patio.  

I feel like your experience here (as well as at any club in Vegas) depends on the DJ, who you're with, if you have a table, and if you're on a good level.  Hardwell was performing the night we went (YES!), I was with a good group of girlfriends (YES!), we had a table (YES!), and we were all on a great level (YES!).  We had Dom in one hand, light-up baton in the other, and danced the night away  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hakkasan-las-vegas-nightclub-las-vegas-2?select=TlKuPAyQGHWSyHKAWlenig#JLdHcSRynz3EI7ZnGO3QxA).  In conclusion, we did have an amazing time, haha.  

We did try going on the dance floor but it was soooo packed!  People bumping into me left and right, it felt like I was dancing with 20 people at once.

Overall, Hakkasan was good, but not mind-blowing.  I was expecting something totally new but this club will be pretty crackin since they've got all the sick DJs!!"	4	Hakkasan Nightclub	2.5
"My VEGAN friend was super ecstatic about trying this spot because Stephen Wynn is a vegan, and makes sure to cater to his vegan diners by including several delicious vegan items on the menu.  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/society-cafe-encore-las-vegas-5?selected=ioydFITdh8ro4athiyFpmg#P0Bs-nU3tTYV5llJ6LfRVA)

Me and my friends came here for a dinner on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy-- we were seated right away.  Our server was friendly but our food took a little longer than expected, considering that it wasn't too busy.  Although my hungover-ness may have lowered my level of patience.  I usually don't eat the complimentary breads but the pretzel bread sticks were pretty good!  Warm, soft, and it was served with a soft butter sauce. 

I ordered the Sirloin Burger w\/ Bacon, Mushroom, Swiss, and a Fried Egg  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/society-cafe-encore-las-vegas-5?selected=ioydFITdh8ro4athiyFpmg#xOPsNVMYXtsQH4KmFRHcrg).  It was an average burger-- I wish the burger patty had more flavor; it was just a big boring patty.   I ended up just picking at the burger and ate the mushrooms, bacon, and egg.  The price was decent: $15 and $1 extra to add an item.  $3 to add a fried egg is a little too much, don't cha think?"	3	Society Cafe Encore	4
"My visit to Oscar's was my first time in the old town Las Vegas.  The restaurant seated us at one of the window seats in their ovular shaped dining room.  We were able to gaze out the window at how different everything looked compared to the main Las Vegas Strip.  The decor was definitely old school-- it felt like I went back into time to the 80's. 

We came here for Prime Rib.  We all went with the Bone-in PRIME RIB Special, and we were not disappointed.  The prime rib is HUGE!  I shared this with one of my girl friends and we couldn't even finish.  The meat was super tender, juicy, and the crust was nicely seasoned (I love this part of the meat!).  There was just the right amount of au jus on the prime rib, and was served with a creamy horseradish sauce.  For the size and quality, I'd say this is a great deal!

We shared a few sides as well: Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Creamed Spinach, and Sweet Potato with a Jalapeno Butter sauce.  My favorite side was the lobster mashed potatoes, but I wish there were bigger chunks of lobster in it in stead of shredded pieces.  The creamed spinach was good, but there was nothing special about it.  The sweet potatoes weren't very tasty.. it's pretty much 3 gigantic sweet potato fries, served with some sweet\/watery sauce.  It did not taste like buttery nor jalapeno-- I wouldn't recommend this side. 

If you ever visit old town Vegas, be sure to stop by Oscars for some Prime Rib!"	4	Oscar's Steakhouse	4
"I checked in on Tuesday and it wasn't too busy-- we were able to check in without waiting in line for more than a few minutes.

I stayed in a single room and it was pretty nice.  MGM has definitely upgraded since I stayed here a few years ago.  I remember that the blinds and curtains had to be opened\/closed manually so I was happy to see this change.  

I was happy with everything about the room except for two things:

1.  It took me a while to find the light switch.  There is a switch for the small hallway when you enter, and then you have to turn on each of the 3 lamps around the room.  I wish there was just one switch on the wall to turn on\/off the lights.  

2.  The cable connection kept getting disconnected!!  I stayed up until about 4am watching tv and the cable turned off at least 4 times!  The cable was off for just a couple of minutes but it was pretty annoying.  I usually don't watch tv while I'm in Vegas, but the one time I do it sucked, haha. 

Despite these 2 things, I did like that MGM had a casino downstairs with tables starting at $15 for blackjack.. although I did not do well this trip, haha."	3	MGM Grand Hotel	3
"Super excited to try another restaurant by Mario Batali!

We were a little early for our reservations so we ordered a drink at the bar seating area while we waited. I ordered a Hen n coke as usual, but this bar is super top shelf! The ""cheapest"" Hennessy they had was XO, not even VSOP lol. I would have ordered something else if I knew it would be $45 -____-. 

I came here with my boss and co-worker for dinner and we all chose one of the tasting menus. I went with the ""Whole Hog"" Pasta Tasting Menu with the Riserva Wine Pairing - a 7 course meal, each with a different wine! Each dish highlighted a different part of the pig with a different type of homemade pasta. ($105 per person plus $115 per person for the Riserva wine pairing-- $75 for the regular wine pairing)

Our server was super helpful and explained each dish, as well as the wine pairing. Service was superb and speedy. 

- Complimentary Chickpea Bruschetta: Seasoned chickpeas topped on toast-- good but not as good as what we were about to feast on!

- Minestrine di Torrellini: A nice start to the meal, super flavorful broth! (paired with a 2009 La Mozza)

- Pizzoccheri with Roasted Pork Shank: Flat and wide squid ink pasta with a light sauce-- the pieces of pork shank were super tender and succulent. (Paired with a 2008 Sicilian wine - Etna Piosso)

- Pork Raviollini with Roasted Flamme Tomato Passato: The tomato sauce was bursting with flavor! I could tell that the sauce was made with super ripe and fresh tomatoes and tasted great with the tender pork.  (Paired with a 2007 Monti Garbi)

- Fettuccine with Norcinio Ragu Pork: A lighter, opaque sauce and fettuccine with pieces of the pork's kidney, liver, and heart. You really do get to taste various parts of the pig-- I couldn't tell what each piece was but they were all tasty. (Paired with a 2008 Rubbjano).

** I was already pretty full and buzzed at this point, so don't let the small servings fool you! **

- Black Spaghetti with 'Nduja and Sicilian Pesto: 'Nduja is a spicy, spreadable sausage that is made of different parts of the pig (shoulder, belly, jowl, tripe, spice mixture). The pasta was a little too spicy for me but still killed it (silician pesto contains red pepper). I love the texture of the squid ink pasta because it adds a different, more firm texture. (Paired with a 2007 Cannonau di Sardegna)

- Pear Sorbetto: OMG the best pear sorbet I've ever had! My first bite tasted like I took a bite out of the sweetest, ripest, asian pear! Super light and refreshing, which was amazing after having the spicy spaghetti prior. (Paired with a 2010 Dindarello)

- Chocolate Budino with Huckleberry Sauce: It kind of looks like a souffle but it's actually a creamy custard\/pudding. Super moist, fluffy, and not too sweet! The huckleberry sauce tasted amazing with the dessert.  

** Literally felt like I was going to explode at this point **

- Then the server brings out a complimentary assortment of mini dessert cookies along with a shot of a super sweet dessert liquor. A bit too sweet for my liking, but we appreciated it! 

Overall, a wonderful dining experience with great service! I gotta come back here to try items on the regular menu."	4	B&B Ristorante	3.5
"Yay, I finally get to cross ""Lobster Me"" off my list of spots to try on the strip! 

 It's located conveniently next door to Fat Tuesdays, so this could be a good place to grab a bite before those icey dranks.

The Seafarer Lobster Roll (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lobster-me-las-vegas?select=k8BD5TlnoDu7V5nB5-ra5A#cV_H97p1lnoZOclyl1LJ1g) caught my eye because it had some veggies mixed in with the lobster.  (Lobster and seafood salad with mayo, cucumber, celery and green onion).  I like how the roll is buttered and toasted, but I wish there was more lobster in the roll! I was expecting big chunks of lobster but instead got minced pieces of lobster.  I'll definitely get a bigger roll next and share a few items with some friends. 

Altogether, it was alright-- not sure if i will ever be craving this though."	3	Lobster ME	3.5
"For the LOVE of FOIE!!

I knew I had to make a trip to out Bachi Burger the next time I was in Las Vegas when I heard about the Shogun Burger!

I could tell that this restaurant was not your ordinary burger joint after taking one glance at the menu.  This is one of the more modern restaurants that serve types of burgers you would not typically find at your local burger joint.  Bachi Burger offers various Japanese-inspired burgers, dishes, and sides. 

The SHOGUN BURGER consists of Wagyyu Beef & Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, and Yamamomo Peach  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=Xc_YmEWXC7Rmv-9fncsOGA#Xc_YmEWXC7Rmv-9fncsOGA).  To be honest, my first bite was a little overwhelming from all the different flavors going on, lol.  But all the flavors melded together perfectly.  The wagyu beef was tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  The sweetness and tender poached Asian pear.  The rich, pan seared, slice of foie gras.  All of this, drizzled in miso butter, topped with arugula, in between a home made sweet bun  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=W9bCuQYgNjg2W-Fb2BBDkw#W9bCuQYgNjg2W-Fb2BBDkw).  Foie is already very rich to begin with, so I was not able to finish this burger in one sitting-- especially since we ordered sides as well.

I tried some of my friend's CRUSTy CRAB Burger, but the burger was too salty for my liking.  It was difficult to taste all the flavors and ingredients in the burger but it wasn't too bad.  (Crab cake burger with mango chutney and tartar sauce).  The concept of making a ""Spongebob-type"" burger is cute though.  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=JHZOUMJ4_JqyKjvo6aHHzg#JHZOUMJ4_JqyKjvo6aHHzg).  

The SWEET POTATO FRIES were fresh, crispy, lightly salted, and served with a Yuzu Citrus Aioli dipping sauce  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=xgwqimbyTmxJTnzr7bRITg#xgwqimbyTmxJTnzr7bRITg).  If you are  afan of sweet potato fries, you will not be disappointed!

The TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES were delicious.  Made with fresh cut potatos, tossed in white truffle oil, parmesan reggiano, porcini cream, served with sun dried tomato aioli  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=QgvNAbzuAF7sNnz7TpFy0g&userid=F28n26ynklEioZDInyK__A).  

If I weren't so full I would have ordered a few more items on the menu that made my mouth water:  the Peking Style Duck Steamed buns, Pork Belly Steamed Buns,  and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  But that's just a few more reasons to come back! Woohoo!"	5	Bachi Burger	4
"I came here for a late lunch on Tuesday with my work so it wasn't busy.  PT's is the first bar\/restaurant I've been to off of the Las Vegas strip, so it was nice to see another side of Vegas.  Initially, PT's reminded me of BJ's except that PT's has a separate dining room\/section from the bar and slot machines. 

They serve American foods: salads, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, wings, pizza, fried chicken.  I noticed that they also serve BUCKETS of sliders, haha.  Must get that next time... 

I ordered the bbq chicken salad.  I liked that they used mixed greens and mixed the bbq\/ranch dressing into the salad for you rather then having it on the side.  The grilled chicken was pretty dry so I probably won't order this again.  My boss ordered the bbq chicken salad as well but he had them serve it in a wrap, which I would suggest because it comes with a side of fries. Someone else ordered a burger, which looked pretty tasty.

I've heard some good things about their happy hour, so I'll probably come back during those hours the next time I'm in the area."	3	PT's	3.5
"I had 2 and a half hours to kill so I'm glad that the airport had a bar with draft beer.  The food didn't look too great-- the person next to me was eating tacos but it had a weird smell to it.. like old meat.  I'm glad I wasn't hungry.. haha.  

I sat at the bar, which was pretty full and ordered a few Draft Stella's.  The beer was good and the bartender was nice.  He informed me that we are allowed to walk around with our beers in the airport terminal which was awesome.  I had the bartender put my last beer in a plastic cup so I could walk around.  Each beer was about $9, kinda pricey but it's an airport so I wasn't trippin."	2	Jose Cuervo Tequileria	2
"I went back to this place last night after writing this review and the restaurant reached out to me to apologize for their service. Mike has since taken over as a manager and they have done a lot of changes there. He came over and apologized for my last visit and we did have a great experience there. So j would recommend going back to this place because their food is really good and they have taken steps to improve their service. You can see my previous visit below that they made up for. 


I'm not one to usually post a bad review but we come here pretty often for dinner because we really enjoy their food, but tonight was our worst experience we have had at this place. When we received our water it was served to us in plastic cups with no ice for dinner at 9:30pm. When we asked the manager she told us it was because they can't have people stealing their glassware with the night crowd. Didn't know we looked like we were going to steal anything, especially since we were sitting down for dinner and the two tables that sat down behind us got regular glassware. Then I asked for a margarita, which was served water down horribly and wit no salt which he ran off before he could even ask me if I wanted it. Then out meal came out before our table side guacamole which I server was serving himself. Not to mention he have it to us without chips or anything. I guess you are supposed to eat it with a fork. Then it took forever to find our server again just to get out of the place. Never felt so unwanted in a restaurant before. Even the manager didn't care. Stood up for her terrible server who had a terrible attitude the whole time. Sad to say it will be a while before we go there again.  Might sit at the bar next time. At least there you always have someone in front of you and they give good service."	5	Chayo Mexican Kitchen + Tequila Bar	3
This is my favorite lounge spot in town! Tuesdays is locals night and they offer 1\/2 off appetizers and cocktails. I love their Sailor Jerry Babylon Spice!

Draw backs to this place- it's a small venue, so expect to be packed into a small table and the service is hit or miss. Otherwise, the food is awesome and worth the trip off the strip!"	4	Firefly	4.5
This place is in our neighborhood, but I would rather drive miles away to have better sushi. We got there at 3:05pm and saw their sign for Lunch All You Can Eat for $19.99 and confirmed the price with the waitress... we sat down and the waitress took our order. The sushi was pretty bad (I've had better from Smith's deli) and our bill was for $55! She said since we got there 5 minutes after lunch that we were charged for the dinner price. It was our fault for not asking, but she should have mentioned it when we ordered.	2	Xtreme Sushi	3.5
2 words... Osso Bucco. Best in town! Wait, best ever! I usually have to call to see if they're offering it for the night, but it's phenomenal! No joke. It's fantastic.

Worst experience I've ever had at an establishment. When you walk in nobody greets you, they just stare at you until you order. It's actually quite awkward. None of the ingredients are fresh, avocados were old and brown, shrimp tempura is soggy, all the fish were dry and had a very strong fish odor to them, this list can go on and on. Just don't go here.

"Like many of you, I was initially turned off to trying this place out because of the ridiculous line that stretches out to the parking lot. FYI that line continues once you reach the inside of the establishment for another 15 minutes at peak hours.

So what's this place have? All sorts of meat. They also have a salad section, but the workers there look pretty lonely because who craves salad at a meat buffet? The dessert section is also pretty nice. I appreciated the scoop of mint and chip ice cream, and many people partake in the cotton candy post meal. 

Getting down to the nitty gritty: I'm a rib guy, but the ribs were just average here. When an entree is great, you are already planning on getting your next portion while eating your current portion. No such feelings here. 

The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC. One thing about the steak though:  

I don't know if the steak chef is color blind, or if he simply does not give a flying caboodle. On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate. I could swear my plate was mooing back at me.

Also, if you aren't familiar with buffet culture...the clientele can be a little eccentric. If you generally don't see strange people in public, that's because they are all here at GC. 

Yes the quality was better than Hometown. No the quality was not better than a Vegas buffet\/Morongo buffet. For the price of entry, I'd say you come out a little bit ahead if you plan your meal right. I'm not a buffet fan, so I'd come here 1-2 times a year maximum."	2	Golden Corral	3
Terrible experience.  We ordered through Grub Hub for delivery.  The order was missing potato salad and peach cobbles.  We called the restaurant to advise of missing items & they said we had to order more food & they would throw our missing items in.  I'm sorry, why do I have to pay more to the items I already paid for??  They have us a new phone number to call, we call and guess what?  They refunded us for the missing items.  While grateful to be reimbursed, the point was to get the damn food.  By the way, the food was NOT that good.  Will never order or go here again.	1	Granny's Kitchen	4

Maybe we should get the two scoops we pay for and just waisted ,the manager says she doesn't make the rules ""this is JEAN PHILIPPE!!!

"This place is wonderful...it is open until 4 AM!!!
Pizza is really delicious and if u go for the Happy Hours and after 11 pm pizzas and everything from their bar menu is half off....
We really enjoyed dining at fire pits on the patio with our dog...it was like having a mini vacation....we just love it."	5	Mr B's Bar & Grill	4
First we went there by recommendation and we ordered the sampler pierogis. It was a mix of the potato, meat, and sauerkraut. The meat was so flavorful. We ordered sour cream to go along but we didn't use it cause everything was amazing by itself. They were amazing!! Everything tastes homemade and made very well, you can tell they make their food with love and truly enjoy what they do. The owners are absolutely amazing, they are from Poland and are a total joy to talk to. The place is clean and the food was very fresh. I will return and highly highly recommend this place to anyone who loves homemade food and just wants something different. And I heard they will be extending their hours in the evening as well.	5	Pierogi Cafe	4.5
Waited 30 min for a table for 4 at around 8pm. Ordered appetizers: steamed potstickers, agedashi tofu, tempura shrimp, fried vegetable spring rolls, and a Malaysian pancake with curry dipping sauce. Very tasty appetizers. I also ordered the beef penang fried kway teow noodles. It was ok. But I think I was happy with just the appetizers. The sweet and spicy noodles was too sweet	4	Noodles	3
This is our 2nd time going there. First time we had pizza only and it was amazing and the price wasn't too bad considering how big and tasty it was. This time we ordered a few extra things. We got a ham and onion pizza again and as before amazing. I ordered mozzarella sticks, which I later found out we're homemade. They were bomb!! And the marinara sauce to go with them even more bomb. Couldn't get enough to tell you the truth, I would eat the marinara sauce with a spoon it was so good. We also ordered wings. The wings were dry and if you want extra ranch or blue cheese for a little container they want $1. Which is a little much, it was good but not worth that price. I will order again from this place but I'll stay away from the chicken wings. Pizza and mozzarella sticks are bomb, once again!! Went for a third time and had calamari so yummy and they aren't over cooked even on the second day reheated they were good. And the marinara is still amazing!!	5	Rocco's	4
So my family and I just ordered Gyros. Worst meal we have ever had!!!!!!  We call  to inform the manager and all he did was argue with us that he has the best gyros in town. Worst food, the salad was even bad. Will never order from here again, not only because the food was bad but so was the customer service from the manager!!	1	Alexander's Pizza	3.5
This was our first time visiting, and our last. We had hard tacos, an enchilada, chips, and a burrito. Everything fried was super greasy and you could taste that the oil they used was super old. The enchilada was a soft taco with sauce on it. The burrito was bland and nothing special. Definitely not a second timer. I would have had better food at taco bell next door, and for cheaper.	1	Tacos La Mexicana	4
New and hot is not at all what this place is. The food was terrible and so was the service. I ordered 3 soft tacos and the hubs ordered a burrito. First you could tell they started with more meat with the first taco and got progressively less. I also asked for green sauce on top, didn't get any, I originally asked for pico and she didn't say not but tried to steer me way. The husbands burrito was bland and had very little meat in it. Considering they just opened and are by a movie theater they would step their game up but no they fell flat on their faces. It's over priced and under whelming.	1	Pepe's Tacos	3
I really enjoy the teriyaki chicken & rice bowl from here, I have never been disappointed with it. I do find the prices a tad bit high for what you get but the consistency of the food makes me want to continue to order from here.	4	Teriyaki Madness	4
This place has great food, great atmosphere, outrageously good prices, it's clean and the staff is generally good & friendly. Occasionally they place will be overwhelmed with customers and the service slips a little but the food doesn't. I have eaten here many many times and my favorites are the green iced tea, chicken teriyaki bento box, LF ramen, california rolls, the fried beef dumplings (I can never remember the name of) and the cucumber salad. They didn't have all you can eat sushi or alcohol when I first started eating there but they do now. The worst things I could say about this place (the reason for the non-five start rating) is the music is sometimes to loud, it can be warm in there, some of the staff don't speak or understand English very well and like I mentioned before, when they get busy the service can suffer but the food is more then reasonably priced and yummy so I forgive them and will continue to keep going there.	4	Lucky Fish Sushi & Grill	3.5
The food I had was OK but not great. We had to ask for everything we needed from other employees that seemed to be floating around the restaurant not doing much else other then saying they would let our server know.... I don't think they ever did because the same server only visited our table twice after we ordered. We got our appetizers, mains and sushi all in one, it wouldn't even fit on the table unless we took off the candle and yet the waiter just kept shoving stuff on the table. We never got drink refills till he came to give us our check. I'd never go back, the service was not good at all.	2	Kabuki Japanese Restaurant	4
I don't understand why this place gets good reviews, their food is mediocre at best. I have eaten here 5 times now (the people I live with keep ordering from there other wise I would have eaten there once only) and had a variety of things and the meats always taste reheated\/microwaved the beans are dry and the rice is flavorless. Seeing how so many people like this place I never bothered to throw in my 2¢ about it but the last order I got was the beef tacos and one had half a splintered tooth pick in it that nearly went through the roof of my mouth! Now today with a sore mouth I'm writing this to warn others, the people who work there are nice but clearly do not care about the food they are serving.	1	Roberto's Taco Shop	3.5
Tasty food, generous portions, excellent prices, quick & friendly service. No complaints, I have never had a bad experience here and have always enjoyed the food.	5	Ohana Hawaiian BBQ	4
"Avoid this place, get a TV dinner it'll be better!

We ordered chicken fried rice, pork lo mien and sweet and sour chicken. Those three things came to over $25 and they ""forgot"" to include the free dim sum, which is probably best since their food is horrible.

The sweet & sour chicken was the worst I've ever had. The meat had a funny aftertaste, the outside was dry and way to much of it and the sauce tasted like rancid candy. It was obviously made with canned juice... we could taste the can. The sauce was in a tub on it's own which was fine but the dozen or so battered chicken pieces came on a bed of slimy raw vegetables. There was so little meat we would have felt ripped off for what we paid for this dish even if there had been a decent amount of the chicken.

The fried rice was mushy and tasted more like steamed rice with soy sauce on it then fried. There was no egg in it and the vegetables in it were under cooked (my guess is strait from a bag of frozen mixed veg and not cooked first) and the meat had that funny after taste in addition to being slimy and gummy like it wasn't the first time it had been reheated.

The lo mien was really really greasy, the chicken in it was all badly cut up and most of it was in a solid clump on the bottom. It looked like someone tried to cut up a chicken thigh but never made it all the way though the meat. Again, the meat had that weird after taste (like it was reheated in the microwave) and it was slimy.

The delivery took over an hour, the food was barely warm, the delivery guy himself was pleasant enough but that's not saying much when everything else was just horrible. We would never eat food from this place again!"	1	China Ginger	3.5
"The Hilton is an older casino near the strip and showing its age. It is not directly on the strip, rather it is closer to the convention center, a block or so past the Wynn heading away from Las Vegas Blvd. I have not stayed in the rooms here.

The Star Trek themed part of the casino is interesting. I went on the Star Trek experience ride before several years ago -- It was entertaining. The buffet at this Hilton is a good deal at under $20. 

As a Vegas arcade connoiseur I find the Hilton's arcade to be lacking. It is tiny and does not have much variety.

My gf and I stopped at Grimaldi's on our way to Los Angeles and it was just as delicious as the Brooklyn location, which I thought was excellent! I would recommend Grimaldi's to anyone who enjoys quality pizza. We ordered a white with garlic medium with pepperoni, artichoke, olives, and Italian sausage. We also got a small Caesar which was average. We were not at all disappointed with our visit to Grimaldi's.	5	Grimaldi's Pizzeria	4
In my opinion, the very best items at the buffet are the following: duck, waffle fries, sausage(not the jalapeño), burger shooters, miso soup self serve, crepes and lastly the sorbet. I appreciated the selection and the exotic foods, but some were mediocre. I am especially picky because I pride myself on eating excellent food on vacations, and with that said, I feel that most of the food could be better. The service was excellent; I enjoyed having the coffee pot at our table as well.	4	Bacchanal Buffet	4
We came in for a late lunch and I must say this place is very clean, great service and definitely great ramen!  It's our first time so we don't really know what we're ordering and definitely don't understand the menu...(a small description on the menu would be nice for first timers like us) but the waitress was very patient and nice explaining the menu to us - i was goin to give this place a 4 star because i cant understand the menu  but because of the nice waitress - that put the 5th star on the rating!  We ate every noodle and slurped our bowls clean!  We are pleasantly full and cannot wait to come back!  Wow Ramen Sora - I'm impressed!!!	5	Ramen Sora	4
Met with my cousin for lunch - and as always Kona has a good crowd - luv sitting at their patio area - great ambiance! Ordered couple sushi but the salmon salad is the best!  It's on the other side of town but it's sure worth the drive!	4	Kona Grill	3.5
Great local place. Love the simple dinning room atmosphere. Been here 'bout half dozen times. We've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here in the past. Always good food served fast.  Last night had the grilled butterfly rainbow trout with good sized loaded bake potato for $10.99. Added the all-u-can-eat salad bar for a reuced cost of $3.79. Realized I really didn't need the additional food. The entree was plenty. The trout was seasoned perfectly and grilled to perfection. The skin easily seperated from the tender fish meat. We really like to bring the kids because of the all-u-can-eat salad bar. It is always fresh with the usual stuff as well as pizza, pasta, tacos and wings. The latter is the main reason we go for the kids. Order just the salad bar, $6.99 for adult, $5.99 for Tweens and $4.99 for kids under 12. The only disappointment last evening was they had no wings and pizza when we arrived at 8:30pm. They may have had some out earlier but just didn't replenish??	3	Dessy B's Steak House	3.5
"Saw the billboard and decided to go in and try their pho.  My husband and I decided to split a medium bowl of pho, spring rolls and egg rolls and when we ordered it the lady which we think is the owner\/server gave us a look like we're crazy for sharing and started commenting about asian specially vietnamese DO NOT share pho and my husband who's white made a funny comment that we would like to share it because we're not asian!  Well, I'm filipino (100%) and so my husband made that comment to be funny and the server looked at me and said oh that's why I married my white husband because I'm not asian, I took this very offensive and then when we're done I asked her for a to go box and she again made a sarcastic comment abut bringing left over home!  

Very RUDE and TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Food is nothing special for me to come back!  I think the owner forgot that there are a lot of Vietnamese restaurant in the valley that she's competing with! 

Definitely a mistake and waste of money trying out this place.  I will have to just go back and stick with PHO KIM LONG!"	1	Pho 87	3.5
Very good burger joint - small size is all u need - can get messy!  However, u can maintain control by flipping your sandwich over with every bite. Sin city burger is the best with fried egg!  Yum!  We'll be coming back for more!	4	Smashburger	3.5
"Really sad to hear this place has closed it was my favorite place to eat when I was in Vegas. Actually one of the few reasons I even stopped in Vegas.
Great hot dogs the Chilean was my favorite and the waffle ice cream sandwiches were insanely good."	5	The Lunch Box	4.5
Pricey? Yes. However, given all realities worth it: location, taste, city etc.	4	Pink's Hot Dogs	3
Quality food, ambiance, moderate pricing . . . what more could you want?  The lemon-thyme salmon on orzo with peas and spinach was perfect, but the real find was the French onion soup with gruyere cheese.  OMG!  The portions are not skimpy either.  Didn't have room for desert (darn!), but I'll bet they're heavenly.  Oh, yes, it's across from Bellagio and you get to watch the water displays.  It was a wonderful date night!	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"I had my first visit to Hugo's Cellar this past weekend and throughly enjoyed it. My bf and I went with another couple who had previously dined here before on several occasions. As we entered, both Karen and I received a long stemmed red rose which I found hilarious for some reason.

My dirty martini was pretty damn good and so was the bacon wrapped filet mignon served on crab legs along with garlic mashed potatoes. Oh yes, I almost forgot, the table side salad. Our salad maker, I think was named Kenny? made a great salad and I had every damn topping short of onions that he offered. 

The only thing we missed out on was dessert but time was an issue. I'd definitely recommend going here for the ""old-school"" steak experience, especially with good friends who can appreciate the vibe..."	4	Hugo's Cellar	4.5
Love this place. Simple Ramen joint with a very basic menu, but always delicious and great service. Very reasonably priced and a small beautiful atmosphere. Definitely categorize it as a neighborhood gem.	5	Moko Ramen Bar	4
"I am a fan of the Hash House a Go Go in San Diego thanks to my friend Tomi who turned me on to it a few years back during the Comicon... 

This past weekend we were in Vegas for a friend's wedding and were pleasantly surprised to find out the owners opened location in the City of Sin. 

After taking a Zantac 75 pill, we headed over to the area to settle in and wait a good 45 minutes for a table for 2. Patience is key here friends; this location apparently has been on Man Vs Food (which I'm not familiar with) and some other food network shows. 

I had the Watermelon Kiwi Cooler which was beautiful to behold and deliciously refreshing to drink! 
I have a sensitive stomach so I decided to go easy and order the Blueberry Pecan Flapjacks with two bacon strips and eggs over easy. The pancake, as M put it, was bigger than his head! hehe... 

Damn was that pancake good although I only finished about 20% of it. M had the Basic or Original Breakfast which consisted of eggs, bacon or ham and potatoes. Still GIGANTIC for a mere $8.95 price tag. 

Our server was great if not a bit harried due to the overwhelming crowds due to a biker convention in town! I took my dear Flapjack to go and tore a few pieces off later to munch on before sending the remaining bits into the ye olde hotel room trashcan. 

I would recommend going at least ONCE to check this place out. The decor is fun, the servers wearing great outfits and the food spot on. Yes, it is crowded and a bit crazy inside but the experience is worth it to see GIANT food. 

This place also reminds me of a now defunct restaurant in New York called Royal Canadian Pancake House that I used to go to in the early early 90's... anyone remember or been there? 

Anyways, go check it out!"	4	Hash House A Go Go	4
"I've been going to Mr Lucky's for over 12 years now and I guess my favorite reason to keep going back is the people watching, not necessarily the fine dining. 

The food is better than Denny's but not necessarily gourmet. This place totally hits the spot if you arrive into town late, are staying at or near the Hard Rock (like Hyatt Place) and need a burger and fries STAT. I always ask for a front booth to enhance the experience.

So.. now to the food. We were there last Friday we ordered the following:  A BLD salad which was a caesar-salad like concoction served on toasted rounds (really good), a Turkey Burger with Avocado, Sirloin Burger and Red Velvet Cake. 

I would NOT recommend the turkey burger as it was not cooked very well and a bit mushier than it should've been. Needless to say, I did finish half since I was starving. The fries are really good.  

M said his burger was ""fine"" and ate half as well. The Red Velvet Cake was alright; not too sweet and not too dry. 

I guess I keep going back here for the atmosphere and the convenience of drunk food.... and the fact we always see crazy ass people while we're there!"	3	Mr. Lucky's 24-7	3.5
Went to new location on Sahara Blvd couldn't find location on Yelp. I understand it was their first day opening but I shouldn't have to wait 40 mins for some  pork chops and shrimp and grits. The sides were cold... I expected to devour this food and it was weak. The pork chops was hard to cut so they overcooked it. I live in Los Angeles and the M&Ms have not made it... The main waitress Vee was good and others just didn't know what to do because they seen we were curious why our food was taking so long... When I come back to Vegas I'll check and see if the 2nd location is still there because I highly believe it won't be. You gotta do better M&Ms staff I don't care if it was your first day this your second location. Business is business customers are most of the time right.	2	M&M Soul Food Cafe	4
The best Milk Tea I've ever stumbled upon. Can't get it anywhere else, way too good and way too addicting. Their Hokkaido tea is a must!	5	Brew Tea Bar	5
This sad casino\/hotel has shabby carpets, dirty walls, and comfortable beds.  It was pleasantly inexpensive, but some places on the strip are only $10 more.   I stayed here because it is where others wanted to stay and it was logistically convenient.  But even the others said it has gone downhill and they won't stay here again.  Neither will I.	1	Arizona Charlie's Decatur	2.5
Food was fine.  Service was terrible.  Toast came 10mins after the omelette.  Pancakes but no syrup.  Order was messed up.  Waiter\/owner were nice.  Tried to make up by discounting the food.  People are nice but they just don't know how to run a restaurant.  They're way understaffed.	2	The Daily Egg	3.5
"The buffet has such a beautiful ambiance. The food was ok but not sure if it was $45 dollars worth per person. There are a lot of complaints about food poisoning and terrible food I HIGHLY disagree.. hotels and buffets have standards they must follow to keep the customer save of food borne illness. People CHOSE to eat at a buffet a place where many people touch and sneeze or cough and then touch the same tong as the person before or after.. its a risk someone would take on their own. 
We were a party of 4 and our service was excellent with drink refills and keeping our table clear of plates and very friendly staff replenishing the pans or keeping their work station clean. 

Just a suggestion you will be waiting in line which is normal! Also obviously come hungry and look appropriate you are at the Wynn! lol not eating at the pool.. put some clothes on as if you were going to a casual dinning restaurant. They will not let you come in if you're not appropriately attired."	4	The Buffet	3.5
Visited with my husband July 28th for dinner with our friends. Let me tell you the cocktails to start while waiting in the lobby for our table were soo yummy, unique and rustic\/speakeasy feel. The service and the food was AMAZING we ordered just about everything to try and multiple drinks. The price of our tab surprisingly was not as high as we thought. Everything we tried was exceptional and very satisfying. I cant wait to visit vegas again and try more menu items.	5	Yardbird Southern Table & Bar	4.5
"I was very excited for my husband to try this place out because when I lived in Las Vegas and would party at Marquee this was the ""go to"" spot for a reasonable late night snack. The slices are perfect and always cooked well and service is very efficient on a busy night or a slower day. 
If you can't find seating inside there's plenty out by the pool table to relax and enjoy the atmosphere. Like always we enjoyed our visit here and its always fun introducing secret spots to people that have never been and not be disappointed."	5	Secret Pizza	4
Wonderful restaurant. More affordable for weekday lunch. Get in line before 2:45pm if you want to get dinner menu on lunch prices. Alaskan Crab leg are good, not too salty. Prime Rim is the best, unexpectedly tender. Pasta Station is wonderful, good portions too. Sushi and Chinese stations are mediocre. Sea Bass and other hot seafood dishes are delicious, served in tiny bite size for better sampling. Save your appetite for deserts too. Creme Brulee, Tiramisu are on the top of my list. Definitely going back for more.	5	The Buffet	3.5
First time eating there since a very good deal for rooms at South Point. Surprise to see prime rib dinner on Wednesday. Descent price per head, $17. Very good prime rib. Some other meats in Carving station (Short Rib especially) are good too. Not too much seafood selection, only easy peel shrimp is served. However, Green mussel are good too, butter and garlic, my favorite. Pasta station serves great live action and has a very friendly chef. Asian Station has Mongolian Grill (or Tapanyaki) but a bit oily and salty. Very basic dessert selection but very nice. Overall, very good food for the good price.	4	Garden Buffet	2.5
"When it comes to seafood buffet in Las Vegas, Village Seafood Buffet of Rio always wins the top spot. 

Price per person is $38.95. It is actually not bad for a place that offers sashimi, easy peel shrimps, hot and cold snow crab, fresh oysters, butter and garlic clams, steamed mussels, scallops to start. Great selections of hot plates such as lobster tails, shrimps, dungeon crabs, and stir-fried crab legs in Asian and Mediterranean style. Not to mention there are prime rib, toasted BBQ chicken, charbroiled Ma-hi Ma-hi, and stuffed crab shells. 

If anyone is going to crave in Village Seafood, please plan ahead and slow down. Try be only half full before you are done with entree. You really need to save some space for deserts. You will not miss the berries fruit tarts and other cakes made with dark chocolate, cheesecakes, cream puffs, low fat frozen desert in many flavors. 

Besides good food and excellence deserts, great customer service is also a plus. Very attentive server. Well deserve a $5.00 tip."	5	Village Seafood Buffet	3.5
Can't beat this AYCE for just $26.99 and you can skip the rice. Hot dishes are ok, must try soft shell crap, kama. They are willing to custom make your sushi, rolls, and side dishes. Actually Japenese sushi chefs here, i guess more authentic than sushi bar speaks Korean.	5	Hikari	4
I came to dine for the third time and still impressed by them. I have tried Bacchanal@Caesar Palace, but yet both places have their spotlights. presentation is always the best at Wicked. Portion sizes are amazing, which most of them are only bite sizes. That'll give you more room to try on something else. Prime rib and bone marrow are must-try items. their made-to-order Mac-N-Cheese has better variety now with more sauce options. Please leave rooms for deserts. sorbet and gelatos are to die for.	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
Came here for Father's Day a while back and expected it to be super crowded. With no reservation, the three people in my party waited about 45 min in the morning and luckily we were seated inside and escaped the deathly Las Vegas heat. The free banana nut muffin was a great little appetizer for our breakfast and the food was overall tasty. The highly reviewed corned beef hash was delicious but a little heavy\/salty for the morning	4	Egg & I	4.5
"If I can give this Taco Bell less than one star or negative stars I would.  A few different reasons made this place less than favorable. 
Reason number one. I had a large order one of the orders I specifically asked for a simple soft chicken taco. The lady taking the order repeated it several times back to me. When I got home she might wear today surprise they had given me. I am very very allergic to beef. This was strike one. 
When I return to make them aware of their mistake and simply have them fix it, it was a complete disaster. No one wanted to take responsibility for the order. And when they finally did it they were going to charge me extra. This was only strike two
At this point, as you could imagine I was furious with them. The lady shoved the bag at me. And stated ""here's your food""
I went inside and asked for the general managers number they toss me a receipt and then just walked away. No one acknowledged that I was even standing there. I asked for a manager and they smirked and laughed.
When the manager finally approached me he did not even introduce himself. He said that I just needed to come back tomorrow and talk to then.
This was strike two
When I asked for an apology everyone at the store looked at me as if I were speaking a foreign language. It was highly embarrassing. I had to raise my voice for them to even acknowledge that I was speaking. Every time I talked they cut me off and made a condescending remark. 
One of the cooks came from the back and started yelling and cursing at me also. We got into a screaming match in the store. Very unprofessional. Very out of character for me as well.
I would never return to this place. It was embarrassing and upsetting.
I will not be returning to this Taco Bell do you to the lack of professionalism and accuracy. This was not the first time that they had gotten the order wrong. Or spoke in a disrespectful way to a customer. So sad"	1	Taco Bell	2.5
Best flavors ever! Would eat the XLR pickle brined  chicken crisps!  Nashville hot if you can stand the heat.  A full pubs of white meat chicken, lightly battered with an awesome sauce.  The Moroccan ketchup is delish and so is the honey mustard.  Will chine back before we leave from our honeymoon! Glad we didn't wait for shake shack to open. And our waiter Bear was super nice too!	5	Tom's Urban	3.5

Ate here early in the morning. Just got in. The food was amazing but the service was so awful. Waited forever for drinks, asked for a few things they never arrived. Sad because the for was so yummy. Overcharged us for avocado in the tree hugger Benedict despite the fact it's supposed to come with avocado. Disappointed.	3	Tom's Urban	3.5
"Absolutely worth the money for a table... I was skeptical at first due to the prices of the bottles, I ended up saying screw it and bought a table some beer and a bottle of tequila. 

By far the best time I had in Vegas. I ended up blacking out and having my finance guy take me to the suite. 
- to the workers at ebc I'm sorry for falling asleep and apparently throwing up - 
But the staff here is super nice and made the night possible.

If you're debating on a table, do it!!!!!"	5	Encore Beach Club	4
"I came by around 11:30pm and had never tried this coffee place before and figured I'd give it a shot. So just keep in mind that they close the kitchen around 11pm. If you want food show up earlier than that.

My experience is based only on my interaction with an employee named Jose and simply the coffee he made for me.

I asked what they were known for and he said the caramel macchiato, I agreed. I wanted food but I had shown up too late, that's okay no problems there. But simply the way he talks to customers and the coffee he makes... Makes this review a 5 star. By far the best drink I've had in long time. He didn't make me feel bad for coming in late, or asking plenty of questions. Exactly what I look for in customer service, being that I work in that field.

If management sees this, give this man a promotion or something! He deserves it by his display of exceptional customer service. Thank you Jose, I'll be back for sure."	5	Espressamente illy	3.5
It's really beyond my expectation. The food here is welcome by my families from China and the service is pretty good!	4	Chin Chin	3.5
"Being as this was the only thing open around 2 in the morning and not feeling like getting back into our cars to drive somewhere to eat, we ended up at Raffles.

This diner is open 24 hours and is literally steps from the Bayside Buffet. The burger reminded me of Fat Burger because you can have an egg, chili, and bacon on your burger. Heart attack city, here I come!!

The waiter was decent, but the cooks sure got a lot of our burger orders (about 10 of us ate here) mixed up. 

Overall, an OK experience if you're staying at Mandalay, just a star above Denny's."	3	Raffles Cafe	3
I went here because I saw Rachel Rey say how good it was and what not. I'm sorry Rachel, but I don't agree that it was that great. It was decent, but for the price, I'd probably would've gone to Main Street Station for their buffet. It was basic buffet food, nothing seemed like it was fresh, more like, frozen items heated for the buffet. It was ok, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.	3	Firelight Buffet	3
"I came here with my gf at the time and our mutual friend. I was quiet pleased that it was quite decent for lunch at the time ($13.99\/person). 

I originally thought that no buffet could match up with Bellagio's. Boy, was I wrong. We all enjoyed this buffet a lot more than Bellagio's. 

There was a station with just salads that were getting freshly tossed by the servers. There was the usual fruit\/dessert station, the meats, pastas, and what not. 

I really liked the selection and went back about 3-4 times *oink. I think I may have found my new favorite when it comes to buffet and it's The Buffet @ The Wynn.

**Update** 

Brunch was $32 and change on a Saturday. Food was still as good, but a bit pricier as this is now a favorite amongst visitors to Las Vegas."	4	The Buffet	3.5
"Hype. It either is the maker or breaker of expectations. Unfortunately, this didn't live up to the hype. Almost everyone that eats late night or has a recommendation for other than regular eats on the strip, will utter this name.

The food wasn't bad, hell, it was good and flavorful like a lot of places in L.A. I would even dare to say a bit better. The service, well, I don't expect much, but it was satisfactory. The thing that makes no sense to me at all, the ordering system. Why is there 1 person and a separate line for a selection of meats? Why?! The lines would move so much quicker if they had people in the back cutting up said meats while 4-5 counter people take orders. Nope, they think having 1 guy handling each specific meat and 1 guy handling sides (grilled peppers, onions) is the way to go.

Well, it's not. It's a huge and annoying clusterf**k of people in line. It just makes no sense. Then, I wanted to buy an agua fresca, but no one told me how to get a cup. What? I ended up with a can of Coke. 

Meats and wares are good, but again, don't get the system of ordering and considering this is quite some ways away from the strip and the wait for food I can get in a good taqueria in L.A., I'll pass."	3	Tacos El Gordo	4.5
Honestly, like most outlets, the prices really aren't that big of a difference. I've found the only times it's cheaper at outlets is when the specific store was having a sale themselves. I know this outlet has been around for a while, but it still looks and feels new\/clean. The only problem, they have these fans that are supposed to cool you down with misters, but the dang mist always gets blown by the wind, meaning, no cooling down. Efff the heat. Effff it I say!	3	Las Vegas North Premium Outlets	4
"First and foremost, I would have to thank Cheska for taking us here and for Dave's incredible hospitality. 

After a night of drinks and karaoke (where one guy thought Linkin Park was some sort of Death Metal group the way he sang ""In The End""), we were convinced to come here by Cheska at the mere mention of ""tacos"". Oh, not just ordinary tacos mind you, but duck tacos. Yes, the aquatic fowl that is wildly enjoyed by this Yelper.

Lo and behold to our surprise, after hours, they have their own set of Happy Hour type pricing and serve tapas (which the duck tacos are a part of).

You'll have to excuse my lapse in memory, I had more than a couple of beers prior to getting here and then some when we did get here, heh. 

Sirloin Skewers, drizzled with a sweet teriyaki glaze - it was bit on the sweet side, and the beef being a little tough, but it was still good and wasn't overly sweet\/drowned out by the sauce

Mousakka - with nicey spiced lamb (which I normally don't care for) and melted cheese, but this was really good served with pita bread

Duck Tacos - shredded duck meat, in a small hard corn shell, served with chopped up veggies and a cilantro type sauce; it was good, a bit on the small side, but it wasn't something that would knock you off your feet, still one of my favorite things we got

I also believe we got other dishes, but again, my mind was too cloudy to remember. I do remember, that everything was decently good (I know I was drunk, but even I know what tastes good or not). I wouldn't mind coming back here in the wee hours of the night\/morning to meet up with Dave again. Good food, GREAT company (friends and Dave). I had no problem that when we did leave, the sun was coming up and I wouldn't mind doing that again."	4	Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill	4
"My friend Patrick was right for once. We normally don't have the same tastes when it comes to restaurants, but he was right on the money with his assessment on this one. He told me to walk in with an ""open mind"" though for him, it was, ""just OK"". Well, even with his encouragement, this place is another victim of the hype machine. I've seen numerous food shows covering the lines, the madness, and huge fanfare that covers Shake Shack's NYC location. 

So, you can only imagine how happy I was to find out that there was one in Las Vegas (not having to pay for a flight to NYC to try this out). 

To be fair, since I've had In N' Out and Five Guys, I ordered the following to compare:

Double Shack Burger; good, juicy patties, seasoned well, unfortunately someone had a heavy hand on the seasoning this night as the flavor kept going, as in, it turned out to be salty. Otherwise, it would've been a great burger, even though it is a bit on the small side (especially for the price tab)

Cheese fries; crinkle cut with a cheese sauce. My favorite part of the meal.

Fifty\/Fifty; which was just right, even though it might be a premixed drink, it was fine.

Overall, it is worth trying and a good product, but I don't know if I would frequently go here especially for the price point and overall value."	3	Shake Shack	4
"The last time I was at this buffet (while it was still ""The Aladdin""), I seriously wanted to choke someone out for making me pay for the filth they served me that they decided to call ""food"". Seriously, when I pay, I at the very least expect somewhat decent food.

Well, low and behold, after finally arriving in Las Vegas around 7:30 in the morning, I was famished and wanted to eat something! Anything! Being that my friend and I stayed at Planet Hollywood (what it is now), he did some gambling and actually got himself a voucher for a free buffet. So, why the heck not? Even though in the back of my mind, I did cringe a little when it was mentioned because of the horrible time I had last time. We were off!

The buffet was around $14 and change. I was surprised that they had a make-your-own-waffle station (you actually ask one of the cooks to put the batter into the waffle maker and wait), make-your-own-omelette station  (same premise, but you get a small array of veggies - onions, mushrooms, green peppers, ham, and cheese). I don't know what's happened to me, but after taking a nicely, freshly made waffle (with the ""PH"" Planet Hollywood logo on it), my omelette, roast beef with horseradish sauce, bacon, and sausage, I was done. No more! The thing I did notice, I actually enjoyed the food! If you're staying here and want a decent breakfast buffet, this is were I'd probably go to."	3	Spice Market Buffet	3
"Honestly, some people might like being treated like sh*t. Even if it's all in good fun, I'm not the kind of person that would PAY to be ""ribbed""\/joked at. 

I have my buddies who will do that for free, why go to a place where you just want to get your grub on and PAY for abuse?

It's funny, some of our servers jokes bordered on sexual harassment as one of the girls in our party didn't seem to like what he was saying. Again, some people may like it and think it's A-OK, but I wasn't feeling it.

The food was basic bar food, nothing really to write home about and it was a bit on the pricey side for what it was.

The only good thing about the place, if you order a ""Large"" margarita, expect it to be about 40 or so more ounces. My friend and I tried to finish this from here to state line and I ended up knocking out (because of traffic) and when I did wake up at State line, I was already hung over, lmao. 

So, I would probably come here just for that drink and eat elsewhere. I would rather have sh*t talked back and forth between my friends and I, instead of some server who basically gets to do what he\/she wants."	2	Dick's Last Resort	3
"My friends and I were in town for some serious eating and we found a Oyster Bar in one of the local casino's (name escapes me at the moment). 

We get there and see that the line is long, so we walk out and see Landry's across the street with, of course, ""OYSTERS"" written on the wall. So we thought, why not? It couldn't possibly be any busier than the small Oyster bar we attempted try.

The fist thing I noticed walking in, there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. I would say out of 20 tables, only 2 were occupied. That was a bad sign, but I didn't let it get to me.

We are seated and our orders are taken. Our drinks are promptly served, and our appetizers don't come out too much later.

I had a bowl of the Lobster Bisque. It was one of the best Lobster Bisque's I've ever had. It was nicely creamy, with the hint of the lobster, and just enough ""umph"" from the spices. So, great job on that Landry's.

That's where the happy ending comes to, well, an ending. We start the waiting game for our other dishes \/ main courses. One by one, they start to show up, but mind you, at least 20 mins between EACH dish passes before the next one gets delivered. By the end of about an hour and a half (after we did speak to our waitress, about what was taking so long - at which her only reply was, I don't know. 

Needless to say, the food (when we did get it) was decent, but the service destroys the entire experience. Of course by the duration of waiting for our dishes and actually getting them, the place did finally have more patrons. 

It was weird though, even though they showed up after us, a lot of them seemed to be served before us. 

Maybe next time, I'll just call for pickup?"	2	Landry's Seafood House	3
"The atmosphere of Peppermill is reminiscent of Downtown Las Vegas' ""hey day"". The motif of neon lights and wall to wall mirrors (looks like deconstructed disco balls) scream ""old school"".

You have plenty of choices when it comes to the fare. It's quite a cornucopia \/ mishmash of food. 

I had the pulled pork sandwich which was quite tasty, but it wasn't something that wowed me. Pork was tender and shredded, but was a basic sandwich.

Basically, I should have tried something that was more on the ""diner"" side (burgers, sandwiches) instead of something like a pulled pork sandwich that takes a lot of time to cook. Basically I learned not only from here, but from any place that serves ""BBQ"", if there's no pit and you don't smell it in the air, don't order ""BBQ"".  

In conclusion, Peppermill is more for nostalgia of earlier Vegas with Denny's type food. It's just a smidge above Denny's, but not by much."	3	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
Was okay. Didn't taste that fresh. Very nice staff and service. The Crawfish was so small and not even worth trying to eat because it was so skinny and dried up. I however liked their sweet potato fries. My brother and boyfriend got really sick eating their mussels and shrimp. They stayed in our hotel room the whole night and was having food poison symptoms. 3 days later they are still feeling the wrath and haven't fully recovered. I feel guilty rating this place so low but if your family members can barely walk due to overwiping and nausea, you would feel inclined to do so too.	1	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
"Underwhelming food and experience. We were a party of three and dined there last night. Expectations were high given the name behind this spot and the usually high standards of the Venetian. The Beet salad appetizer started great - simple, refreshing and excellent flavors. However main courses were mediocre at best. Sirloin steak was dry, came with Arugula and about as much balsamic as fits on the tip of your finger. Absolutely no taste to this dish. My friend's Quail was over cooked and overall plate was just poorly combined. Our other companions Linguine was deemed very good. The biscotti plate and Americano coffee were the best part of the meal.

Service was well below what we are used to from the Venetian businesses. Waiter was friendly enough but didn't hide the fact that he didn't give a shit about anything. Pinot Grigio was served after the appetizers arrived and his reaching over our plates to pick up a thing or two through out the meal made me want to slap his wrist.

Overall I feel this place is poorly managed and overblown. Won't be back."	2	B&B Ristorante	3.5
For incredible Chinese seafood dishes SK is the place. A friend referred us here who has been going there for years, and it doesn't disappoint. The food is expertly prepared and the setting is very cozy and open. The noodle dishes are out of this world, and the seafood dishes are worth the venture. Good service and a fun experience	5	SK Seafood Restaurant 勝記	4
Absolutely my favorite steakhouse off the Las Vegas Strip. Food is excellent. Service impeccable always and staff are well trained and incredibly hospitable. Spacious atmosphere.  Try the Tomohawks that are off menu, you'll never go vegetarian! Also, terrace seating is the way to go when it's not summer.	5	Echo & Rig	4.5
Everything you would expect from a high end steakhouse at the Wynn with "his" name on it! After several visits over the years I can honestly say this is the one steakhouse in Vegas that delivers perfection every time. Food is just outstanding, wine selection excellent, service remarkable and the little extra touches make the experience special. One of my favorite places in the country.	5	SW Steakhouse	4
The perfect Jewish New York deli! The counter has everything you miss from back in the neighborhood and it's all homemade. The diner is great for an on the go meal. Service is friendly and fast. Suggest the chicken liver pate and the bagels and locks.	5	The Bagel Cafe	4
An amazing atmosphere and set up with a good menu, located right downtown. Triple George Grill has a great vibe and service is always fantastic. Food is good, stops short of being exceptional - more big chain presentation and flavor than labor of love - but you won't be disappointed. Cocktails and deserts are the best thing here...	3	Triple George Grill	4
Wow, what a great place. Atmosphere is very cozy and stylish, modern yet comfortable. The food was amazing, you have to try the house specials. Service was excellent and friendly. Definitely will be back!	5	Le Pho Vietnamese Kitchen	4
A Charlie Palmer signature spot when in Vegas. Aureole has a tasting menu that is worth the experience. Aureole's menu speaks for itself but it's the multi-million dollar wine cellar that is the prize of Aureole. Located conveniently in the Mandalay Bay	5	Aureole	3.5
The food in this little behind the scenes cafe is off the charts. The kebabs are the best in Vegas, and the rice dishes are home-made. This is not where you go for atmosphere or romantic settings, this is where you go to eat! Try the fesanjoon, it's ridiculous	5	Zaytoon Restaurant	4.5
Excellent atmosphere and service. Food is mediocre. You want to love this place because of its old school Italian setting, but the food is really underwhelming. If you are not picky about your pasta then this is a place to try.	3	Capo's Italian Cuisine	4
My favorite sushi place on the West side of town. It's laid back, excellent service, and a great menu. Every meal we have had there has been superb. The rolls are as you would expect - works of art that fill you up. Great sake selection too...	5	Sushi Fever	4
Live Lola's Louisiana Kitchen. Great place for a lunch date with amazing Louisiana dishes on the menu. The baked oysters are magnificent, and the gumbo truly done right. Love the atmosphere of the place too.	4	Lola's A Louisana Kitchen	4
"Awesome location and atmosphere at Urban Turban. Service was most excellent and the ambiance at the restaurant perfect for a night out. 

The best for last - the food is iconic. Really well put together menu selection and the chef in the bam delivers quality fresh Indian food as opposed to the oily dishes most places serve. 

Highly recommend Urban Turban for their traditional yet modern Indian cuisine."	4	Urban Turban	4
Definitely a different type of burger joint! Fusion between Japanese cuisine and burgers makes for a very interesting combination and then even more interesting selection on the menu. If you're looking for traditional burger I'd go somewhere else, this place has gourmet burgers you would've never dreamt of. We had a great meal, two very unique burger selections left your mouth drooling. The best thing about the food is combining it with a nice cold Japanese beer. The atmosphere is pretty cool too.	5	Bachi Burger	4
"The overall experience at the Golden Steer Steakhouse is five star. This place takes you back in time to when Frank, Dean and the boys used to come in and order a few cocktails before their meal. If you haven't been here you are missing a part of Vegas history. 

The decor is fantastic - old leather booths, table cloth service, an absolutely great bar. Complete steakhouse menu with a few gems - ribeye is the way to go. Only wish we could still light up a cigar at the end of the meal!"	5	Golden Steer Steakhouse	4
This is a favorite place to go for the atmosphere and the views. Food is good but 3 star compared to other options in this great town. On the plus side it's very affordable. The experience of dining at Binion's Steakhouse is worth going. Just don't expect 5 star steaks...	3	Top of Binion's Steakhouse	4
Classic diner experience with friendly staff. Wide menu choices, breakfast is always best in my opinion. But their home baked pies are the real secret.	4	Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant	3.5
Still a favorite amongst Vegas locals, Del Frisco's is always a great place to dine. Great bar to start the evening off with a cocktail. The seafood platter is just beautiful. Steaks and sides are excellent. Service level has really dropped over the years - most of the waiters and bus boys are not trained properly so don't expect 5 star service. The patio is a favorite place to end the night with a cigar.	5	Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House	4.5
The food is exquisite. The wine list is excellent. Service is great and they love locals if you tell them your not from out of town. Fantastic experience every time we go.	5	Carnevino	3.5
Vegas doesn't have the coffee shop culture other cities seem to be embracing but Sambalatte is the exception in town. Full on coffee house with lots of goodies in the quintessential coffee house setting. Definitely a place to see and be seen when in the Boca Park area...	5	Sambalatte Torrefazione	4
If you want the closest thing to authentic French pastries and light fare, it doesn't get better than Bonjour Bakery. The Chef\/Owner is one of the best French chefs in Vegas. He is sticking to his guns on authenticity of his menu as opposed to adapting for American preferences. Try the baguette sandwiches, they are to die for.	5	Bonjour Bakery & Deli	4
First time in this gem of a local diner. Had a wonderful experience, service was excellent and staff very friendly and appreciative. Food was exactly what you'd expect from an old school diner. The corn beef hash is as good as what you'd find in the South. Their home made preserves are phenomenal. We ordered one pancake to see what they can do on the griddle - their batter needs a little work compared to other local pancake houses. Everything else was nothing short of perfect. Will make this our regular breakfast place.	5	Lou's Diner	4.5
"I had heard about Hedary's for years from friends who recommended it for great Lebanese food. We finally went for a meal 4 months ago and have been back 7 times since. This is the quintessential family run restaurant that happens to make the best Lebanese food in Vegas.

The menu is excellent and we have been exploring every time we go back. The fish is absolutely fantastic as is all the various meat we have had. The appetizers are everything you want from a fresh Mediterranean restaurant - hummus with jalapeño is great. 

End the night with a Lebanese coffee - it's off the charts!"	5	Hedary's Mediterranean Restaurant	4.5
A must visit when in Vegas. Not just because of the views or the rotating restaurant that gives you the panoramic views of the valley, but the food is actually magnificent. The Chef and his team have done a remarkable job delivering quality and flavor for great value. You won't be disappointed.	4	Top of the World	4
Simple, good and conveniently located. Food here is always good. Recommend giving it a try when looking for great Asian comfort food. Prefer take out than eat in given the feel of the place is more coffee shop than restaurant.	3	Jackie Bee Boba Express	3.5
One of Vegas' old off Strip eateries that happens to specialize in French cuisine. The food was fantastic and the old setting the restaurant is in has its charms. The only disappointment was the lack of a good wine menu which is not very French...	4	Pamplemousse Le Restaurant	4
"Hands down the best pizza in Las Vegas. This place is a classic dive bar and pizza joint. Food is fantastic, the pizza is off the charts. You can eat on site or take out. And you can smoke at the bar while you eat which is a rarity these days.

As far as the pizza goes...try the Guinea, it's phenomenal!"	5	Naked City Pizza Shop	4
Always top notch and fun. The food is outstanding and the staff friendly. The main reason to come here is to eat! The meats are excellent and keep coming. Salad bar is good, but the meat is the draw. Definitely a fun night out for a group of carnivores. The flan for desert is worth keeping some room for.	4	Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse	4.5
Very few Lebanese choices in Las Vegas, Amena bakery and deli is the place to go! The homemade food is phenomenal. The kibbe is as good as I've had anywhere, and food is always fresh and well prepared. Service can be a little slow, but I put that down to the effort and care that goes into preparing each dish.	5	Amena Bakery & Deli	4.5
"The feel of the place is what's unique at Le Thai. They've taken an unusual space right downtown and made it their own. You can imagine yourself in the back alleys of Bangkok when sitting at one of their benches eating the freshly made pad Thai. Le Thai is THE downtown eatery if you want an Asian experience...

The food stands up for itself. We usually order several dishes to share and have plenty left over. They have some great cocktails too for a little preDinner drink. 

All in all this place is fantastic."	5	Le Thai	4
"Tucked away in a strip mall where you least expect an authentic French bakery to be, its nice to see a true Parisian experience here in Vegas. The baked bread is the best you'll find in town. The croissants and pastries are exactly the right look and taste. And their quiche Florentine is the bomb. We'll be back regularly. Nice atmosphere, very laid back. And the coffee is actually good.

Tips: 
- The Pistacchio bread is ridiculous!!!
- Pate sandwich is excellent, ask them to butter the bread for perfection"	5	Delices Gourmands French Bakery	4.5
Chada offers a very unique Thai experience. This is not your typical fast Thai experience. Chada is a date night location with amazing service, presentation and Thai flavors on its menu. The small setting makes it very popular with local Vegas foodies so book a table or expect a wait.	5	Chada Thai & Wine	4.5
"A very unique coffee shop meets breakfast place experience right in the downtown area. Hands down the best coffee you will find in Las Vegas. The baristas are serious about their coffees and the menu has a variety of selections that looks nothing like your typical latte\/cappuccino\/americano menu. Their ice coffee concoctions are also incredible for the hot summers...

The food is also amazing. A fusion of Hawaiian dishes, you'll find a variety of hot selections as well as excellent bakery choices - the blueberry scones are ridiculous. One tip: anything with egg will come with traditional Hawaiian undercooked eggs so if you don't like that tell them upfront your eggs need to be cooked all the way through. 

Final comment on Public Us...the hipster space and atmosphere is refreshingly welcome here in the desert. You'll enjoy this place as we did! 5-Star!"	5	PublicUs	4.5
Great place to grab a margarita and Mexican food with a view on poolside at the Hard Rock hotel. Food is great, drinks are better.	4	Pink Taco	3.5
A gem of a local restaurant! You are always well received at Ferraro's! Menu is off the charts and the cocktails are excellent. Love the patio where you can light up a cigar after a great meal!	5	Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar	4
The food at Hummus is off the charts! This kosher hole in the wall makes the best falafel, hummus and kosher burgers in town. Everything is prepared fresh and with care. Worth the premium price you pay.	5	Hummus Vegas & Grill	4.5
Food is good old Italian grub. Ordered a variety of stuff from their menu and they were all great. The messy hot subs are just outstanding - the sausage and peppers and the Philly cheese steak are winners. The pasta is also excellent - spaghetti and meatballs and baked ziti are . Also love the garlic knots. Next time we'll try the pizza!	4	Frankie's Pizza	4.5
One of the best Thai restaurants in all the Las Vegas Valley. The quality and freshness of their food, as well as the unique tastes they bring out of traditional dishes like Panang chicken or Pad Thai is as good as I've seen anywhere around the world. Friendly staff, good service when dining in, great take out service as well. Highly recommend trying this gem of a spot.	5	Weera Thai Restaurant	4
For years the food at India Oven has been consistently excellent. In a city of restaurants I find there is a lack of good Indian options, but India Oven never disappoints. The Vindaloo is solid if you like spicy hot. Their biryani is a favorite. Also love the naan. If the quality of food is important to you, this is a great option.	4	India Oven	3.5
A favorite breakfast spot on the West side of town. Food is really good and selection caters to healthy and happy. Always have tables available and staff are friendly. Place is big and spacey. Wish they would up their coffee game as that's the only thing not up to par!	4	Biscuits Cafe	3.5
If they had a location easier to access than on the Strip, I'd be there 4 times a week. Pizza by the slice like you haven't seen. Try the Sicilian, it's just perfect.	5	Secret Pizza	4
"A unique atmosphere stemming from a unique location overlooking Mccarran's runway where the right table gives you a view of planes landing and taking off. Excellent setting for a date night, entertaining guests or business groups. 

And the food is nothing short of phenomenal. The Oslo Bucco is ridiculous and the seafood always good. The wine selection is also excellent. This is a gem of a restaurant conveniently located near the strip."	5	Panevino Italian Grille	4
The Persian food at Habib's is always on point. Great menu, flexible to make things not on the menu if you give them a day or two heads up. Kabobs are always great. Needs improvement on service as they are unusually understaffed and slow. But the wait is worth the food.	4	Habib's Persian Cuisine	3.5
The food is absolutely first rate at Chengdu Taste. Authentic Chinese dishes that you won't recognize off their menu. We decided to order a dozen different dishes to try between 8 of us. One dish after another is an amazing flavor bomb. Service was excellent and the staff enjoys helping us pick out dishes and taste them. This is so authentic a spot we were the only non-Asians in there both times. 5 star all around.	5	Chengdu Taste	4
Food is excellent, service is great, but the place lacks the vibe you expect from a Tommy Bahama restaurant. We've been there three times in the last year and it always seems to be the same chain restaurant experience. Again, food is great, service friendly, just lacks ambiance. The fact they won't let you smoke a cigar on the outdoor patio also irritates...	3	Tommy Bahama Restaurant | Bar | Store - Las Vegas	4
Food is very good, service and atmosphere really poor. Best to get take out. The rice and beef kabob was really off the charts.	3	Pro Kabob Persian Restaurant	4.5
"This is the best Italian food in Vegas, period. True to it's ""Deli"" name, you get the feeling you are in an old New York neighborhood when walking into this unassuming shop on West Sahara Ave. The deli counter will have you perusing for 10 minutes and the friendly staff are welcoming. The little wine shop inside the deli has some amazing gems, so spend another 10 minutes browsing there. 

Once you sit down at a table to look at the menu you are fully ready for the fresh bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar they bring you promptly.

The menu is full of hidden marvels. Everything is great and if you are in a group I suggest going family style - everyone order something and share as portions are generous and you'll want to try everything. 

My personal favorites are the homemade pizza as appetizer and the sausage ragu fettuccine. The linguine and clams is another excellent choice. Is you are on the go then just gran the Chicken Parme sandwich."	5	Roma Deli II and Wine Shop	4
A favorite lunch place when hitting the Forum Shoppes at Caesar's. It's everything you'd expect from Wolfgang Puck and his Spago chain. Service is fantastic and friendly, seating very comfortable. Their terrace is the prime spot to sit. Fettuccini, pizza and bruschetta are the choices to go with on the menu. Consistently been good over the past 10 years since we started going here.	5	Spago by Wolfgang Puck	4
Hands down the best Persian food in Vegas. Family run atmosphere and friendly service. Quality of food is excellent and they really take care of you on portions. Eat in or take out, both options are excellent. Really glad I discovered this place.	5	Aria Mediterranean Restaurant	4.5
Who knew the best Mexican food in town is in the same building as Sapphires?? I had a large group of New York bankers in town for a few nights so we went for a late meal at El Dorado Cantina before heading next door. The first thing that strikes you is the excellent service. The prepared at your table guacamole is the best you'll have in Vegas. The food is quality, fresh and full of flavor. The prices are anything but typical Mexican food prices, but it's worth every penny.	5	El Dorado Cantina	4
Food is the best west of the Mississippi. Expect long waits and crowded environment but it's worth it	5	Lotus of Siam	4
Overrated, poor service, overpriced and a zoo atmosphere. That was our experience when we brought out of town friends to Sushisamba for a dinner for four. Food was very good as you'd expect, but the experience makes this place a "keep off" location. I took the waiter aside to plead with him as a local to treat my out of town guests with more care and attention - he didn't bring one of the four drinks we ordered, forgot 2 of the appetizers we ordered, and didn't bring the bottled water we ordered twice...high expectations quickly became a disappointing experience. Will never return to what is nothing more than a tourist trap...	1	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
Really loved the vibe at Mary's Hash House. The food is classic home-cooked diner from the Midwest or East Coast, and you will love it. But the location needs work to make it feel less "pop-up" store. Service was friendly and good, definitely worth giving it a try.	4	Mary's Hash House	4
"If you're looking for all things French you won't be disappointed at La Belle Terre. Authenticity is the main thing coming out of their kitchen. From the pastries to the sandwiches, the Chef brings that little piece of Paris you want. 

Where they could improve is the quality of their coffee and the long\/slow lines at the counter. The coffee is too big chain for a place that's supposed to be Paris Cafe. As for the slow line, it's the main reason we don't come back weekly...

All in all we love this place, just needs a little fine tuning"	4	La Belle Terre Bread French Bakery Café	4
Always greeted and treated well at Paymons on Sahara. Other than the food being excellent, what I love about this place is the wide variety of Mediterranean cuisine on the menu. There is something for everyone. If you want a Greek salad and your date prefers pasta, no problem. If you're looking for a kebab, but your date wants a good curry, they got you. Just a great place to go out for a meal when you're not sure what you want.	5	Paymons Mediterranean Cafe & Hookah Lounge	3.5
One of my favorite off Strip restaurants in Vegas. Been going here since they opened. Everything about Vintner Grill is tasteful. The ambiance is just excellent especially given this place is located in an office building. The menu is something of a cross between great American cuisine and European fare. Suggest starting the table out with a cheese and cold cuts plate. Their selection is excellent given Vegas struggles to supply great cheeses IMHO. As for the rest of the menu expect nothing short of haute cuisine quality, flavors and experience.	5	Vintner Grill	4
Our room was outdated at least 20 years. All the carpets throughout the halls were terribly stained. Our tv did not work, nor did our phone. Could not call for room service. Had to call out to some nasty Italian food place. Couldn't even sign in to their promised wifi. No one seemed to care!!! Oh yea, plus a resort fee of $15.00 per day! And tax on top of that!!!???!!!  This place is far from a resort. The pool needs to be dug up and resized to accommodate the amount of people and hotel size ratio! I had really looked forward to this little get away, kick back and get a tan. So much for that, very non-appealing....no space! This place is a dive!!!	1	Riviera Hotel & Casino	2.5
Sat in bar area waiting for a "10" minute wait to be seated. After more than 20 minutes decided to just eat at bar. Ordered a drink & bruschetta. Server brought bruschetta with large slices of barely toasted bread. In Cali it comes with the small toasted ciabatta bread. Asked server to change bread. A server supervisor in all blue came to assure they would bring the new bread, nice lady!  When the bread came it was pure white, barely toasted. I sent it back. Our server came to table & said had to send it back AGAIN, it was STILL not done right!  Finally, it came. So I decide to have another drink (grey goose & peach schnapps).  Well, they ran out of peach schnapps & the bar tender tried to trick me with peach brandy.......come on now!!!  I sent it back!  So here comes the restaurant manager to tell me they ran out, what would I like on the house & remove charge from other drink.  She sent bar tender to me to ask what i would like. Nice guy!  Now that's the way to make amends with the customer!  Thank you manager @ supervisor in blue. Sorry, didn't get ur names. Server we had, no thank you.	3	Olive Garden Italian Restaurant	3.5
What a great place to get your smoothies, paninis, and acai bowls! Smooth eats has the best prices you will find around and they use all the best quality ingredients in your product and it really shows in the flavor it's awesome! Not to mention the staff of smooth eats are the nicest and friendliest people I've encountered in any eating establishment thus far. This is certainly one of my go to spots from now on and I will be here on a regular basis from here on out! Amazing place and gets two thumbs way up	5	Smooth Eats	5
Quick, amazing quality and wonderfully priced. My co-workers and I always pick up from here for lunch.	5	Jjanga Japanese Restaurant	4
I had the Thai nachos, steak and shrimp tacos, and the spicy pina margarita. The food was delicious and margarita was spot on. All served up by Dean! Great customer service! Definitely coming back the next time I'm in Vegas.	5	Nacho Daddy	4

"This place needs to shutdown and start all over. If you walk the strip you can find ""deals"" to get there and get in. The girls are free admission but the guys not so much. The drink minimum is where they get you. The drink coupons we received must have only covered water. Every ""free"" drink we ordered cost us extra, and they weren't fancy top shelf drinks at all. So expect to pay extra for anything other than water. 
Took the girls upstairs to the guys where these ""clowns"" informed us that they didn't appreciate the guys being up here with the ladies. (Probably because we were better looking. Or it was due to the laughter from their lack of dancing ability) So after a good laugh from the clown show, we left the ladies up there to try and salvage a good time in the place. Less than a half hour later the gals were so disappointed in upstairs they came down and sat with us. My wife said she tried really hard to spend money up there but couldn't understand the men from their accents or they were just not ""Vegas stripper"" caliber. 
The ladies were even more of a joke. If you like high pressure sales, then you'll have fun. No dancing ability at all period. Would not call them ""hot Vegas strippers"". Very below average girls. Every girl said the same thing, so their sales lines are probably posted in the dressing room. I can't even review the dancing on the stage, there was none. Topless I don't care I'm here please gimme a dollar walk around the stage is all it was. We especially loved the girl that yawned on stage. 
I don't know where to go for a good strip club out there, but this isn't it. Couldn't afford to get burned by another one. 
Oh and that ""deal"" limo ride ya got getting there, good luck getting it back.
Only reason they got a one, because I couldn't give them a zero. Beware of the trap people!!!"	1	OG Gentlemen's Club	3
"$1 sliders, $1 wings great place for happy hour. Between 3pm-6pm Mon-Friday they have great happy hour on food. Friday and Sauturday nights they have dueling pianos. It was very convenient since I was staying at Monte Carlo.

Will come again."	5	The Pub at Monte Carlo	3
"Canes is great place for a fast food joint. We cam here once about 2 years ago and decided to go their again before our road trip back home.

Very satisfied. Great customer service and food.

I recommend the chicken strip sandwich Combo only $6
A little cheaper then Chik-Fil-A.
I was told that their is lots of them in the South, just a fact.

i will return again when I am in town."	5	Raising Cane's	4
"Its located on the same property of Caesars Palace out in front. 
Went here during lunch time wanting to have a burger or hot dog, but they were only offering a brunch menu and a lot of it consist of  breakfast food. I didnt really mind but it does suck that brunch isnt over till 2pm. 
So if your looking to have a burger or foot long hot dog, go after 2pm when the menu changes.
Service was great,very clean place.
I had the quesadilla that comes with eggs,bacon,potatoe, and cheese.
We also had a chicken sandwich,comes with chicken,chips(inside),tomatoe,lettuce and comes with a side of fries of your choice.
Great food!
Will return again."	4	Serendipity 3	3
"Went here to eat before hitting the club and cant say I have ever had better egg plant pizza. Didn't sound to good but after taking that first bite, WOW!!!!

The bruschetta was very very good and so was the free bread.

The service wasn't so great. Our server had a big party so he never checked up on us. Which I understand if you get a big party but dont forget about your other tables. 

The bussers were more helpful. Always asked if we were doing ok and serving us water.

Other than That it was really good for.

Definitely will return again!"	4	Cucina by Wolfgang Puck	4
**Open Bar Review Only** 1\/1\/17 2AM. We were walking around New Year's Day on the strip when two guys from Carlos and Charlie waived us down and told us to check out the open bar night to open up the New Years. It was $25 per person and you had 1hr open bar. So we walked over to the Carlos and Charlie and the music was going but we couldn't see inside. Screw it we decided to go in. As you walk in they hand you a plastic Dixie cup and tell you to hold on to it or there will be a fee for a new cup.  That was weird as it was. We walk in and there is about 30 people just standing around listening to the DJ. The dance floor was all wet from people spilling there drinks on it. The reason why I gave it one star and wish I could've gave it negative stars was because of what they were serving behind the bar. All the bottles behind the bar were bottom shelf generic imitation bottles. The worst of the worst. All the bottles on the back shelf were not being served. They weren't part the open bar. They had a few beers on tap. I asked for IPA and they told me NO. I asked for Bud Light and they said No. So I told him to give me whatever was included in the open bar. Disgrace of bartender come back with Natural Ice. Within that one hour of being there we decided we had enough. Dump of a place could keep the money, they needed it. About to walk out when security stops everyone who's leaving because a female slipped and busted her face open. Since there was blood everywhere we had to wait till they cleaned it up to exit. Place is a dump don't go here.	1	Carlos'n Charlie's	2
"We stopped in to Hussong's for a quick bite to eat before heading over to New York New York to see Zumanity. We were seated quickly, and had chips, salsa (two kinds, a red and a green), and water brought to our table right away, which was nice.

The food, honestly, was alright, but the lobster tacos were what really drew us in, and they were a disappointment. The shells were deep fried, which really overpowered any flavor of lobster...or anything else in the taco. I ended up scraping everything out of the shell, and that was marginally better, but still. Sad. The steak quesadilla, on the other hand, was really good - it was served ""open face"" instead of folded over like a normal quesadilla, so it looked more like a pizza, but hey, whatever. It was tasty. I liked that the sour cream was drizzled over the quesadilla instead of served on the side, and even though the quesadilla apparently no longer comes with guacamole, our server brought me a side order of guac anyway with no additional charge.

The salsas were interesting - the texture of the red one reminded me of marinara sauce, but it was actually really tasty and slightly spicy. I tried the green salsa, which was the one my husband preferred, but it didn't have the same heat as the red, so I ignored it after the first couple of bites.

Our drinks (a Mexican mojito and a Mango Margarita) were really good - a little bit pricey, but overall tasty and a decent deal for Vegas. Service was fast, if not overly friendly, and the Mariachi band was cool. They played everything from Pink Floyd to the traditional Mariachi music, and we enjoyed listening to them. We also enjoyed looking at all of the decor around the restaurant, as there was a LOT to look at. I'm regretting we didn't get a photo with the cardboard cutout Dos Equis guy!

Overall, I probably wouldn't be back in, as there are PLENTY of places in Vegas to eat, but it was still an alright meal."	3	Hussong's Cantina Las Vegas	3.5
"5 stars, because this is the place where my husband and I had our first date, back in 2005. So, how could it NOT get 5 stars! 

Every time we're in Vegas, we always make sure to stop by Nine Fine Irishmen at least once, for old time's sake. And it's always consistently good. In fact, it's always just the same as we've left it - same house band, same menu, same drink prices. And to be honest, that's not a bad thing. We always know that we're going to enjoy ourselves, and relive fun moments from our past. 

Drinks are somewhat pricey; it's Vegas. They do often measure their pours, though, which is annoying. The food is alright, but we don't come here to eat - we come to drink, soak up the atmosphere, and listen to the band. Since the band takes requests, one of our favorite activities is to play ""stump the band"" and request all of the obscure Irish songs we can think of. It's fun, though, when they actually know one! 

The bartenders aren't really outgoing, but they do keep everyone well hydrated. The atmosphere isn't really like what you'd find in a pub IN Ireland (it's a little too upscale for that), but Nine Fine Irishmen still does a good job of creating a fun, pub atmosphere, and is a good change from the standard Vegas craziness. You definitely don't feel like you're in Las Vegas...until you step out the door! I prefer to sit at the bar downstairs, but the upstairs area is nice as well, especially if you're having a meal. Downstairs can get a bit rowdy and loud as the evening goes on. 

I do have to admit that there's another pub in Vegas that has recently stolen my heart, but Nine Fine Irishmen will always be special to me, and I know each time we visit will be as good as the last. I'm already looking forward to the next time we stop in."	5	Nine Fine Irishmen	4
"Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I'm no stranger to an Irish pub. In fact, I'm a regular pub snob, as my husband is 100% born and raised in Ireland, and I've spent a good amount of my time in pubs. Some good, some bad, some mediocre. And I know it's a chain, but I LOVE this Ri Ra.

After a stressful week spent in meetings, the minute I got to Vegas all I wanted to do was unwind. My coworker knows I love a good pub, and was familiar with Ri Ra, so she suggested we go get a drink. I could still hug her for that! When I stepped in, Ri Ra felt like home. Irish staff and bartenders, dim lighting, lots of dark wood, and an all around great atmosphere. There's even a statue of St. Patrick holding a pint! Love it. (Oh, and this pub is HUGE, btw - if you don't like the area you're sitting in, go exploring into another room, and you're bound to find a space that makes you happy.)

So, we sat at the bar, I knocked back a couple of Jameson & Diet Cokes (not too overly expensive for Vegas, either), and we shared the curry chips, which were excellent. A huge portion (for a good price), and I don't know what they did with the curry, but I loved it, and I'm not normally a fan of curry. As my husband was due to arrive into Vegas later that night, I immediately made plans to bring him back in for drinks and dinner.

Flash forward a few hours, and he and I are sitting in the snug, dining on some awesome food (get the salmon...mmmm.) and listening to a decent ""Irish"" band. (They didn't just play trad Irish, but also threw a bit of everything in, from classic rock and beyond). We moved to the bar after dinner, and  my husband strikes up a conversation with the bartender, who is (of course!) from my husband's home town. 

This experience pretty much laid the foundation for our weekend in Vegas, as I think we managed to come back to Ri Ra at least 3 more times over the weekend, and each time was a lot of fun - full or empty, music or no music. 

I already can't wait for my next trip back to Vegas in October, as I'll definitely be a repeat customer at Ri Ra. Just save me a seat at the bar, and have a menu and a Jameson ready for me."	5	Rí Rá Irish Pub	4
"I'm a little bit crazy, in that I generally don't eat at buffets...unless I'm in Las Vegas. Yeah, I know. Weird.

ANYWAY, there always seemed to be a really long line for Le Village, so we avoided it in the past. However, I was recently in Vegas for a work event, and was gifted with Diamond status for the Harrah's ""family"" of hotels and casinos, so I was able to use my VIP status to bypass the line, go through the fancy area, and get seated right away. YAY!

The ambiance of the Le Village buffet gets 4 stars. They really try to make you feel like you're in a little courtyard somewhere in France, which is cool with me. Especially when I was coming down from a stressful weekend and just wanted to relax, eat, and drink. I didn't feel like I was in Vegas, which totally worked for me. Our server was really nice, and had iced teas and mimosas (YAY, mimosas!!) on the table right away, and our mimosa glasses really didn't ever get empty. I'm a big fan of free unlimited mimosas, so I was a pretty happy girl from that standpoint.

Now, the food. Honestly, from the ever-present line and a lot of the reviews, I was expecting to be wowed. And I really wasn't. I mean, the food was good, and this buffet is definitely better than some, but there wasn't anything terribly French. Or many things that I couldn't get at any other buffet, really. But there were some pretty good dishes that I did break my one plate rule for and went back for seconds: bacon and brie pasta, spicy mussels, garlic mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, lamb tips, shrimp (oh, shrimp. How I love you.), and the antipasti plate. The creme brulee for dessert was nice, but nothing to swoon over. The rest of the desserts didn't do it for me, which was probably good, after the second plate of the things I mentioned above!

The price was comparable to other Vegas buffets, and for the quality of the food, a better deal than at some of the other hotels. All in all, was it good? Yep. Was it my favorite Las Vegas buffet? Nope. Would I be back again? Yes, but I wouldn't wait for ages in a line. It's a solid option, though, and like I said...the ambiance is worth it, especially if you want to feel like you're not in Vegas for awhile."	3	Le Village Buffet	3
"After a late night of dancing at XS we came here to sober up.

Had 3 al pastor tacos and they were bomb!!  

They have different lines for the different meats, which is annoying, since I originally wanted 1 chorizo and 3 al pastor, but other than that, the food is delish and cheap!

5 stars from me!"	5	Tacos El Gordo	4
While in Vegas over this past weekend we visited this bar. Let me say they have amazing food here! Buy one get one free great mixed drinks! The fries they have I forgot what they were called but omgodness!!!! This place is also a club at night and plays great music a lot of hip hop and top 40's. They also have beer pong lol Super fun place with great food!	4	PBR Rock Bar & Grill	3
Omg is all I can say! Ate here yesterday and it was AMAZING!!!! The baked beans are so good as well as the mac and cheese! All the meat is seasoned so good I didn't even need bbq sauce! I will definitely be coming back here again when I'm out this way!	5	John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill	4.5

Deliciousness, nutritiousness, and and abundance of yummy goodness. My favorite item on the menu is the spicy veggie juice. Every time I get it I instantly feel better. I also really love the super smoothies with either the fruit or granola. Everything at Go Raw is delightful and fresh and organic. Try it. You will feel so much healthier!!

"The service was fine. The kitchen cooks are a mess. This place is highly expensive and the food came out cold. Too many menu selections to choose from. The cold sandwich was the only thing that came out right. 

As for the chocolate fondu with cheese cake, brownies and strawberries were amazing. Stick to the sweets.

"Update: just came from having lunch here. In short, nothing special. This pizza I can get anywhere. Skimpy on the onions and they weren't even chopped up. Almost choked. Super sad, used to be great. Closest thing to NYC pizza this valley had. Not great anymore. Same mediocre Las Vegas pizza. 

Update: place has been sold and is under new management. Not great. Service was friendly enough, but the pizza? Not great. There's something different about it. And not in a good way. Won't be going back for a while. 

Only place I will go for pizza in the entire valley!! Pizza is consistently good. Service is beyond amazing and friendly. Brings me back to NY and my childhood!"	2	Gianna's Pizza	4
"This is an edit\/update since my review last week. It was a head over heals different experience. The food was excellent. The service was wonderful. Thank you for restoring my faith back In this establishment.  I will be back. I will tell friends to go. The roasted red pepper hummas is a new fave! I will be coming back for that. Next time I'm going to try the raw nachos. They sound delightful!!

Oh. My. Goddess. First Friday in October. We were the last people in line cause they ran out of food. I can see why. I got the burnt ends burrito with slaw, duck fat furies, a delectable aioli all in a tortilla. This is one of the greatest things I have ever eaten. Every aspect was perfect and the melding of all the flavors was stupendous. And it was my birthday too. This food truck produces magick. Can't wait to try the torta!!	5	Truck U Barbeque	4.5
"Can we just start off by saying how 
FRIENDLY the staff is? I ordered the eggs Benedict. Hollandaise made to order?? It was perfect. Eggs were poached perfectly. The ham was a little thick for my taste, but not worth taking ""points"" off for everything else. The Hubbster got the Rueben omelet. Delightful in all ways. The Bagel. OMG. Friggin perfect. When toasted it was crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy on the inside. Bagelmania is now my go to for bagels and lox. FANTASTICKA!!"	5	Harrie's Bagelmania	4
I had been looking forward for this spot to open and I have not been disappointed. I find the space warms and inviting and feel as though I am in a small eatery in Mexico. My husband ordered the Torta Pierna. He found it had a nice kick and was more sandwich than he was expecting, but the taste was so delightful he finished it in spite of being full. I ordered the chicken taco special. I found this dish good, but a wee bit on the bland side. I have had the single taco as well with the mole and limes. It's the first item on the menu, the name is escaping me, I apologize. But THAT is fantastic. All they need to do is spice up the food and kick it up a notch or two and this could be a nifty little gem here in the valley. OH! They have real Coke, in bottles, made with sugar! Hey, I was excited.	4	Las Cazuelas	4.5
"This is gonna be short & sweet...
The Positives:
The chicken is great, which is good because that's what Cane's is known for. The sauce is pretty good too. And I do enjoy the ""toast"" (half of a New England style hotdog bun), when it's warm. 
The Negatives:
The fries are soggy, ergo under cooked. 
The slaw is runny, and as another Yelper stated, bland as hell. And it seems to be the only available side other than the aforementioned soggy fries. 
The fact that you have to pay extra for those sauce is ridiculous. I'm buying a meal, gimme some extra sauce for pity's sake, what does it cost? Pennies? 

In short, go there for the chicken, that's it. Maybe the toast of you hit them in a good day...but pass on everything else."	3	Raising Cane's	3.5
"Food: FAN-F*CKING-TASTIC!!!
Service: AH-maxing!
Location: Perfect. 
As per the suggestion of many, many friends I finally tried this place. And because I live around the corner. It's a little spendy, but totally worth it. We got the pad Thai and the pork fried rice. No the dishes were cooked to perfection and there were left overs. Told the hubbster we need to go in and sit down to eat, as the atmosphere was lovely. I will be coming here on a very regular basis. Can't wait to try the duck curry next!!"	5	Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant	4
Don't bother. Food was served cold & had to be sent back. Hummas made me sick and the Riesling was questionable. Seriously, don't eat here. Parsley or Yanni's would be better choices.	1	Ali Baba Cuisine	3

"I was starving.

I saw the poor reviews, yet I was to the point of starvation that I was contemplating chewing on my arm which is why I came here.

I am glad I did because my food was fresh, hot and tasty.  I had the spicy chicken sandwich.

Customer service was friendly.

Yes the prices are higher than a regular Wendy's, but you are at the airport.  It's to be expected."	4	Wendy's	2.5
I was expecting to be blown away by the food. The atmosphere is excellent, but the service was fair. $12.88 for a cup of Hot and Sour it had better be the best Hot and Sour I have ever tasted. It was average at best the entrees all seem to be pre-made possibly just a buffet in the back. You're better off going to PF Changs they have much better food  and a quarter of the price.	2	Jasmine	3.5
"A must when in Vegas.

Bomb.  Tacos.

Al pastor and chorizo are my favorites.

"My girls and I came here for a bachelorette party and we had a great time.

The limo from this club picked us up at our hotel for free, of course we tipped.  We paid $30 and that got us in and it gets you a coupon for 2 drinks.

The lady walking around bringing the drinks tells you that you must tip her and she is really mean about it.  If you don't tip well enough she will stand next to you and repeat that you must tip.  What if you didn't earn a good tip because of your bitchy ass attitude?  but, whatever.

The guys there, some are good, some aren't the best, but some are awesome.

All in all, it was fun and my girls made it funner and so we had a great time.

We had a great time!"	5	Scarpetta	4
"We were thrilled to try this place out since they have awesome reviews but we were very disappointed with the service.  They had a lot of tables at the bar empty but dirty.  My friends and I sat at a table that was dirty and waited a while before someone acknowledged us and came to clean the table.  I didn't get his name, but he was kinda rude when taking our order.  He is Hispanic and wears glasses.  Fortunately someone else brought out our food and he was super nice, an Asian young man.

Came to their happy hour and had the following:

Salmon with truffle- truffle bechamel with portobello mushroom= this dish was very tasty! I liked that their salmon didn't taste fishy.

Traditional Spanish chicken croquetas- chicken bechamel= I really enjoyed this crunchy goodness.

Pintxo de chorizos- pork chorizo and mashed potatoes= their chorizo was a bit spicy and sweet, i liked their mashed potatoes.

Albondigas- beef and pork meatballs in a tomato sherry sauce=. Omg I loved loved this one, reminded me of my moms albondigas.

Stuffed dates- medjol dates, goat cheese, pancetta, tomato marmalade= Although this has a lot of good reviews this was overly sweet for me and was more like a dessert.

Their sangria was delicious and strong.

The 3 stars are for the tasty tapas and even better prices since it was happy hour.  Minus 2 for service."	3	Julian Serrano Tapas	4
"The Man and I came to see Steve Aioki and this place was dangerously packed.  Don't they have a max due to the fire code?

We paid the $100 per ticket VIP tickets.  What a joke.  We still stood in an hour long line.

We were warned by the guy tending to the elevators that it would get even worse.  By the way I made the mistake of stepping into an elevator and pushed the button only to be scolded to not touch the button.  I laughed since I thought he was joking.  The elevator attendant takes his job very seriously.

In order to have any sort of breathing room without having someone's privates all up on me or having my ass groped, which I encountered as we were looking for a place to at least stand, we felt we had no choice but to purchase a booth.

You buy a booth, but at the end of the night the place is super packed that you get people sneaking into your booth.  We caught someone trying to take a bottle of our vodka.  Security?

Skip this joint."	1	Hakkasan Nightclub	2.5
"I'm so glad this place is open 24 hours...we stumbled, literally into this place after the club (5am?)  and we definitely needed food...

I vaguely remember what I had, it was the chorizo with eggs and it was delicious, our waitress was such a sweetheart.

It was awesome!"	5	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
"* Ahi Poke Tostadas = Jalapeno-onion escabeche, tomatillo relish, avocado aioli - HELLA BOMB
* Truffle Lobster Mac N Cheese = Creamy tallegio-marscapone sauce w\/ maine lobster & black truffle - Amazing
* El Caliente = beef patty topped w\/ pepperjack cheese, pickled jalapeno, avocado, pork chicharrones & tequila cilantro mayo - my mouth is watering just remembering...I loved it.

Highly recommend!"	5	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4
"Got a free sandwich coupon when I signed up for their emails, score!

When you're in Vegas it's hard to find a good spot to eat that won't leave a dent in your wallet.

This place has hella good sandwiches at very reasonable prices, and they're open 24 hrs a day which is why we came numerous times lol.

Chipotle chicken avocado- I love avocados so this was my second favorite sandwich.

The full montagu- I'm not a fan of roast beef so I should have skipped this one, it's tasty just not for me :)

Italian-  the least of my favorites, I didn't care for the Italian dressing they use.  I wouldn't get it again.

The American-  it's not on the menu but they will make it for you.  I loved it!!!  My favorite.

They also have their own kettle chips and I really liked their salt and vinegar chips."	5	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"The line here was huge and it's all hype.

I was very disappointed with my greasy cheeseburger and overly sweet strawberry shake.

The only good thing were the fries :\/"	2	Shake Shack	4
"Stayed here at the end of October and it was an ok experience.  Price wise it was cheaper than the other hotels on the strip.  Like the other Yelpers stated, the line to check in was soo long, I must have stood there for about 45 minutes.  

Ok, so I got a non-smoking room.  I walked into my room and it reeked of smoke.  Called the front desk and asked what kind of room was I given? It was confirmed that it was non-smoking.  I can just imagine how the smoking rooms must stink!

Walls are paper thin.  One night there was a party next door, sounded like a bachelorette party.  The following night I figured it might be somewhat less noisy, and what did I get on the other side? a couple that must have been making a porno movie.  Granted, it's Vegas, the city that never sleeps..but damn after gambling, drinking and dancing you want to catch a couple of zzzz's to have the energy to do it again for the next couple of days.

Ordered room service and food was yummy and hot..the people that bring up the food are super nice.  

A plus: You can checkout using your tv..and you leave your key in your room."	3	MGM Grand Hotel	3
"Our recent visit was on Friday 11\/7\/14 with a group of 11 girls.  We opted to sit inside since the wait for a table outside was 1.5 hrs.

Guacamole - was delicious
Calamari - it was ok
Spicy Grilled Gulf Shrimp fajitas - the shrimp were humongous and delicious.  This gets 5 stars easily.
Chicken Sabana - Another amazing plate....would get next time for sure.

Service was good, our food took kind of long to come out, but I guess it was because we had a big party.

Will def come back when in Vegas."	5	Cabo Wabo Cantina	3.5
The seafood buffett at El Rio was soooo delicious.  It is a bit pricey, but you certainly get your money's worth.  They have all kinds of fish, garlic prawns, breaded prawns, etc, the best part is the crab.  YUMM those crab legs with all kinds of dipping sauces, were so delish.  I want to go to Vegas just to go have dinner there again!!  Definetely a must if you go to Vegas!!	5	Village Seafood Buffet	3.5
"10\/7\/16- Came here after the Club and it was super busy, nevertheless the line moved fast and the drunken patrons kept us entertained!

White pizza with sausage and mushrooms...can't go wrong with that!

The guys here are super friendly!"	5	Secret Pizza	4
"Holy shitake mushrooms.  You gotta order the Chicken and Waffles.  And no, it doesn't come with mushrooms.

The fried chicken was a bit underwhelming due to the overly batter taste and lack of crispiness, but the meat was succulent enough to overlook the fact.  Douse that shit in ketchup with a dash of Tabasco.

As for the other half, best waffles ever.  Your entree is presented on an extremely hot plate.  No touch!  It keeps the butter melted and the Wild Turkey infused maple syrup tasting like adult pole dancing heaven.  Don't pour the butter and syrup on your waffles.  DIP your waffles into the butter first and then the syrup.  Proceed to pinch your nipples as you eat them.  It adds to the flavor.

If you wanna rockstar it, order a glass of Johnny Walker to compliment the waffles and 86 the chicken.  Whiskey and Waffles.  Best breakfast ever."	4	First Food & Bar	3.5
Yum!  Order the garlic fried rice with . . . everything!  We've been there twice and everything we've tried so far has been so good, I can't wait to go back -- and we live in L.A.!	5	BabyStacks Cafe	4
Looking at all the reviews, I was expecting it to be fabulous.  First, we had reservations for 6:45 and we didn't get seated until after 7:00.  Other people came in after we checked in and were seated before us.  We were the last ones waiting.  I was already unhappy.  After we were seated, it took 15 minutes before I had to tell our server we were ready to order.  When we finally got our steaks (NY, filet, Spencer, and ribeye) and they were just okay.  I ordered the ribeye and I thought they gave me the NY steak.  No marbling and no flavor!!  No one was impressed with their steaks.  I had a more flavorful filet at TGIFridays!!  This was really disappointing! :(	2	Echo & Rig	4.5
Holy moly!  We waited in line for an hour and 45 minutes.  The only thing that was getting me through that wait was the thought of ayce king crab legs!  We finally made it in around 9pm and they only had snow crab and stone crab!  What happened to the king crab???  Fine, I had snow crab and it was just okay.  I wandered around to see what they offered and I must say that it was all about presentation.  The fried chicken, tater tots, fish & chips were offered in little wire fry baskets.  Each slider was placed on its own little ceramic dish.  Oh, and they have street vendor food -- corn on the cob slathered with mayo and crumbly cheese (where's the paletas??). They also have a charcuterie along with different types of cheeses.  I was excited about that.  I wanted to order wine with the meats and cheeses and found out it is not possible to order one glass of wine.  If you want wine, you have to order all-you-can-drink wine for $15.99 (on top of the $39.99 you just paid for dinner).  Anyway, we were a party of 6 and we tried everything.  A lot of the items were really salty so we needed a lot of water.  (Maybe they do this on purpose so you get full on water and don't each so much??  Guess they gotta recoup that $18MM somehow...).  For a buffet, the presentation is great, but the food is mediocre.  If you like to see your food sitting in something pretty, eat here.  If you want good food, go to the M.	2	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"This is absolutely one of the best and authentic Chinese restaurants in US based on my limited experience. 

The food are very ""Mama"" made. Both the taste and the size of the dishes are very good. I just hope I have a big enough stomach!!"	5	China Mama Restaurant	3.5
DROOL...I stayed in the Palazzo which means that everyday I walked by this place and had to get something.  The lemon ice thing is really good as well as their chocolate and vanilla.  For ice cream though, they are pricy.	5	Espressamente illy	3.5
If you need a party or big event catered I highly recommend Michoacan Restaurant. The food was absolutely delicious it arrived hot and right on time and there was so much of it!  From the first phone call I was put at ease and was not disappointed.  We had the fajitas and everything came with it the beans and rice and guacamole all of it was fresh and good. We Thank You Michoacan for making our party a success!!!	5	Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant	3.5
"Food was fresh and the staff is very nice.
The best I have had.  The hummus was great the Babaganoush was okay.  The meat dishes and rice were also great !!
Def my spot for Greek food!"	4	Pita House	4.5
"The place was clean and service was pretty good.  They were busy on a Friday night.
The soft shell crab was great.  The Uni was sublime very fresh. The owner paid us a visit at our table at the end of the night and was very pleasant and upbeat and even gave us a free dish to try.  Fresh fish!! I will be back"	4	Soho Japanese Restaurant	4.5
almost nothing about this place was good they are not sure what they are and they certainly aren't serving good food the fusion that they are trying to do doesn't work however they were very nice I will never eat here again	2	Gangnam Street	4.5
"I don't know what is wrong with that Bonnie L who wrote a rhyming review just to be funny but it was stupid.
This place is a hidden gem it is real fresh and I imagine this is like getting a home cooked meal in China.  The lamb skewers were Soooooo good.  Dry wontons were amazing and the dumplings were great!! You cannot beat the bang for the buck here and everyone is super nice !!! Highly recommend you try this place out!"	5	Booming Pot Noodles	4
"The best bargain you will ever find in Vegas!  Absolutely Fresh Food no waiting line .  Great  multi-grain pancakes (big!) and you want the sausage which tastes slightly better than the patties. Absolutely HUGE ham steak. A real monster and likely you will take some home.
 ZERO discrepancies in last health inspection.  5th year of owner small business.
The restrooms sparkle due to Kelly's diligence and she's a great waitress too!!"	5	The Diner at LVM Resort	4.5
I had been waiting for this place to open and today I was the first customer.  First off the place is clean and staff very friendly and helpful.  They have a variety of fresh toppings and the fresh doh is great and soft.  This is truly Italy pizza.  They also have other food which I'm sure is great! Gelato too!  I was even quite impressed that the red pepper shakers have the flakes finally chopped up so they actually go through the shaker which shows that they pay attention to everything and the qualty was excellent.  I will be a regular here for sure and I grew up on New York and NJ pizza.	5	Novecento Pizzeria	4
"The beef was fair and over seasoned and dry.
The pita is mediocre not tasty or fresh too doughy.
Service was friendly. The chicken greek salad was decent  with so many other choices I probably would not go back"	3	Stephano's Greek & Mediterranean Grill	4
Well I was there last Sunday and waited almost 20 minutes for two sandwiches.  The roast beef was acceptable but the turkey was low grade.  If they are charging 10 bucks for a sandwich it better have fresh carved meat not something I can buy in a pre-wrapped package at the supermarket.  I think this place can be great but they need to fix their speed and quality of meats.  I will likely go elsewhere next time unless they improve.	2	Beach Hut Deli	4
"Better than the strip!!!
Stopped in for lunch and ordered 3 street tacos had the chili verde, lamb and pasture and all were great and tasty well seasoned but adding the salsas was even better !
Salsas all great and fresh! Cannot wait to go back for dinner!"	5	Salud Mexican Bistro and Tequileria	5
I have eaten here a few times and never disappointed. Chef usually comes to say hello and tells you about the fresh ingredients that he is using for the same day which is great. You can see his passion and taste the passion in his food hidden gem off the strip best meatballs ever!!	5	Chef Marc's Trattoria	4.5
"I had gift certificates for this place for a while and finally cashed them in! What was I waiting for ?  Hands down THE BEST Osso Bucco I have ever had.  Our waiter Justin said it would be the best according to Chef and it was!!! Perfectly cooked, seasoned almost perfect ( I would have added Kalamata Olives ) pasta that was paired with it was perfect.  Portion was on point.  
Now back to the appetizer, a very fresh calamari with broccoli rabe and peppers, tomatoes and potatoes in a beautiful sauce.  I don't even eat octopus anymore because I discovered it was very intelligent so I made a conscious effort to stop eating them however I may have to eat that calamari once a month along with the osso bucco.
The Tiramisu was great just a bit soggy\/juicy for me but great!  This place is as good as any place on the strip for Italian food. I was so impressed went and shook the Chefs hand after meal well done. Gordon Ramsay would be proud and not have much to say except ""Brilliant and clearly passionate about your restaurant"	5	Mastrioni's	4
We were very excited to try the burger and waited in line for about 40 minutes. Then nightmare started as our server didn't attend to us until 20 minutes after. We ordered 3 burgers and waited close to 40 minutes. I figured this cheap burger better be good after waiting that long!!! Finally our burgers came but lo and behold!!! We got a freaking cold burger!!! After that hellish experience, never again will we ever go to this place!!! Beware all ya'll!!!	1	Steak 'n Shake	3.5
"We were eager to try this place for years and finally on a fathers day event, we did it, but what a disappointment!!!
From beginning our server was not fully engaged to help us, we felt that it was an inconvenience to ask for anything even a simple chimichuri was like pulling teeth. The food overall was somewhat ok. We didn't even get a chance to see what desserts they offer. Asking to open a bottle of wine was an inconvenience. Our overall experience was poor!!! Texas de Brazil is still the best from the moment you walk in, to dining and upon leaving. Sadly, we're not going back to this place."	2	Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse	4.5
Talk about a great Mexican experience!  These guys are the bomb.  I always start with the queso fundido, and then any number of options (accompanied by a pitcher of their margaritas, of course).  Been coming here for over 10 year and will continue to do so.	5	Dona Maria Tamales Restaurant	3.5
"Michael's used to be the best anywhere.  It held court in the Barbary Coast but it's food was better than The Venetian or The Mandalay Bay.  It was the first place in town to serve stone crab.  It was THE experience you couldn't miss.

Now, however, out at the South Point, the quality has faded.  The waiters no longer strive so hard to create that one of a kind experience.  It's like they chose to get by on as little effort as they could.

Sad to see the quality go so far to the south.  It's time to close the brand and put it ouot of it's misery."	2	Michael's Gourmet Room	4.5
Great on so many levels.  Timely delivery to my home, as well as when dining in the restaurant.  The freshest of ingredients with enticing aromas the lure you in from the moment that you walk through the door.	5	Jacky Chan	3
"Fast & pleasant service two days in a row..
Hubby had Turkey, Avocado Eggs Benedict both days..
I had a typical bacon, eggs. & potato breakfast the first day., but the subconscious day I had the famous pancakes & bacon..
They come with. 3 homemade jellies..
So delish..
I also had a shrimp cocktail .. All shrimp no filler.  Yummy"	5	Du-Par's	4

One of, if not the best pizzas I've had here in Vegas.  Got the Sicilian and was definitely impressed.  I will be back soon!	5	Familia Pizzeria	4
"This place is close to home, and I went for a quick dinner after seeing the menu and the happy hour specials.  I thought I was going to get some small, barely edible appetizers, and it would still cost me a ton of money and that I would soon regret this decision....but I went anyways.

Well.......I will definitely be back!  Their $5.00 happy hour appetizers are GREAT!  Big portions, great taste, and friendly staff.  We had a total of 6 appetizers (nachos, quesadilla, wings, spring rolls, cheese sticks, crab cakes) and 5 drinks.......drum roll.......the bill was $40.00 even.  So their advertised prices include tax.  Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	5	Sagos Baja Tavern & Lounge	4
Had never tried their pizza before, but now that they've opened 3 miles from my home, I couldn't wait to give them a try.  EXCELLENT!  I am ordering again in a couple of days for dinner again.  I ordered the 1\/4 sheet (6 slices) with pepperoni.  I can't wait to try more items on the menu.	5	Naked City Pizza Express	3
Been here a couple times and they never dissappoint.  The food is always great, great portions and the staff is very friendly.  Glad it's close to home.  Way better than most of the other Hawaiian places in town.	5	Island Flavor	4.5
"You have no idea how badly I wanted to give this place five stars I just couldn't- it's Italian restaurant if you can't get the pasta right forget about it.

Ok - here goes: on a recent business trip to Vegas one of the restaurants that caught our eye was Chef Paul Bartolotta's - Bartolotta Ristorante di Mare at the Wynn. Chef Paul offers a pretty simple straightforward Italian menu that is touted as being out of this world because he imports 1.5 tons of FRESH NOT FROZEN seafood each week from cities that lie along the coast of the Mediterranean. 

My spouse who was born and raised in northern Italy sat up and took notice as many of the food items on this menu hadn't crossed his lips since was a teenager and young adult- so it was a no brainer to try it out. And besides all that's it's Las Vegas! And Las Vegas is all about once-in-a-lifetime experiences and this Chef won his share of awards so why not.

I made sure I booked well in advance which is a very smart thing to do. I also booked early because I wasn't sure how long dinner would take - I really don't like eating late in the evening and I wanted to take my time. 

This place I would describe as semi-dressy. I wore slacks and a very dressy blouse. My spouse wore slacks, very nice open shirt no tie or jacket. They do not allow for instance, flip-flops, shorts of any kind, athletic wear, or pool wear.

We had three servers and a wine sommelier. Upon arrival there is a big bar to the left and a winding staircase that has the most unique looking chandelier I've ever seen completely made up of fish! As we proceeded down to our table to core was done and creams and white and gold with all kinds of decorations from the sea.

After we were seated, welcomed,  and our drink order was taken our head waiter who is from Ireland greeted us and rolled out their fresh fish cart. It was amazing to see what in a while we would be eating. It doesn't get get much fresher than that. 

We began with SCAMPI VIVI - renowned as 'the single best live langoustines on the planet' 

Just be prepared :

large .... $30. each - extra large .... $35. each - jumbo .... $40. each - extra jumbo .... $45. each. ( that's for each shrimp) I personally have never had this kind of shrimp before and it was worth every single, solitary, morsel, delicious, amazing, orgasmic bite

We then decided ""You only live once"" so we ordered the Bravo's Top Chef menu at 180.00 clams per person. They bring you the best of the best.

They served us the following in small plates:

alici marinati which were marinated Mediterranean anchovies. they were not my flavor but my spouse inhaled them:)

Insalata di piovra Ligure which is Ligurian octopus salad, olive oil, lemon. The texture was tender and perfect.

Saute di vongole sautéed clams, white wine, tomato. These clams however we're from Washington state - although fresh I was disappointed. Don't misunderstand they were delicious but I was under the impression they would be coming from Italy.

cappesante dorate con porcini - these were seared sea scallops, porcini mushrooms, parmigiano-reggiano - they were deliciougrigliata mista di gamberi, scampi, aragosta - grilled shrimp, langoustine, spiny lobster - another huge hit!!!

ravioli di ricotta con caciotta Toscana - sheep's milk ricotta ravioli, pecorino cheese, Marsala wine glaze. LOVED THIS!

And this is where things began to go sideways hence 4 stars not 5. :( :( :( 

rigatoni con scorfano e melanzane rigatoni, clams, scallops, shrimp, lobster, cuttlefish, octopus. The seafood was fine but the pasta was way under cooked. Chewy. 

risotto ai frutti di mare - risotto, clams, scallops, shrimp, lobster, cuttlefish, octopus. Again the seafood was fine but the result though was crunchy and we sent back *twice*.

penne con ragu di crostacei - penne, lobster, shrimp, crab, white wine, tomato. This was undercooked and weird. Way too much tomato with beautiful beautiful seafood.

Now the shining star of the night besides the amazing shrimp was a whole fish that was prepared in rock-salt called  Brazino which is European Sea bass. Delicate and lovely served with a light lemon sauce. It's filleted and carved and serve table-side over capers and lightly sautéed zucchini.

Heavenly.

For dessert they served a sinfonia di dolci or a symphony of desserts. They were all lovely and delicate and a great way to end the evening.

The other piece to this that I found odd- there was no wine pairing offered with this amazing chef's tasting. So feedback to the restaurant: offer wine pairing! You have this amazing wine steward who really knows his stuff that could make you money and showcase your seafood even more as well as your amazing wines. And of course if the pasta isn't prepared correctly it can really wreck the main part of the dish. Crunchy risotto is icky. 

Service: impeccable

We dropped over $500. It was an experience of a lifetime. If you can and you love seafood you should give this a try at least once."	4	Costa di Mare	3.5

Whenever I recommend places to check out in Vegas I never fail to mention this establishment. The food is phenomenal, the drinks are superb, and the service is fantastic. Make sure to bring your appetite because this place does not play around with their gigantic portions. Definitely a place you have to check out on your journey to food euphoria.	5	Hash House A Go Go	4

"This place is amazing value,  if you book online you can get it as low as $15 and night,  we wound up paying $30,  but compared to the $500 alternatives,  there is nothing to grumble about. 

The rooms are spacious and colorful,  it's a short walk to the elevators,   you can walk to the strip from the hotel and the pool is open 24 hours!   

Hell you even get a free chicken wings and beer for 15 cents if you take them up of the special offers!

I've stayed here 3 times now - just for a weekend,  and if you are doing it on  your own dime,  I don't see any point in going anywhere else.     Sure the Palazzo and The Hotel are great,   but are they really worth spending that extra $200-$300 on,  when that money could be going to towards the Aria buffet!

Need I say more!"	5	Hooters Casino Hotel Las Vegas	2.5
This restaurant has the best food and a wonderful warm atmosphere. The owner and staff are warm and friendly -- great people! I love the quotes on the walls. It is a quaint place, less than a dozen tables, so you won't be treated like it's a franchise. I go there almost once a week. I highly recommend it to everyone.	5	Zaytoon Restaurant	4.5
Probably the best Peruvian and Mexican food I have tasted from a food truck in Vegas by far. Much better than actual Mexican restaurants as well!! And the prices are great. I recommend the Lomo Saltado, one of my personal favorites when it comes to Peruvian food. Also, s\/o to Tim and Norma (owners), they are very friendly and cook delicious food!! Highly recommend	5	Inca Vs Azteca	4.5
Authentic Korean BBQ. I do recommend this place for anyone who loves Korean food. We have tried the original Bimbimbap; it is really good.	5	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5
"My friend and I went to breakfast on a Thursday morning at the Flamingo location.  The staff was very friendly.  Adam was our server, who was helpful about the menu items and very attentive about our particular requests (water no ice, Cooking spray vs butter for the omelet, etc).

The steak and eggs breakfast was some of the best I have had in a while.  I enjoyed a treat with the Pot O'Bread, requesting the cream cheese syrup on the side instead of butter.  It was yummy-moan-worthy-goodness.

Their organic hot sauce has sadly spoiled me from all others.  If I use Tapatio, Cholula or Tabasco at another restaurant, I find myself thinking fondly of Rise & Shine's hot sauce... which I had to purchase."	5	Rise & Shine a Steak & Egg Place	4
I ate here with friends after they renewed their wedding vows. I am sad to be leaving this teppanyaki behind. I will dream about it fortnightly. After sampling the yum yum sauce as well as the ridiculously delicious fried rice, I tried to convince the chef to move to Arizona. The chicken was tender and perfection. Don't forget to add sake. We enjoyed the Kurosawa and Drunken Whale. Also, be sure to tell them you like the fat on your steak. They will grill it up and incorporate it into a sauce that will make you propose to the chef--who would only identify himself as Sum Yung Cook. You're always welcome in Tucson Sum Yung Cook!	5	Musashi Japanese Steakhouse	4
This place is overly priced and the food was horrible. Everything was bland and small proportioned. The spaghetti and meatballs tasted worse than the frozen ones at the market. The margarita pizza was bland and had no sauce on it. The "crispy" French fries were thick cut and soggy, not crispy at all. The chip and artichoke dip was decent but so very small for the price. Don't go here, go across the street and go to the Cabo restaurant; it's so much cheaper, tastes better, and bigger portioned.	1	HEXX kitchen + bar	4
They suck at helping their customers. They forgot about us and I had to wait 1 hour just to order my food even after hollering at multiple waiters. Their 45 minute wait was a waste of time and this is my second chance for this restaurant. HIRE BETTER STAFF.	1	Serendipity 3	3
I was very happy with my experience here. Many folks turn their nose up at the old school downtown Vegas experience compared to the strip, but I found it to be more authentic and down to earth than the over-the-top glitz of Las Vegas Blvd. It's a bit older looking but the service and hotel rooms were quite satisfactory. You can also take a photo next to a glass case containing $1,000,000 in cash!	4	Binion's Gambling Hall	3
This place is superb from the customer service to the food. If you are in the area, I highly recommend trying this place out! You will not be disappointed.	5	Delmonico Steakhouse	4

"Mgm is dirty and old.  My main complaint is on checkout the mgm checkout man forced me to pay a 129 dollar room tax that I already paid through the travel agent 

When I tried to call mgm it is impossible to talk to anyone. This is a scam and I was taken for two taxes.  I will never stay here again it is much better at treasure island or father down the strip. This area is not as fun probably why trump built in the better area

Ps try calling mgm and talking to someone about a bill over the phone"	1	MGM Grand Hotel	3
Came here with my family again and my wife's out of town relatives.  There were 10 of us all together and Raku advised they would do a prefix menu for a party this size ($50 per person), so that they can have some food prepared and that the food would flow better to each person, instead of waiting for each individual order to cook.  We did request some things to be included in the prefix menu, kobe beef skirt steak, duck, and the crunchy asparagus.  I gotta say this trip was better than last.  We had over 10 dishes each.  The pork cheeks and skirt steak were awesome, though I recommend dipping it in the sauce it comes with for extra flavor.  All in all, every dish that came out was good.  Still wish they had quail eggs wrapped in bacon.  =)	4	Raku	4.5
Came back hear again.  The tortilla sizes seemed smaller or same size as other taco restaurants like these =(, however, they still piled on the meats =).  Had the lengua taco, which was ok, and the adobada tacos, which were great like last time.  Next thing to try, adobada fries...	4	Tacos El Gordo	4
"This is the best ramen noodle shop that I've been to in Las Vegas.  I have eaten at Kaigenro, Ichiza, and elsewhere, but this place is the best in my opinion.

I like the tonkotsu ramen with extra pork.  The broth is great and the noodles are cooked well.  The pork slice is thin and still has some fat layers on it, which adds to the flavor.  I don't get grossed out by it because it is YUMMY!  If you have a saltier taste bud, you might try the tonkotsu\/shoyu broth combination.  Personnally, I like the regular tonkotsu best, but you won't go wrong with the combination broth.  I have also tried their gyoza, which was ok and nothing special, but hey, I'm here for the ramen and pork. =)

The only issue I have about this place is the price or serving size.  The ramen bowl is $6.99.  If you have a decent appetite, you'd have to order extra noodles ($1.50) or extra pork ($2.50), which is ok.  However, if you have a bigger appetite, you might have to order gyoza or other side dishes in addition, which can increase the overall cost of your meal.

If you have tried Shinsengumi in LA, this restaurant is the most similar in taste.  I would come here again and again, but not if I am really hungry and don't want to pay for the extras."	4	Monta Ramen	4
Pizza was good.  We had a thin crust (regular) pizza with pepperoni and mushroom.  This place is better than the pizza chains nearby like Pizza Hut.  However, it is not as good as Grimaldi's.  I don't know about the other reviewers, but the asian guy at the front was really nice and gave good service.	4	8th Ave Pizza	3
"The first time I went here, I had the 3 bao combo for $10.  I had two pork belly baos, one with duck and Sprite in a glass bottle.  Although the pork belly baos were good, I have to say I liked the duck bao a little bit better.  The skin was crispy and the meat was great.  Unfortunately, after I left, I realized I was still hungry and went home hungry.  So, I actually ate leftovers at home.  Overall, though the food was good, the portions are a little small for me and was left unsatisfied.  I suggest they have a 4 bao combo for $12.  Also, I was the only one there and had to wait a while to get my food.

During the second time, I thought I would try their sesame chicken noodle dish and also had a duck bao.  The noodle dish was good and filled me up a bit more than the first time I went.  It had the right level of spiciness for me as well.  The duck bao was still good.  There were a few more people there when I went this time.  I was second in line and a few more came after me.  Again, I had to wait a while to get the food.  I felt bad for the people that came after me, as their wait was longer (20 min and counting when I left).

I wish I could give this place more stars like the other reviewers.  I have no complaints about the taste, but I don't think it is worth the money and time.  With the size of the baos and the meat portions, I think it would be a good price if it was 50 cents less.  The sesame noodle is a better value at $6, instead of $7.  Contrary to another reviewer, I thought The Chairman food truck's pork belly baos were way better.  Though it was a little more expensive, the taste, bao size, and meat portion was worth the price.  Unfortunately, they were only visiting Vegas for a special event and reside in San Francisco.

I would still recommend people to try this place out, if you want to try bao sandwiches.  They are good as a snack.  Expect a little wait."	3	Great Bao	4.5
"Best pizza in Las Vegas!!  I always get a large pepperoni and sausage pizza here.  I normally order pepperoni and mushroom at other places, but the mushroom makes the pizza a little soggy here.  Regardless, the pepperoni and sausage combination is excellent for me.  The mozarella cheese is unlike any other compared to the pizza places around here.  Plus, the pepperoni is fantastic, the right combination of spices and the tasty sausage complements it very well.  The thin crust is cooked perfectly, as it is not too crispy and not toooo limp and soggy.  As noted, I always get a large and eat the left overs the next morning or lunch.  It does not lose its taste.

I share the mediterranean salad with my wife.  The portions are huge, so we order a small.

The service is excellent here, but does get busy around 6-730pm during the weekends.  So, you might expect some wait time during those hours.

Great place to go if you have kids.  The waiter sometimes give kids pizza dough to play with.

Whenever I have visitors from out of town and want to experience something new, but don't want to go to the Strip, this place is one of my first suggestions, when they are in the mood for Italian\/American.

The pizza is a little pricey if you compare it to pizza chains, but this place is well worth it.  The great taste and service is consistent, which keeps me coming back.

If you join their email list, they send you great deals, such as getting a free large pizza (dine-in) during your birthday week..."	5	Grimaldi's Pizzeria	4
"If you're in the mood and have a craving for crab and don't mind peeling and deshelling the sweet and juicy meat, then this is the place for you!

Crab Corner is a small restaurant and when we got there on a Friday night, it was already crowded and had to wait about 15-20 minutes.  There was a large party that was just being seated.  I think they accept reservations, so I would recommend making one before you go.  There was no sign up sheet, but the owners and crew knew the order and offered us seats, while we waited.

The customer service was excellent and with that alone, they would get 5 stars.  My wife said they get 10 in her book.  They were very attentive and helped us with the menu, since it was our first time there.  When the crab came, they showed us how to open the crab up and tricks to get the meat.  We already knew how to do it, but wanted to see if they had special tricks of their own.  =)  The place was busy, but it wasn't just the waiter that came by and asked us how we were doing, but practically every worker came by and talked to us.  You can tell they were genuinely good folks.

We ordered their boardwalk fries, crab cake appetizers, and 6 large male blue crabs.  The fries and the crab cakes came out first.  The boardwalk fries were tasty and splashing malt vinegar on it made it even better.  Yum.  The crab cakes were a little small, but the menu did say each were 1 oz.  Other places compensate and add other stuff like bread stuffing and other fillings, but the good thing about Crab Corner's crab cakes were that it was practically all meat.  It wasn't earth shattering tasty goodness like this one restaurant in Baltimore, but it was still good.  The sauce that came with the crab cakes was a perfect complement and was a good start for the dinner.

Then our large crabs came.  They were out of the jumbo size.  The large size was smaller than expected, but again these are blue crabs, not dungenous crabs.  The meat was very sweet, soft and moist.  The seasoning was good and I liked licking it off my fingers while eating the crab meat.  heheh.  They also had extra seasoning on the side as well.  My wife and I didn't talk for a while, since we were all focusing on the food.  haha.  But again, the waiters and owners came by regularly to check up on us.  If you have little toddlers that get restless, you might want to get a babysitter, since you can be there for a while and your hands get messy.  There were other families there with kids, but I'm glad my sister-in-law babysat our little one that night. 

I wanted to check out this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews and was definitely happy with this place.  However, if you are in the mood for other shellfish and not just crab, you might want to go to other places like Hot and Juicy Crawfish, though this place offers other shellfish as well.  Note, I didn't try other shellfish like crawfish and shrimp here yet, but this is my gut feeling.  I paid the same amount in Crab Corner as in Hot and Juicy, but felt more ""stuffed"" at the latter.  However, Crab Corner definitely satisfied my crab craving and would come back here again.  I definitely want to try their other entrees and appetizers and of course, have some of the blue crab again (maybe jumbo next time)."	4	Crab Corner	4
"I have been to this place twice in the past two weeks and give this place 4 stars, as you can see with my rating. =)

The place was clean and the staff was helpful.  The first time we came, they only had two high chairs for kids.  We had 3 babies that needed high chairs.  Luckily, one of our friends brought their portable infant seat, so no problems.  The reason why I mentioned this is that the 2nd time we went, the week after, they had 5 high chairs.  Talk about addressing the customer's needs.  =)

We had the Pork Dumpling with Supreme soup.  This is basically a pork dumpling that has broth\/soup inside and comes out when you bite into it.  I normally pick up the dumpling and put it into a soup spoon, so I don't lose the broth when I bite into it.  It lets me slurp up the broth that falls into the spoon after.  My buddy puts the dumpling into a small bowl, so that the broth doesn't escape.  To each their own.  =)  I found the broth tasty and the dumpling delicious.  Note, this is the first time I have tried this dish anywhere, so I have nothing to compare it to.  Regardless, my taste buds liked it.  =) 

We got the Pork Dumpling with Supreme soup combination, which lets you pick from one of four soups they offer, I think...  I had the hot and sour soup.  The first week, it wasn't sour enough and was kinda bland.  The 2nd time it was fine for me.  I'll have to come back and see if they get consistent.  However, the bowl size is pretty large and just for an extra $1 with the combination, I'm not complaining.

Another dish we tried was the twice cooked pork.  If you like pork belly, do not get grossed out with fat, and not health conscious, I suggest you try this dish.  The pork belly and tofu is thinly sliced an tastes so good.  It is served in black bean sauce I think, so it has a slightly salty taste.  Note, it is normally served spicy, but we asked that the dish not be served spicy.  

Overall, I would come back here again."	4	Three Villages Restaurant	4
"For now, I will still give this place 4 stars although my meal was not that great.  ha.  

Service was great and our water was attentive.  The ambience was nice as well.  Our reservation was at 630pm on a Friday night.  This place is west of the strip, so I'm glad I didn't have to run into freeway and Strip traffic, and the casino crowds.  Parking was easy to find and we were seated right away when we went in.  It started to get busy towards 730 or so.

We had the meats and cheeses selection for appetizers and decided on a combination of 2 meats and 3 types of cheeses.  The sliced duck was surprisingly good and the prosciutto was great.  The cheeses we selected (sorry forgot the specifics) was tasty as well, aside from the goat cheese.

Now, the reason for my first comment above was that this was my night where my food picks were wrong, but everyone else I came with enjoyed their meals.  I got the lobster risotto, which was a special for the day.  Seeing enough Hell's Kitchen, where they offer risotto as a dish, I decided to give it a try. Plus, this was recommended by the waiter.  More often than not, when I rely on the waiter's recommendation, the dish turns out pretty good, but tonight was not the case.   First, I was expecting a lobster tail, maybe even a small one or half a tail.  But, all I got was a small claw and some rice for dinner.  So, I knew I was going to be starving.  Then, the risotti itself was bland and did not have much of a taste.  I bet you predicted I was asking my family to try their dishes during dinner.  haha.

As mentioned, the rest of my party enjoyed their selections.  My wife had osso buco and she enjoyed it pretty much.  It was a good size portion and she was pleased.  She savored the marrow last, which was still inside the bone.  My mother-in-law had the scallops and they were cooked just right.  My father-in-law had the bone-in ribeye and he enjoyed it very much.  He raved about how it was so good and soft the whole night.  I had a piece and it was pretty good.  He mentioned it was better than Ruth Chris and Flemings.  Hmm...Ruth Chris maybe, but it may be around Flemings caliber or a little under.  Then again, I just had a piece and he had the whole steak.  Next, my sister-in-law had Bouillabaisse.  She tried my risotto and agreed, no flavor.  She felt sorry for me and gave me a scallop, which was tasty.

Dessert time...  I had maple sugar creme brulee.  Creme brulee happens to be pretty high up on my dessert favorites.  It was pretty good, but the maple taste was a slight twist.  The maple taste reminded me of pancakes for breakfast.  Overall, I prefer the traditional creme brulee taste than the maple flavor, but would recommend others to try this dessert.  My wife had the lemon cheesecake and she thought it was one of the better cheesecakes she's had in a while.  Father-in-law was happy with his apple pie a-la mode, but we wasn't raving about it like he did with his rib-eye.  Mother and sister-in-law shared a dark chocolate dessert and they were really happy as well.

Given that we had an appetizer, a bottle of wine, dinner, and dessert, I was thinking at least $100 per head, but it turned out to be way less than that, which is definitely a plus.

So all-in-all, I got the wrong dish, but everyone else made the right selections.  With that said, I will definitely go back to this place for the service, ambience, and the fact that my family enjoyed their meals.  I just won't select lobster risotto ever."	4	Vintner Grill	4
"This place reminded me of a Vietnamese ""McDonald's"".  It gives off a fast food restaurant vibe, but the way they set up their ordering lines seemed disorderly at times.  People were confused whether there were 3 separate ordering lanes or just one single line...

We had the egg rolls.  It was already pre-made and was sitting in the warming case\/cabinet for lack of better words.  It was pretty weird that they didn't have any sauce for the egg rolls and lunchtime had just started...

We also had the grilled pork banh mi.  The sign said the sandwiches were 10 inches long and I initially thought it would be a good size sandwich.  Unfortunately, these baguettes were pretty thin or narrow.  The meat portion was ok, but more towards the slim side like the baguette.  haha.  The grilled pork was ok and wasn't bad...  The pickled vegetables were pretty good.  The sandwich was not soft and was not too hard, however, my upper palate was a little raw afterwards.

They were giving out samples of some type of waffle that had a green batter color in the inside.  That was surprisingly good.

Overall, this place was ok.  It wasn't horrible, however, I wouldn't come back, unless someone pulls my arm and asks me to give it another shot.  I've had better banh mi at other Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas and the fast food vibe didn't appeal to me."	3	Lee's Sandwiches	3
Definitely better than Beni Hana and any other Teppan Yaki place that I've been to.  I always make a reservation and request the owner, Tsutomo, to cook for us.  We eat here every 3 to 4 months, but Tsutomo somehow remembers all of our past conversations.  He definitely has a good memory and makes for an entertaining conversation during dinner with my family and friends.  His special sauces are the best.  I normally get the rib eye, but had my first taste of Kobe beef here, which was REALLY good.  Rib eye is a good choice if you don't want to spend as much, however, if you don't mind spending a little bit more, the Kobe beef was worth it.	5	Musashi Japanese Steakhouse	4
"I've come to this place several times now and I must say, I've been satisfied everytime.

I'd like to think of myself as an old-fashioned burger guy or purist, meaning I like to let the burger, cheese, and ketchup do the talking.  I'm fine with lettuce, tomato, fried onions, and at times, mushrooms and bacon.  I think having too much condiments and toppings ruins or hides the real flavor of the meat and cheese.


Having said that, I didn't think I would like this place too much as other burger fusion places I have tried before were just ok, but was open to trying Bachi burger out.  I have tried several of their burgers and I must say, all are good, though I have my favorites.  My favorite is the kiki burger.  I think most of their burgers at this restaurant tend to be on the sweet side.  Initially, I didn't like this burger much because of the sweetness, but when I put the aioli sauce on it, everything just came together.   The salty taste that I like came from the aioli sauce and just brought the flavoring and ingredients all together.  This burger is what I would recommend for everyone to try first.  It is not too far off the classic ingredients of a burger, I think.  Note, I'm not going to describe the burger toppings too much, as there are better reviewers before me that have described the specifics.  You can also look up the menu at bachi burgers' website 

The second burger on my list is the banh mi burger, which has a Vietnamese flare.  Again, their sauce just brings their fusion idea all together.  Yum Yum.  I would definitely pick this if I'm not up for the kiki burger that day.

The other burgers I've tried are the Kalbi burger and Mr. Ho's burger.  These burgers are fine.  All in all, I think it just depends on what kind of fusion burger you are in the mood for during that time.  If you are wanting something with a little Vietnamese taste, go with the Banh mi burger.  If you want a hint of Korean, go with the Kalbi burger.  

Others in my party have tried the American Wagyu burger and the Ronin burger.  They liked these as well. The buns on these burgers are soft and really good.  Also, I have tried the steamed sandwiches, such as the duck and pork belly sandwiches.  These are great.

Their sausage appetizers are pretty good.  We order this for our little one all the time.  Their fries are awesome too, especially the truffle fries.   

This place definitely has a good vibe and the waiters\/waitresses are friendly.  It does get busy at times, so you may want to get their by 1130 for lunch or arrive on earlier dinner times (6??).  

Whenever I have guests from out of town and are in the mood for burgers, I definitely recommend this place.  I do give them a heads up it takes a little while for the burgers to cook, so their expectations for a little wait are set.  The good thing is that they have TVs that you can watch while you wait, if you're not chatting with your friends.  It's always tuned to the cooking or food channel, so there's a chance you will get hungrier, while you wait.  It makes the food even better when it arrives and you take your first bites.  So far, I think everyone leaves satisfied and happy like I am."	5	Bachi Burger	4
"I was looking forward to finding and eating at this place based on the reviews I've red on yelp.  Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed.  I had a pepperoni and sausage pizza slice and another slice that had meatballs, sausage, green peppers, and olives.  The latter was recommended by one of the workers there.  The pepperoni and sausage pizza was ok.  The other slice didn't really have much taste.  I had an oily film-like taste on my tongue that I couldn't wash down with Coke, but went away after 45 minutes.  haha.

This place is designed to be like a small pizza joint with a couple TVs to watch sports.  They just had a few side tables with 5 barstools.  If it gets a little busy, you just have to find space and stand. 

The only cool thing about this place was that it was hidden and had an interesting time finding this place.  Note, it didn't take long after asking the concierge.  =)

As a local, it wasn't worth going to the Strip just to go to this place.  Factor in the Strip prices for food, I would not go back to this place, unfortunately. 

Grimaldi's is still the best in my opinion."	2	Secret Pizza	4
"Wazuzu serves up incredibly sexy, Asian-influenced cuisine that should not be missed when you're in Vegas.  Bright red walls encompass the cozy, open restaurant.  A giant crystal dragon watches over you as you debate which dishes you'll try this time.  And with that - the Hamachi Chili Sashimi was amazing.  Even the non-sushi eaters in our group loved it.  The Crunch Roll is a work of art that you want to frame rather than eat, but trust me, it's much too delicious just to look at.  The oversized Pork Potstickers with Ponzu Sauce are expertly seasoned and not greasy at all. 
For the main course - Drunken Noodles, Salt and Pepper Prawns and Thai Basil Chicken.  All three were equally impressive and the portion sizes were very generous.  The Prawns almost look as if they need a sauce, but after biting into them, you them so juicy that a sauce would only mask their true flavor.  The noodles on the other hand beg you to finish off the accompanying sauce that complements them justly.  The crisp red and green bell pepper adds a nice touch of color to the bowl.  Wazuzu is a MUST try for any foodie in Vegas."	5	Wazuzu	3.5
"The food was good and satisfying, but I woud not go again as my first choice.

Tab for 2: $65 + tip

Jellyfish appetizer: tasted like seaweed salad, but had a much thicker texture. Large portion, but not that tasty.

Duck entree: edible but gamy, thick layer of fat, lots of bones

Tony's chicken: tasty, spicy, lots of breading

Egg drop soup: bland

Lucky Dragon cocktail: just okay, it was $11

Service: wonderful service from Rachel she was attentive, enthusiastic and kind

Ambiance: amazing 

Worth a try, maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes. There was obvious skill that went into each dish, but I think I might just have different taste."	3	Lao Sze Chuan	3
"Chef Cory and Dan were just at a large Christmas event at axis theater and the food and service was absolutely
Amazing! The chopped brisket was delicious and the Mac and cheese was also amazing!!! We are from Kansas City where it's hard to beat the bbq there and this was just as good!!! We will definitely be going back for seconds!!"	5	Rollin Smoke Barbeque	4.5
"I've stayed here over the last 5 years I think and it's gone from being nice and sane in a world of madness, to just a touch shabby.

I used to love it because compared to the rubbish hotels in Vegas, this was a bit of an escape. Sanity. Calm. No big casino. No clubs etc. I love all that...but not in the hotel. The walk to the strip was short and you know, the beds were fantastic.

Now though, it's just completely been eclipsed. The Wynn, Cosmopolitan and all the other newer hotels just dazzle and shine and the poor old Westin is, as someone else said, like putting lipstick on a pig. 

The areas around it remain sketchy and undeveloped, the views are RUBBISH, the spa isn't great, the service is just ok, the TV (per the pics) is from the 80's I think... I come away thinking that I'm in the cheap seats and that's unfortunately not the truth either... at $180 + a stupid resort fee, it's a bit of a con.

And as a Starwood Platinum for many years....SPG you should know better. Please refresh and update or call it a pig."	2	Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa	3

"David CHANG's Greatest Hits!  Like the music artists who put out one of those compilations for big money but no creative sweat so Momofuku LV hits the strip food scene.  We have been to two of the NYC venues and rabid fans so we are a bit biased. 
Atmospherics are all LV hip.  You could drop any big name chef and change the sign in front and start rolling with evening service.  Thumpy uber soundtrack, cool interiors, hip staff and even more hipster floor overseers all make things work.  Our server was knowledgeable, energetic and bubbly.  They all worked seamlessly together and I counted 4 managers who made sure everything was cool.  One overseer dude passed our table every 8 minutes as he panned and scanned the room.   ""Leave no empty wine glass behind"" is their service motto.  Bravo. They got it down par excellence!
Food was also right up there with Mr. Chang's vision execution.   Hot hot, cold cold, crispy crispy.  The Bao's all yummy, especially liked the chicken karaage one. Super crisp and light.  He added a app sized fried chicken, Truffle creme and caviar for $48.  Three petite strips of super yummy chook goodness.  Easily the star of the starters.  Truffle Ramen was not smoking hot so a bit off for us.   I would make it a point to make sure the server expresses this out of the kitchen and you be prepared  to scarf it quick.  Minimize your food Porn shots and eat while the heat activates the truffles.  If you are a party of 4 or more there are some large format entrees like his rotisserie duck that are fabulous but you need to plan ahead and even order in advance.  The big winner entrees are here so go find some friends.  Bar and wine list back up the food to the same degree of thoughtfulness. 
Mr. Chang is known for being a eclectic culinary maestro with a irreverent look on life.  While what he really should be respected for is being leader of passionate abilities that has created a cadre of culinary and service professionals that deliver memorable dining experiences.  LV peach brings to the West Coast a bit of all his learnings executed by a core team of his tribe of peach peeps.   Actually 4.5 stars with the last .5 attainable once they find their own identity and peach edginess.    Long live the Peach!"	4	Momofuku Las Vegas	4
"Everything is bigger and better in Vegas right?   Well if you take the true spirit of an Izakaya (simple tasty dishes to make you drink more and relax) and amped it up 3 levels and tripled the price then Zumba fits right in.  
First atmospherics, the custom groove music playlist perfectly volume synced to the crowd buzz level? Check.  Ample service team running around supervised by aloof\/hipster floor managers? Yup.  High end dining room dark enough so you can't read the menu prices? That's the plan.  And most important a beehive of customers shelling out American moolah by the Ben Franklins. That's the whole idea.   I must say that besides good food and on point service, the most important part of creating a great dining experience is You!  And a lot more beautiful people like you!   The energy in a dining room comes from the customers who animate and fill the place with buzz.  That's the magic elusive ingredient that blends and masks everything to a smooth endorphin feeling meal.  Ok, so Zuma got all of that in spades. 
Food.   Above average sushi bar.  Once you got two choices for Toro (chuu and oo) you know they got the Chefs and suppliers from the A level to make almost everything.  Another markers is Japanese uni (Hokkaido) vs. the us west coast version.  Smaller darker gonads that are more sweeter and intense without the funkiness than their bigger American cousins.   So give the sushi bar a A-.  What's missing is 4-5 unique kinds of fish or shellfish.  They did have kimidai which is a kind of snapper and their scallops are from Hokkaido so they do get points. 
Kitchen does a great job with a wide and diverse menu.   Mixing Robata, tempura and hot dishes in with the usual high end starters.  As others have said, kind of riffs on Morimoto or Nobu signature dishes.  Nothing super new and I personally did not like the basil\/shiso flavoring of their creamier gratin dishes.  Miso Porkbelly skewers did stand out in my mind.  Also the giant grilled prawn a better choice than the lobster.  Another A-.   At this price and execution level you can't really go wrong with any dish.  
Bar. Now here they get a solid A!   Very creative and eclectic menu for cocktails.  Got to get the Burning History.  Kind of a Japanese whisky sour complete with torched MaCallan whisky stave.   And hand chipped clear ice to boot!  This was done well and at tableside for the ohhh factor.  Another one is the fish in the bag gin tonic presentation.  Winna!
So if you got some cash to burn it's better to waste it here than lose it on the first floor.   At least you will have a full tummy and a great fun memory.  All you get downstairs is regrets!"	5	Zuma Las Vegas	4.5
"After years of visiting Las Vegas, I've always heard raving reviews about this mysterious ""Secret Pizza"" inside of the Cosmo, but after finally tasting this pie for myself, I would not come back.

Not only is this place over-hyped, but its definitely overpriced.

I tried the sausage and pepperoni pizza. While it looked great with huge slices of meat spread across the pizza, it lacked major flavor."	2	Secret Pizza	4
Hard to miss with the bright blue storefront in a sea of bland beige. Restaurant was pretty empty on a Sunday evening but that made it easier for us to sit down immediately with a party of 13. Service was super friendly and prompt. Prices were a little higher than I expected but portions were good. Food was very tasty with highlights being the kalbi, bibimbap and BBQ pork belly. Great hidden option in LV if you're looking for decent, no-frills Korean food.	4	Garden Korean Restaurant	4
"I had no idea what to expect walking into this steak house, but I was so glad we decided to give them a try as we walked around the casino. The door greater and servers where really nice and everyone was smiling which is always a good sign.

The food took a while to come out the kitchen, and the prices where high but it was 100% worth it....... All of the food was freshly made and everything was cooked perfect (no cooking mistakes in L.V. is becoming rear). If you got visitors in town make it a point to take them to Mandalay.....and If you want them to eat very delicious food I recommend Strip Steak House!"	5	StripSteak	4
My goodness the food is soooo good here. My girlfriend and I where at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and he was on top of his job even though the restaurant was having a busy Saturday night with a full party going on in the back the drink orders never stopped but he made us feel very comfortable anyway. Then when the food came out it was cooked to perfection. I can't wait to go back I have been thinking about my next plate of Cuban food all week!!!!	5	Florida Cafe Cuban Bar & Grill	3.5
"VERY HAPPY DINNER.....

I took my family to DW. and we had a delicious meal, we all loved are meals and the restaurant was beautifully decorated my oldest was so impressed by the paintings on the walls she took a few pictures. I left a bit unsatisfied due to the food not being real Jamaican food it was in my opinion a cover band not the real thing. I had the oxtails plate with rice and peas, when the food came out it looked like Jamaican food but it didn't taste like it at all.....  very low on seasoning but a ok plate of food it was definitely not authentic in no other way than looks.  My parents our both Jamaican and I have visited 5 time so I know the real when I taste it...sorry this at it you mon."	4	DW Bistro	4.5

Had a horrible service from this location. I work within the mall so Cheesecake is the only real food place to get food. We have their menu in our store and we order all the time. I called 30 mins before my lunch to make sure my order was good to go as always, I placed an order of Fried Calamari, good to go. I went over there on my lunch to pick it up and there was nothing. No sign of my order being there. I couldn't have called the wrong location because it's the only phone number we have of them and we call it all the time. The staff and managers seem to be clueless and not even the slightest apologetic of my inconvenience. So I still paid and tried to wait for my food but still took almost 20 minutes where the at the time did not seem to be busy at all. They said that it was coming right up and I waited it was almost time for me to clock back in when I got my food to go and it looked really half assed. The amount of food I got was about half of what I would usually get and they had a soggy piece of napkin underneath the food. It was not fresh, it was not even remotely warm. I was not happy with the experience and staff did not try to do much to help out the situation.	1	The Cheesecake Factory	3

"Came here for hubby to try his very first Beef Wellington and Gordon Ramsay Steak did not disappoint.

I first came here with my sister a few years back and was so in love with this place this was our destination place to celebrate my anniversary.

The one thing I have to say - is even though it's been a few years - it was exactly how I remembered it and worth at least experiencing once for sure!

Gordon Ramsay Steak is located in Paris - and reservations are definitely a must!! We got a booth upstairs which was nice because it blocked out noise and it was very cozy and comfy...

And then our waitress came to show us the different types of meats they offer and share a bit about tenderness, location of cut, etc. Very interesting! 

We ordered our own Beef Wellington which now as I think back was a mistake - we should've shared because we were SO STUFFED!!  With the delicious breads - they didn't have a lot of variety but the three they offered was AWESOME - the olive bread was our favorite but they also had a focaccio, and some cheesy roll... served with sweet cream salted butter... so hard not to dive into the bread while waiting for the beef wellingtons....

For sides we ordered the Brussels Sprouts that was cooked perfectly with fried shallots and prosciutto, along with their fingerling potatoes with truffle and Parmesan! EXCELLENT and PERFECT sides!

And the Beef Wellington?  Well it was SO delicious!! With the pastry, the tender filet - with the flavors bursting out... sigh.  I've seen on Top Chef Junior - the KIDS made this - flavored with mustard and mushrooms... the technique of searing the meat and then baking with the phyllo... and i'm sure my memory is still missed some steps but it's not easy - and it tasted so tender and flavorful!! Loved it!!

And of course - we HAD to order their sticky toffee pudding cake with butter ice cream!!  We ended up eating half and all the butter ice cream and bringing back the other half of the sticky toffee pudding cake and ate it a few days later - and it was JUST as perfect! DROOL!!!  

Great service, excellent cozy environment - and a wonderful food dining experience to at least try once in a lifetime!!"	4	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
"OMG - I watch a lot of cooking shows - Top Chef, Top Chef Masters, etc... and I always wonder how some of those dishes would taste!

Well, we splurged and L'Atelier is now one of my FAVORITE and MUST GO to places EVER!!

I was a bit surprised to be seated at the counter and realized that we had full view of the chef and all the action!  Saw the chef whipping up the most decadent potatoes! OMG - the work they put into it is definitely reflected in the dish!!

Hubby and I each got Menu A - which is the Amuse-Bouche, 3 menu choices and 1 dessert selection.  We figured that allowed us to taste at least 8 different little dishes!  It was AWESOME!!  First we started with the Amuse-Bouche - which was foie gras served in a little cup with this delicious foam on top.  If I could I would've licked the inside of the little cup but I didn't want to seem vulgar or rude... so tempted though....

Hubby had the octopus carpaccio and I have to say - this was done perfectly! seasoned perfectly - tender... delicate! amazing!  I had the yellowtail served as a ravioli, with sea urchin and osetra caviar! I still remember the taste, the creamy texture... indescribable - SO mind blowing! 

Hubby then went for the veggies - Seasonal vegetables medley with Spanish virgin olive oil and I have to say - it was delicious!! so fresh and refreshing! Glad one of us is a healthier eater.  I on the other hand had their seared duck foie gras that came with a poached pear with toasted pistachios on top!  Eating it together was like absolute heaven - perfectly balanced - decadent... UGH so GOOD!

Hubby then had the Le Boeuf which was the casserole braised beef cheeks with red wine sauce.  They brought it out in a little casserole dish and plated in front of us - pouring the sauce on top - that was the BEST beef cheeks EVER!! So tender, flavorful! AWESOME!!  My next choice was the beef and foie gras burger with frittes! OMG so absolutely decadent.  Two little burgers with perfectly seared pieces of foie gras with the most soft and toasted little buns ever!!  with my little side of ""frittes""...  I loved that it wasn't a lot but just the right amount!! this tasting menu thing is PERFECT!! If my tummy could do it I'd get the full tasting but I didn't think I could do it!  Our neighbor at the counter next to us - who's a regular was this wonderful articulate woman ""Angelica"" who shared a piece of one of her dishes - it was a thinly sliced piece of raw beef - OMG - SO AWESOME!!!

And then we ended our meal with dessert - hubby had the ""carrot cake""... yeah right - it was a little carrot cake that LOOKED LIKE a CARROT! it was a delicious piece of art!!  And it came with a coconut sobet!  I will definitely post a picture.  I had the Les Tartes - So I asked - what tarts do you have - response - ""oh you get a little piece of all""! The first was their recreation of a snickers bar! (way better than snickers of course), then their lemon meringue (not too tart, not too sweet and very light!), apple crisp (flaky crust with delicious apple), passion fruit tart (AWESOME) and a pear and apple tart! SO delicious - light and flavorful with light crust! Perfect little bites of perfect tarts!! 

And of course we had drinks - LOVED their blueberry pom with ginger beer - hubby had a great drink as well - unfortunately can't remember the name but I will say our new ""friend"" had quite a few different drinks - was so tempted ...

LOVE this place and will definitely come here EVERYTIME we come to Vegas!!  Definitely recommend reservations and sitting at the counter is a great experience. I was amazed at the the fact that the whole kitchen had to speak and understand french - as the expediter was giving instructions all in french! What an AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!"	5	L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon	4.5
"Got to try this place because while in Vegas - we met up with family and they recommended this place to meet up and I am SO GLAD they did!

I had their Brio Sliced Steak Salad - This was SO GOOD and I LOVED it.  The salad had tender slices of steak with a chopped salad that had a delicious balsamic dressing along with tomatoes, gargonzola, mushrooms, spicy pecans and I think there was a bit of creamy horseradish that gave it that perfect BITE with the steak!! Wish they had this dish at home! 

We also had the special which was the Seared Scallops with Risotto - I think my hubby pretty much inhaled this dish and the plate licked clean!  Other family members had the Lobster and Risotto!  The TAIL was HUGE - they LOVED it and each of the risottos were paired with wine which went perfectly with each of the dishes!

We were so stuffed we couldn't eat dessert but i have to tell you - the food, service, atmosphere was PERFECT! We sat around and enjoyed our meal and company with water glasses getting filled and just great service all around.

I actually wish we had a Brio Tuscan Grille in the bay area but at least now we know a go to place when in Vegas!!"	4	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
"Mesa Grill is AWESOME - especially for brunch.  Tried Mesa Grill years ago with my girlfriends and had to bring hubby here and he's so happy we came here on our trip...

They started us off with their ""bread basket"" which had a variety of breads.  While I know we should have saved room for our brunch, we ended up eating the whole bread basket and had more!!!  Our favorite was the scones and coffee cake.. Was hard NOT to eat these!  And the server was SO NICE to provide us with only our favorites the 2nd go around!! YUM....

We then got Bobby Flay's specialty, The prawns over a homemade corn tamale! LOVED it - we pretty much licked the plate clean!  If you get a chance - go on their website - they show how they make it and it's a MUST order when you come here...

I also got their apple salad which because of it's simplicity was so tasty!  That dressing was perfect with the salad - can't recall what it was other than we basically inhaled the entire salad.  And I enjoyed it with my prickly pear tea! They gave me simple syrup so I can add the right amount of sweetness! Loved it!!

Hubby had their sweet potato hash and LOVED it.  Cooked perfectly - but because we ate so much bread - he could only eat one, so we brought the other back to our timeshare which luckily had a kitchen so we could heat it up and devour the next day and it was JUST as yummy!

I had Egg over Taquillas.  Who knew such a simple dish could be SO GOOD! The egg was so light and fluffy - on top of cheese and they smeared a little seasoned black bean paste between the toasted crispy taquillas. Flavors and textures partying in my mouth!! I'm drooling now just thinking about this dish!  So simple and so delicious!

We were SO STUFFED - we definitely felt like we had to roll out of there - thank goodness in Vegas it's all about walking!  And the server was so nice - they gave me a ""to go"" cup for my prickly pear tea and topped it for me so I got to sip it as we walked around Vegas.  The servers are so personable and attentive - it was a nice welcoming feeling...  Will definitely come back - and maybe try lunch or dinner next time! 

Thank you Bobby Flay!!  You definitely are the best when it comes to southwest cuisine!!"	5	Mesa Grill	4
I had gone in with a friend of mine for lunch a few days ago. The food was okay like any other reviewer would inform you of, but I felt very very uncomfortable as we were the only two in there and they would stare at us relentlessly, it was at a point in which we decided to eat in the tables outside of the building rather than inside.	3	Flame Kabob	3.5
My family and I have been coming here for 10+ years and this was our favorite buffet to come to. We came to this buffet today and this will be the last time we ever come back. We are so angry and disappointed at what this buffet has become. It is not worth paying for anymore... I would not recommend this buffet at all	1	Carnival World & Seafood Buffet	2.5

"Wow its expensive here ! 

I think one fish cost us like 400dollars.. but maybe that was our fault for not asking how much the fish was per pound.

Loved their ribeye& octopus appetizer though !
Super juicy and cooked perfectly.

Don't think I can ever afford to come here again and even if I became super rich, I don't know if I'd pay 400 again for some fish. We'll..see.."	3	Estiatorio Milos	4
yum! mario batalli you have done it again! Its not del posto... not even close. But it is well priced quality italian food inside a venice italian moonlit\/sunlit\/ cloudy painted michealangelo sky. You sit outside like any italian piazza cafe and you can watch the plays and shows happening in the ventian plaza while you eat. They have great cocktails and food is really good for the casual comfortable spot that it is!	4	Enoteca San Marco	3.5
"SO GOOD! You gotta try this place. You will not be disappointed!! The meat is good, the sides are good, and even the soup was excellent. Mama knows best; mama's from korea; mama was loving this place. You will too.

my minus one star is because they didn't have any yangyum pah (the seasoned and mixed green onion stuff). at a buffet that had everything else that i wanted, i was really disappointed that they were missing this."	4	Sura BBQ Buffet	3.5
Management has changed and over the last couple of months it has become A-mazing!! Service is super nice and it actually looks cleaner than it used to be, it takes less than 15 minutes to make a pizza out of scratch and wings only take 10 minutes, there's also pasta, dessert, and drinks. It has a great family friendly feel and it feels a lot like a restuarant!	5	Pizza Hut	2
"I think that I didn't have the experience I should have had - if I were in NYC. I've never been to S3 in NYC but I imagine that its less Disneyland-ish with long lines and expensive drinks that taste bad. 

Next time I'm in NYC I'll try the real deal."	2	Serendipity 3	3
"I can't believe I finally found a decent brunch place in Last Vegas!

Essential elements for a decent brunch in Las Vegas:

1. Open late. Check.
2. Serves brunch late. Check.
3. Biscuits and gravy. CHECK.
4. Variety. Check.

This place exceeded my expectations and I was super impressed by the offerings. I will definitely be back. Worth the wait!"	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
Great vibe inside or out on the very welcoming patio...and the most decadent Mocha Spice Latte ever! Husby chilled over an Iced Creme Brulee Latte while we shared the scrumptious vegan brownie, so moist and delicious. Friendly, fast, well-priced service. We will be back;))	4	Sunrise Coffee	4.5
I am a Las Vegas local, and this is personally one of my favorite places for any meal of the day, especially if you get a table on the outside patio! It is directly across the street from the Bellagio fountains, which is such an amazing bonus to get to see while you eat. I've also always had amazing service ever time I go there. The last time I went Kate and Jose provided my boyfriend and I with exceptional service! We had the seafood platter and the lamb, and the lamb was absolutely out of this world! I highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi for an enjoyable and memorable Las Vegas Dining experience!	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"Good food, friendly service, and a great craft beer selection.

But FUCK, only when I travel to Nevada do I get reminded how cigarette smoke in a bar\/restaurant is just fucking ridiculously annoying and disgusting.  

Walking in to this place, it's like walking into a cave...a really dark cave filled with the stench of thousands of smoked\/currently being smoked cigarettes.  They probably keep the lighting dim to hide the catchers mitt  faces of the smokers who congregate around the bar.  Too bad that this is my biggest memory of this place, because they serve a mean burger with great tasting meat, toppings, and soft homemade bun.  They also have a really great beer selection, with many crafts to choose from on both tap and in a bottle.  And the service is great, with friendly bartenders who aren't bad on the eyes (at least from what I could see in the darkness).

Overall, if you have to be in Henderson NV like I was for work, then this isn't a bad spot that you can walk to from the Hampton Inn across the street and a block down or so.  And in all fairness, all of the little bar\/restaurants like this in the area are full of the smokers looking for an acceptable place to go so they can smokes while they eats, which is what they likes to do.

Would be four stars plus if not for the stench."	3	Fireside Restaurant & Tavern	3.5
"HORRIBLE service. The hostess was rude when my friend and I walked up to get seated. She just stared at us for 10 seconds and then asked ""can I help you?"". Um, yeah. Seat us. Once we sat down our waitress came over fairly quickly but it was all down hill from there. It took forever to get our order taken, when we asked for chips and salsa the waitress looked at me like I was asking for a pony wearing a crown. 

We ordered the steak nachos, no pico and sour cream on the side. When the nachos arrived there was no sour cream, no plates and no silverware. When we got the waitresses attention to let her know the sour cream was missing she looked around the table like we were HIDING it asking ""oh you didn't get it?"". Seriously? 20 minutes later we got all the aforementioned items but it was too late to salvage any part of this dining experience. 

The nachos was mediocre at best. Service was horrible. Unless you are starving, go somewhere else."	1	Chayo Mexican Kitchen + Tequila Bar	3
I am a Las Vegas local, and just had lunch at Lago at the Bellagio hotel for the first time this past weekend. All I can say is that I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY by this place! The view, the food, and the service were all top notch in my opinion! The outside patio isn't very big, so I am assuming there might be a bit of a wait in the evenings, but I can assure you it would absolutely be worth it for the view that you will get of the fountains while you eat! Monique was my server, and I could not have been any more impressed by how knowledgable she was of the menu. She was also super sweet and personable and provided top quality service. Even Gerti, the assistant manager, came over to see how everything was going. That was very classy in my opinion. And he was also extremely friendly and personable. It's safe to say I have a new favorite dining place here in Vegas, and am looking forward to taking my mom here when she comes to visit next week.	5	Lago	4
"The food here is pretty good but not the greatest Indian food I have ever had. It has a nice lunch buffet setup if you are new to these dishes and want a sampling of most common dishes. 

I suppose for a buffet you cannot expect much for service, but at the same time there is not a whole lot you need them to do... Drink orders, clear plates, extra napkins. I agree with other posts that service here is not stellar. 

The seating here is very tight. If coming with a party larger than 4, recommend a reservation. We came today with 4 adults and 2 small kids and were crammed into a small corner booth. Granted it was at the height of the buffet hours. Would have been manageable if our waiter was more attentive to clearing plates off the small table. 

Today just reminded me why I like India Palace much better."	3	Mint Indian Bistro	4
"So excited to have a ramen place in the NW. We have been back a few times. 

Pros: good portion sizes, friendly service, great tasting ramen, clean interior, cool that they have outlets to charge your phone 

Cons: prices are a little steep, no options for kids' portions or pricing, no delivery yet

All in all, a good experience at this place and a nice option for ramen if we don't feel like heading to Chinatown."	4	Ichi Ramen House	4
"We came here for lunch as a family with young kids the other day based on the recommendation of some friends that this is a fun place for the children. Seemed a little odd to me, but hey, why not?

Parking is available via the Flamingo Hotel and Vegas locals can still park for free for 24 hours. Yay!  It's a bit of a walk to the restaurant, through the casino from the parking garage to Margaritaville. 

We were able to be seated pretty quickly since the restaurant wasn't too busy for the lunch service. Our server was Susanna. She came by and plopped some menus on the table. Literally, a few minutes later, she came back and asked if we had drink orders ready. Since we barely had time to pick up the menu to look at it, we asked that she come back in a few. She walked away for one minute and then came right back. So we rushed to give her some drink orders. 

As we sat there trying to check out the kids menu and the regular menu, she appears again. This time she seemed rush to take our food order. If you have young kids, you know it requires a bit of patience to get everyone situated. Most of the party had decided on what to eat, but my young daughter still hadn't. So we started giving her the orders. Susanna seemed like we were wasting her time because she had to pause for 30 seconds while my daughter finally came to a decision. I'm not really sure why there was such a rush when the whole place wasn't that busy. But we were made to feel like we were inconveniencing her. Needless to say, our service experience was pretty crappy. Even after having a chat with the manager, not much changed.

There is not separate menu for lunch, which means the prices amount to the high Strip prices for dinner. At least there is a kids menu. An entree will run you from $15-20. 

The food really wasn't that fabulous for the prices. Pretty average. We had the crab\/artichoke dip which was tasty. Fish and chips were average. Jr. Cheeseburger pretty large for a kid. Crab cakes tasted like they were frozen and pretty mushy. 

If anything, you're paying for the atmosphere of this place. It looked like there was a large stage in the dining area for live music, which was not utilized during the lunch service. The music is playing so loud inside the restaurant that it's hard to have a conversation with anyone at your table. 

So if you're looking for a place to drink cocktails and party, this might be a better fit. If you're looking for a good meal, this probably isn't the place, at least based on our experience."	2	Margaritaville	3.5
"Came here with the family. We were seated fairly quickly, but the lines can get longer in the busy dinner rush.

Service was great. A bit loud from music inside. 

Had the street tacos- only 4 small ones, more like an appetizer. Super yummy.

Kids shared a bacon mac n cheese burger which was huge and delicious. 

Definitely try the Trashcan nachos. Great presentation and really packed with flavor. 

We all shared the mint chocolate chip oreo pie. Also huge but tasty and sweet. 

Overall, loved the place and not too shabby for the kids."	4	Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar	3.5
"We wanted to get some Indian food but did not feel like trekking out to the center of town so we came here. This was not our first time here, but this trip was excellent. 

The service was on point! Very attentive without being overbearing. Well-timed refills on water glasses. Most of all, sincere friendly attitudes from everyone there.

The food was great. Perfect size on portions. Great flavor. We ordered butter chicken, chicken korma, and Chana masala. Also gotta have garlic naan. The sweet lassi was delicious, one of the best in town because it was thick and not watered down. Only negative was the pistachio kulfi for dessert was a little too icy, but still yummy.

We had a great experience here and definitely recommend this place."	5	Saffron Flavors of India	4
As a Cali native, I was so excited for thislocation to open in Summerlin. This restaurant is a great addition to the area. Service is great. Food is just as you would expect from CPK. My faves are the italian chopped salad. The half portion is a meal in it of itself. My favorite pizza is the bbq chicken...mmm. Also very kid-friendly place.	5	California Pizza Kitchen	3.5
"Love the food here. Pretty authentic and they serve all the things I like to get when out for dim sum. 

Service remains true to most dim sum places.., you need to be aggressive and shout out what you want to get attention. The waiters do not check on you unless you speak up. Today we came late, around 2pm. Only two carts circling. Basically had to order what we wanted but had trouble finding our waiter to do so. No refilling our water glasses. So they lose a star for service today. 

The food was still good and satisfying."	4	Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine	3.5
When this place opened in the neighborhood, I was so excited to have a different breakfast spot nearby. Then we tried it. I was less than impressed. You order at the counter but go wait at the table for your food to be delivered. They serve it on paper plates with plastic utensils. If the waffles are crispy, this is tough to use with ease. The waffles were ok with plenty of options for toppings. They also serve boba drinks which is a huge plus in this part of town. They are on the right track, but for the price point, it needs to step up the presentation a bit.	3	Waffles Cafe	4
I love this place. Every item on the menu is divine. They have a great selection of wines. The pasta is homemade and you can taste the difference. They always have a good set of specials to choose from. Tonight I chose the grilled pork chop which was hearty and perfectly moist. Definitely try the baked Brie appetizer which is served with apples baguettes and filled with gooey cheese and carmelized onions. The ambience is wonderful, could be pretty romantic if that's what you are looking for. I usually go in a group and they have always accommodated my party with excellent service. Make sure to save room for dessert because they have a huge selection.	5	Grape Street	3.5
"Tried this place for our first time after a friend recommended it. We had an awesome experience. Tried the Artesian meat and cheese platter. Excellent. Had the beet salad which was good but a little more salad than beets. It was huge too. Next I had the tagliatelle with bolognese sauce which was delicious. The pasta was fresh and homemade and you could taste the difference in a positive way. My hubby had the filet with gorgonzola sauce and the meat was cooked to perfection and very tender. Did not even need a steak knife to slice it. Had the tiramisu for dessert. The portion was perfect and very yummy. 

In addition, the service was excellent and the owner took the time to go around speaking to each table. Very nice touch. 

Ambience was semi-casual, kinda romantic place with the mood lighting. Nice wine selection too. 

We will definitely be coming back in the future."	5	Mezzo Bistro and Wine	4
"Stopped here to see if this could be a decent dim sum place in Summerlin. They have indoor and outdoor seating options. The food was above average. They have one cart rolling around with a few dim sum options. We also ordered a few dishes from the main menu. Good size portions, enough to share family style. Disappointed that our potstickers came to the table cold in the middle. The chef should probably be more careful not to serve rare pork! That really ruined it for us, especially since it took so long to get that item to the table (they served it last at the end of meal). 

Also the place did not seem too set up for young kids. All breakable plates and glasses were given to my toddlers. Given the family setting of Downtown Summerlin, you would think they would cater to the clientele better."	3	Rice Republic	3
"A quaint little cafe in the area. Service was excellent. Super friendly and helpful waitress. 

We had the Cubano sandwich, grilled steak tacos and kids pizzas. Also started with the spinach dip with pita. The dip was the best I have had in a long time. Even my kids ate it despite the spinach! 

The pizza was awesome with good quality cheese spread heavily over it. 

The tacos had so much flavor that I demolished the dish. 

The Cubano didn't disappoint. 

Definitely recommend trying this hidden gem."	5	Hunt & Gather Cafe	4
Good breakfast food. Was so excited to get a breakfast place in our neighborhood and was happy this place had more seating than the other location. We typically do our family breakfast thing on the weekend which is always packed so we started doing our orders to go. Worked great until they stopped taking takeout orders until after 12pm! Completely ridiculous that a restaurant which is only breakfast fare would limit their hours like that. I have small kids so it is difficult to take them to crowded places and wait 30 minutes for food. Guess we will just have to take our business to Mimi's Cafe who hires enough staff to handle their rush periods.	2	Babystacks Cafe	4
My favorite Persian restaurant in Las Vegas! The food is delicious with good size portions. The service is excellent and attentive. Habib himself is often on site and he is such a nice man. My favorite dish is called Fesenjan, a chicken stew in a walnut pomegranate sauce. It is delicious here. To add a special touch to the experience, they give each lady a long-stemmed red rose. Would definitely be a great place to bring a date if you were trying to butter her up. I highly recommend this place!	5	Habib's Persian Cuisine	3.5
"Typical Chuck E Cheese experience. We came for a birthday party and this time was a pleasant experience because there were only 3 parties for our time slot. This particular location is probably the nicest one in town due to its size and play area. 

The staff here is young and barely helpful. While I appreciate the high security to go in and out of the place with a stamp to verify that the adult and child ""belong"" to each other, I shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes to exit because the person who is working the exit is also working the Dippin Dots station. I find this place never has enough staff to adequately help customers. So don't expect much from them. 

And the food is mediocre at best. But the prices are equal to restaurants in town. 

Very grateful that there are other options in town for a similar experience e.g. John's or Dave & Buster's"	2	Chuck E. Cheese's	2.5
One of the best steak places in town. So juicy that you do not need steak sauce. Good portions as well. Decor is nothing modern or fancy. It is quite rustic. Cheese bread is addicting. Service is hit or miss which is why they lose a star. But the food is pretty amazing for a place hidden away in the northwest.	4	Bob Taylor's Ranch House	3.5
"Love coming here with the family. Great American comfort food with hearty portions. This place is not fancy at all but I find the ambience casual and welcoming. Servers are very helpful and attentive. This place has a nice selection of meat dishes, fish, and steaks. 

Our family seems to love this place for those nights when you don't feel like cooking but you don't want to break the bank eating out. A great little find in the Centennial Hills area without the boring franchise feel."	4	Montana Meat Company	3.5
This has become our favorite place to take the family for dinner. The service is stellar. I can't remember where else we have gone where the servers are so attentive to every little need. The food is delicious! Our favorites are the parmesan crusted pork and the house special sirloin. The salad bar is not your typical one, but we love the options there, especially the pepper crusted bacon. We haven't had one bad experience at this place and always love coming to Downtown Summerlin. Keep up the good work.	5	Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse	4
"Tried this place for the first time recently with the whole family. Service was pleasant, friendly, and quick. The place was a little noisy indoors. They do have a nice patio which you can bring your pet to. 

The food selection was average, but the taste and flavors were pretty good. 

We shared the Smores dessert at the end which was delicious."	4	Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar	4
Came here due to a recommendation by a friend. Our experience was amazing. I did not think we would fill up on bits put together but we were all stuffed by the end. We chose one of the meat platters to sample a few different things for the first time. Great drink selection. Excellent way to hang out with friends. Servers were excellent and attentive. Will definitely be back.	5	Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ	4
Came here for a business lunch. Sushi was tasty and fresh, but it was nothing out of the norm for Vegas sushi places. It was definitely some place I would come back to though. Service was friendly but I did feel a little rushed by them. Ambience inside was clean and on the trendy side. The style kept with the feel of Tivoli Village. All in all, a nice experience.	4	Kabuki Japanese Restaurant	4
This was not our first time here but we have not been in a long time so we chose this for a much needed date night. Our waiter was great. He did not hesitate to strike up conversation with us while he mixed our fondue together. Very attentive in checking on us for everything. The food was yummy. This place involves a little work on your part but that is the fun of the experience. We had a great time and look forward to coming back again soon.	5	The Melting Pot - Las Vegas	4
The food itself is good. Fun names to their specialty rolls. Service is ok. Ambience aims to be more on the hip side which is not quite my taste but tolerable. Not very family friendly but more suited for groups of friends or adults only. But at the end of they day, yummy sushi so will return in the future.	3	Sushi Loca	3.5
"Checked out this place for a Sunday dinner service. Family of 4 including 2 young kids. The ambience is average and the place is a little more than average noise level. 

After being seated, a server came over to ask for drink orders. When I paused to breathe, she took that as taking too long and walked away. This actually happened a second time as I was asking my kids what they wanted and that took too long for her. On her third arrival at the table, I literally had to ask her to give us 30 seconds to answer her questions before she walks away again. 

So we ordered 2 kids meals and 2 AYCE. The server  was at least helpful in explaining how their AYCE works e.g. which items were excluded or limited to one. 

I found it a little off-putting to have her emphasize to us the kids can't share our food. This was as they were dropping food off to the table and the kids meals still waiting to be done. I totally get that a business doesn't want to have people abuse the AYCE rules, but I highly doubt 2 little kids are going to eat them into bankruptcy. 

Then I ordered one thing only to have the wrong item brought to the table. When it was mentioned to the server, he shrugged his shoulders and left it on the table anyway. 

When asked to speak with a manager, surprisingly none on site! Can't say that I didn't see that one coming. 

It's a shame because the food is good and there is a decent selection. They do seem to err on more spicy oriented special rolls. Which is how they got a second star from me. 

Definitely not very family friendly in my opinion. So won't be back. I recommend you save yourself a bad experience like we had and it spoiled a nice time out with my family."	2	Sushi Bomb	4
This was our first time at this restaurant and I wanted so much to love it. We had a 6pm reservation and were seated promptly upon arrival. The hostess was friendly and our server George was helpful. We were presented with a list of specials which included Swordfish and pumpkin ravioli. For appetizers we tried the Ahi Tuna Sashimi and the Bang Bang Shrimp. The tuna was good but not spectacular. The shrimp had a good flavor. Portions were pretty big for an appetizer. Would have been better if we shared one. I had the wedge salad which was okay, but again just an average salad. My hubby had a cup of corn chowder with lump crab meat which was tasty and a generous portion for a cup. I decided on ordering the swordfish but was told they were out of pumpkin ravioli. I was quite disappointed by this. It was early in the night to be out of something on your specials list. Poor management of inventory if you ask me. So I ordered it with the suggested mushroom ravioli. My hubby got the Chilean sea bass with mango salsa. Both of our entrees were disappointing. The mushroom ravioli was not tasty at all. Both fish dishes were flavorless. I was surprised that a place that specializes in seafood does not know how to infuse flavor into the fish. They merely just top it with stuff. I was not impressed at all by the food here. I will say that the service was good and ambience nice for a night out, but it does not make up for the poor food.	3	Bonefish Grill	3.5
Came here for a private kids birthday party. Have been wanting to try this out for awhile. Awesome experience. You get to try and paint a selected painting while drinking some wine and chowing with friends. An instructor demonstrates how to recreate the painting and you get to take your creation home.  Not sure I would recommend this for little kids as it was quite messy, but the kids did have fun. I would definitely return with a group of adults though.	5	Design & Dine	4.5
"On our quest to find a dim sum place closer to home, we decided to check this place out. As previous posts stated, there are no carts and you order directly from a menu. This just means the food comes out piping hot and fresh. The selection of dim sum was excellent, at least for the items I usually order. The service was average, but they get kudos for being attentive.  The food was delicious. Prices are a little higher than our usual dum sum place.

The only criticism was there were two items we ordered that they ran out of. It is a major pet peeve of mine when you have regular menu items out of stock, it implies someone is not doing their job at inventory when you are out of multiple items. One is understandable, but three?

Overall, a good experience and we will probably be back again."	4	Dim Sum Cafe	4
"Such a great neighborhood breakfast spot. The place is not huge, but a cozy place. 

We walked in with one waiter serving the whole place and few other tables filled up right behind us. I give the guy major props because he handled the situation like a pro. He was very gracious and got us taken care of well.

The kids had the chocolate chip pancakes. My hubby had the bacon egg sandwich. I ordered the Throwback. My MIL had the plain French toast. We all loved our chosen dishes. 

We will definitely come back. I really wanna try their Benedict options. I am thrilled to find a new breakfast spot different from the franchise places."	5	Divine Eatery	4
Went for the lunch buffet. Nice selection of dishes. Tasty food. Service was good. Mango lassi was delicious and a great portion compared to a lot of places. Would definitely come back.	4	India Masala Bar & Grill	4
This particular location has a lot of problems getting your order right. I know running a drive thru is really complicated, but does anyone teach their employees to check the bag before serving the customers? Even complaints to management do not improve things. Also, be careful if your order is for more than one person per car. Then they really get confused here!	2	McDonald's	2.5
Great place for breakfast! Family friendly and great service. Yummy hollandaise sauce on my benedict.	5	Omelet House Summerlin	4
Like other reviews, I am just glad to have a decent pho place in this part of town. The service was okay. The food was just ok. The broth was not quite flavorful enough but it was acceptable. They have a good selection of items. I wanted to love the place but it just does not quite measure up to other places near Spring Mountain.	3	Pho Rancho	3.5
"We are always down to try a new sushi place. We dropped in here on a weekday for a late lunch. We were one of 2 tables in the place.

From the beginning, it was a lackluster experience. Table for four, including 2 kids. We were seated and not given any menus for over 5 minutes. Any mother knows with little ones, service must be efficient as kids do not tolerate long waiting times. The waitress dropped off the menus and ran off. She came back and wanted our food order. When we told her we were still thinking, she immediately ran off without even giving me a breath to tell her our drink order.  She brought our drinks but forgot one. We gave her our food order and sat. We ordered a veggie tempura appetizer. That came to the table. It was a big platter of tempura but accompanied by the most tasteless dipping sauce. Plus, they only serve it with the tiniest amount considering the dish it was paired with. I also ordered a cucumber salad but never received it so I cannot comment on what it tasted like.  Next we ordered 2 chicken ramen noodles for the entrees. Those arrived and were huge. The broth had no flavor and the chicken was cold. It had clearly just been sliced up and thrown in. It too had no flavor. I thought it would be grilled or marinated or something. Definitely not worth the $9 price, even Top Ramen tastes better. My kids had a veggie noodle dish. I give her credit for getting that out to us quickly, but she did not give them any utensils.

Bottom line, horrible service with nothing to excuse it e.g being busy or understaffed. And blah food. 

Next time we will stick with our usual sushi joint down the road."	2	Red Ginseng Narita Sushi & BBQ	3
"The pasta here is awesome. Very cool and simple concept- pick your pasta then pick your sauce. Portions are generous. I chose the butternut squash ravioli with carbonara sauce and I practically licked my plate. Meatball sub was huge. Kids Mac and cheese was delicious. Hubby had lobster ravioli with pink vodka sauce and was pleased.

Only downside was the decor was not up to scale with their prices. Each plate is about $15-20. 

Service was very good. Friendly and courteous staff. 

Will definitely be back"	4	Pastaidea	4.5
One of few places open at 5am. The crew is always friendly and cheery. Greet you with a smile which I need when I am up that early. They always serve me quickly which is necessary when I am rushing to work. Of course, the bagels and shmears are yummy. Love their to go boxes which makes it easy to take my goods and run. Love this place.	5	Einstein Bros Bagels	3.5
"This place used to be awesome. Met our friends from out of town at this place and was shocked how the quality has gone DOWN. The portion sizes are pitiful now. Food still tastes okay but I never thought it was that amazing compared to any other Thai restaurants in town. 

I was also taken aback when we made our reservation and they said that if we were more than 5 minutes late, they would cancel it! FIVE MINUTES!?!?! The standard in restaurant industry is 15. We had a large party as well and people were arriving separately. I guess they don't want to encourage locals to come here. 

I think it's time to find a new Thai restaurant to recommend to my friends who are visiting Vegas."	3	Lotus of Siam	4
"Finally got to dine at this restaurant after years of hearing good things. I wish we didn't wait so long to try it out! 

I loved everything about our experience...the food, the ambiance, the service. 

The food was spectacular. You can taste the care put into every dish that is served. Excellent flavors, good quality proteins, fresh homemade pasta. The bread is made fresh daily and it tastes as such. 

Our server, Donny, was very attentive and gracious to go over his recommendations in detail with great descriptions of how each item was prepared. 

We found it especially impressive that Chef Marc is going around to each and every table to greet customers and welcome everyone with genuine hospitality. What a dedicated owner! 

We really had a tough time choosing what to order because it all sounded delicious. But even better, every item we ordered was fantastic! 

We will definitely be back again!"	5	Chef Marc's Trattoria	4.5
This was my first experience with Ethiopian cuisine and I was not disappointed. We had the Kitfo and the tibs. Both excellent. The owner was very attentive and even brought us some extra injera after I was raving about how much I loved it. He also told us their special vegetarian dish, that is only available on Wednesday nights, is very popular.. so you can bet I'll be heading back to try it out.	5	Cafe Luhena	5
"Okay so I have been to myriads of hookah lounges, and this one is just not what I expected. I have been here three times and it's kind of the same every time. SADLY, the cons weigh over the pros by far. 

THE PROS: The inside is very nice and modern with colored lights and a Dj booth. They have a dance floor which is always fun. They have local DJs play and that is always nice as well. The music itself ranges from rap to EDM. 

They offer food also ( I haven't tried anything so I can't comment on the restaurant aspect of this business). They have very keen security, so you will feel safe and not like you're in a ghetto hookah lounge to get shot or mugged in. They check ID immediately so you know they are serious and not trying to just get money from minors.

Another plus, it is always clean and well kept from what I have seen so far. They are always very courteous and say welcome as they have a door man open the door for you. The staff is never rude, but they are very firm. There is no horse play in this lounge for sure.


THE CONS: I have come here to meet with a large party one time, and only to find that their seating is WHACK. You cannot merge a 4 top table with another table, you cannot move chairs to seat more people at the 4 top table, and do not try to even justify it because you are wasting your breath. It is supposedly a safety\/fire hazard. So with a large party, you have to sit awkwardly with someone in the middle gap of the two tables and try to have a good time from an uncomfortable distance. 

On top of this awkwardness, the tables are high like a restaurant normally would have. This means these two feet tall hookahs are literally sitting there like annoying table centerpieces that you have to keep looking around just to talk to your friends. 

Their customer service is very strange and rushed. For example: They will take your refill bowl order and, I kid you not, they will come back and ask if you want another bowl (very irritating and makes the servers look foolish, especially if ALL of them are doing that like my experiences). They always are switching your waiter it seems or they can't keep track of their tables. This one guy took my order for a water($1.50), and an entire hour passed until I finally told my original waitress. THEY WERE NOT EVEN THAT BUSY! They have always been completely understaffed for the Friday and Saturday evenings (10p-12a) I have gone and the waiters act like they can't remember their own names. It takes about 20 -30 min average to get your hookah from the time you order AND they don't even milk the hookah for you.

That leads me to the true reason you would go to a hookah lounge: the hookah quality. Out of the ten or twelve hookah bowls I have had here, only three hit really nicely. I know some flavors hit better than others, but I mean I have had a cigarette hit better than those hookahs. The specialty house flavors(not just basic, single flavors but these are mixed with two or more) are nothing to brag about. I like the Spiced Chai and the Shooting Star best. Even if you ask for help to get it going, the waiters will take a fat inhale and act like it is fine, then you get it back thinking it's better, and nothing has changed. 

The DJs are either ON or wayyyy OFF. It is either whack, random mixes, or some good quality bangers\/hits. The dancing is pretty ratchet, it is usually just a couple of people who are going crazy with twerking or yiking or some other wild, fun moves. 

OVERALL:
I don't mind this hookah lounge. It isn't obnoxious and it is a safe, fun environment.  From the hookah lounges I have come from though, this is low grade for sure. They may have put in good money into the appearance, but the service is so poor. 
For the future customers: 
          try all the flavors you can, it is $13 all you can smoke
          don't bring a large party bigger than 4 unless you can figure something out                               with the management
          be a patient person and expect to wait quite awhile, even if it seems not so crowded

For the business (this is NOT to be rude, it is just things I feel might help get more positive feedback): 
          please try to staff for busier nights
          please try to fix the seating issue, it's like the second biggest problem
          please get creative and start making a larger menu
          please try to help enhance your waiters' performance by emphasizing organization and communication skills
          please try to maybe have the waiters milk the hookahs for customers, it is just annoying
          please make customer service NUMBER 1 always, that is the biggest problem

Thank You and I hope my review helped at least one of you readers :)"	2	Sitara Hookah Lounge	3.5
Not much to say other than the food was terrible. My hamburger was the driest hamburger I have ever eaten and it gave me a stomach ache. My friend ordered the Mac n' cheese and she immediately got food poisoning. Needless to say our trip to Vegas to celebrate her birthday didn't go as planned after she got sick from the food. As a result we didn't even try the dessert, which we were excited for. The service was okay but not enough to give this place more than a one star rating.	1	Serendipity 3	3
"We made a reservation expecting a very special dining experience. We came away disappointed.
1. We were seated in the bar area and we were unable to talk to each other because of the noise level.
2. The wine selection menu was very overpriced. Triple even quadrupled what I would pay for the same bottle of wine in other restaurants carrying the same year
3. The food was overpriced for what you were served and sub par preparation made it even more frustrating. The halibut was over cooked and at the $36 price tag made it even harder to swallow"	2	Rose. Rabbit. Lie	4
"Today is the 4th time I've been here. Today my food came out really quick, it tasted fresh. Today I got a Carne asada burrito with beans, cheese, onions, cilantro and rice. It was pretty good but I was not absolutely blown away.

The only two concerns I have had here are it sometimes takes them a little while before someone acknowledges that you're there, and my second gripe is they never have any Pico DE Gallo . I've eaten so much Mexican food growing up in Los Angeles and even travelling to Mexico several times and I never see a place without it."	4	El Pollo Mobile	4
"I went there on 1-05-17 and normally I don't expect much from Little Caesars because just like they saying goes, ""you get what you pay for""...

The customer service I would rate about a 3 because it seemed no one knew what orders were suppose to be coming out...there were other customers inside who had stated they had been waiting a while for their specific orders.

While i was there, The cashier who waited on me, got an attitude with a customer that came in behind me.

When the customer asked if the order she placed on the table was, the cashier responded ""thats what your ordered isn't it"" in a very rude and sarcastic tone.

Not only that but my pizza was cold when I received it.

If I could avoid going on in to this location in the future I would."	2	Little Ceasars Pizza	1.5
"I really enjoy Aloha Kitchen.

Whenever I'm in the area I try to stop in.

On my last visit I ordered the Kalbi Combo. Which comes with the kalbi short ribs, teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu, rice and macaroni salad.

Now I've tried their katsu several times and I don't really like it so I swap my katsu for teriyaki everytime.

The short ribs are a little pricey if you order an entire dinner of them, so I order this combo so I at least get a taste of them without breaking the bank, but it always leaves me desiring more.

This and the actual wait times that it takes to get your food sometimes is why I ranked them 4 stars instead of 5."	4	Aloha Kitchen & Bar	3.5
"I came in the drive thru one night and there was a cone placed in the driveway...thinking it was an accident because it wasn't even midnight yet, I drove around it.

I drove to the window and honked my horn and one of the employees came to the window and let me know they were temporarily closed because the people suppose to be helping on his shift had not gotten there yet.

Now I understand things happen however when I drove back around to the driveway I saw the employee I had just spoken with standing outside talking to 2 other employees that appeared to have just gotten off duty. 

Now I know if there shift was over they are not required to stay, however if they were just going to be standing around in the parking lot talking and making jokes they could have easily stayed in the kitchen until someone released them.

Other than this trip I would rate the customer service to be about 4 out of 5 and the food to be about 4 out of 5 as well for a fast food restaurant."	2	Jack in the Box	3
"I'm rating this 3 stars because on my last visit the service was good, I got my food in a timely manner, however I just didn't like the taste of it.

I grew up eating taco bell multiple times per week, so I know what good taco bell is suppose to taste like and this just didn't do it for me, except for the caramel  empanada that I ordered. That tasted like golden perfection.

So if you go to this location please do yourself a favor and get the caramel empanada other than that I can't recommend anything else except for the Baja blast drink."	3	Taco Bell	3
"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas period hands down.

The staff is the friendliest I've ever met in my entire life.

I normally get the Carne Asada plate when I visit, it's the absolute best Carne Asada you will get an upscale sit down Mexican restaurant for $20 (or any price)

The margaritas are awesome. I always order strawberry and mango mixed and it's usually heaven in a glass.

Also if you're fortunate to attend one of their monthly tequila tasting dinners do it. You will not regret it even for a second.

Thank you Mark, Kate, Ross and staff you all rock."	5	El Segundo Sol	4

"Treat yourself, Don't cheat yourself...

If you haven't gone to Raising Cane's yet please take the time to do so.

I'm ashamed to admit it but on my last visit to Cane's I ordered a Caniac which is 6 pieces of chicken tenders, crinkle cut French fries, Texas toast, and it normally comes with coleslaw, but I always substitute it for another piece of Texas toast...and I ate the whole thing in one sitting :( lol.

I absolutely love their freshly squeezed lemonade, and one trick I do to make sure I enjoy every drop of it is ask for no ice because if you don't they will surely serve you ice with a shot of lemonade.

Learn from my experience. Everything else is great.

Also make sure you don't go during lunch time if you want to have the best experience ever."	5	Raising Cane's	4
Well to start my expectations for this restaurant was a little on the low side since I've been slightly disappointed at other soul food restaurants. They haven't been bad but definitely not on par to real southern soul food. This one right here was not only delicious but far far exceeded my expectations. Everything I ate was the bomb! I sampled from my husband's plate and his smothered liver was perfection. My best friend's red snapper looked right out of a magazine and tasted divine! If you haven't tried this M&M Soul Food restaurant I advise you to do so. No disappointments her! You'll love it!	5	M&M Soul Food Cafe	3

"Customer service fails!!! 
We place the order by telephone, order was 12 chicken strips, fries, beans, two blue cheeses, and an order of cheese sauce. After spending the 15-20 minute drive there and back each way (obviously not one in my area) open the sack only to find the sauces missing. What is the meal without the sauce. Called to complain, placed on hold, even spoke up and said I didn't want to be on hold because I had an order problem. On hold anyways. Hung up, called back and again said I had an order problem, the manager, Shawn, Swan or something said that the only thing he would do is give me free sauce the next time I came in... What? No I'm not satisfied by getting free sauce that I have already paid for on my next visit. A bigger attempt at a discount or comp would have been the only way I was going to be satisfied. My meal was not complete. Very disappointed!!!!"	1	Wingstop	3

It's what I expected for a kids pizza place. Not the best pizza, but salad bar was ok, lots of pasta and sauces to choose from, chicken legs, and desserts were ok. I liked the fact they had different rooms to eat in, we are the Disney room where the tv kept her interest. For taking a 2 year old I was pleasantly surprised that there were several games and 3 small rides that she could do. This kids play land is where I was disappointed, just a few little tykes type slides and a house, and two plastic animals to climb on. I could tell right away it was dirty, candy wrappers from the night before and a wad of gum are just the things I saw upon entering. We were there at open on our trip this day, by the way. The staff needs to be taught to clean these playhouses and slides and definitely keep the carpet clean, this room has kids on the floor. Staff needs a check list for cleaning.	3	John's Incredible Pizza Company	3
Came in for dinner with my husband and was seated right away. We did have a reservation and I'm glad because we occupied the last available table in doors. I had no idea how the service or food would be after reading so many mixed reviews. But our server Brittany was attentive had a smile on her face the whole time. I had the charbroiled oysters and the catfish platter with the grits and green beans. Both dishes came out piping hot and full of flavor. The grits were great but the green beans I wouldn't order again. My husband had a cup of gumbo, and the red beans and rice with extra sausage. He enjoyed  both dishes but didn't like so much of the okra in the gumbo. Overall everything was good and will definitely return.	5	Lola's A Louisana Kitchen	4
Came in for dinner and all of my appetizers were tasty and came out piping hot. We sat at the grill and had a pretty good dinner. Service was great.	4	Benihana	4
While the food was average, this place lost major points with me for its lack of cleanliness in the food areas as well as the seating areas. Only half of buffet was open because I'm assuming it's not busy enough for the place to be fully functional, but with that being said, since it was not a busy night I cannot understand why things weren't more tidy and replenished sooner, if at all. When it was time to visit the game area everything seemed to be working, nothing was out of order. But there were not enough attendants operating the rides. So more then a few times tonight my kids waited until someone showed up to be able to get on the very few rides they have. I understand that business demands dictate staffing, but what's the point of me purchasing unlimited rides for 3 hours when your rides aren't being offered at an unlimited pace? I'd definitely seek out other kid friendly places before spending money here again.	1	John's Incredible Pizza Company	3
Best Mexican food! Authentic, and great customer service. I've made it a tradition to stop by before leaving Vegas!	5	Bonito Michoacan	4
"ASK FOR RICK to be your waiter!!!! He is so warm towards his guests and looks so passionate about his job (or maybe life in general)! 

My dad, whose trip to the U.S. is his very first one in the Western world, is very picky on the food. I almost gave up hope that he would like any restaurant food I order for him. He doesn't eat beef or lamb, so it narrowed the choices and at least made my life a bit easier. I ordered the Cajun flavor chicken for dad, and surprisingly, he LOVED it.

The rest of us got ginger beef and Thai salad. Everything was delicious and especially pleasing because our waiter Rick was awesome. My parents couldn't have better words for him."	5	Grand Lux Cafe	4
"This place is OVERRATED!

All the sandwiches we ordered (Hawaiian BBQ, chipotle chicken, and Fullmontgu) were just okay. We came because it had 4.5 stars from over 4000 people, but it was so mediocre that it led to deep disappointment.

The spicy tuna went bad. We reported to the manager and the service was good. They offered to refund or give us credit for a free sandwich."	3	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"We ordered Kalefornia Love, Smoke in a Bowl, Cauli(flower)fire, and STEAKation.
Except the Kalefornia Love salad with chicken and portobello was decent, all other dishes were horrible. Smoke in a Bowl and STEAKation burger were totally plain, while the Caulifire was way toooooo salty and spicy. Note that I can eat pretty spicy and I specifically asked them to go light on the buffalo sauce on the cauliflower, since it was for my mom, who prefers less strong flavor.

The juices\/shakes were good. We asked for Beet It without basil or ginger, and a shake Mr. Green with banana, chocolate and whey protein.

I am generally a big fan of healthy food and have been to healthy food restaurants that are way better than this. Maybe it's not a good idea to divide the menu to a ""healthy side"" vs. a ""happy side"". You can be healthy and happy at the same time."	2	SkinnyFATS	4.5
Really, really tasty new taco shop. Delicious carne asada, carnitas and al pastor! I will be back again, and again, and again... If you're considering eating here, do yourself a favor and just go and get some delicious food.	5	Frijoles & Frescas Grilled Tacos	4
Get the honey chicken wings!!! Just do it. You'll thank me for it. They also gave us Bulgogi sliders for free, which were excellent. Japchae was also delicious. The staff was great and very on top of our table. The food came out so fresh, most times we had to wait for it to cool down a bit before we could even try it. This is a great restaurant with a great atmosphere, service and food.	5	9 on the Plate	4

"I saw the road on the side of the street and had to try it. I lived in Korea for a few years and am always craving the flavors I had there. First thing I noticed was that they have squid dopbap! I ate that all the time when I was in Korea and their version of it was quite tasty. I also had the Spam Musubi (I know this isn't Korean, but it sounded good to me at the time). Honestly, it was probably the best I've had anywhere. The service was very friendly, and maybe it's because they had plenty of time to serve me since I was the only one in there. I really hope that more people find this place and enjoy it.

The only drawback for me was that there was a strange smell coming from somewhere. It wasn't evidenced in the food, so I don't think it was the kitchen. Maybe it was from the build out of the restaurant since it's so new, but it was not a pleasant smell at all. Hopefully they get that taken care of. Regardless, it won't keep me from eating there again."	4	K-bop Korean Tapas Restaurant	4.5
"I've been there for lunch and I've been there for dinner. This is my favorite Indian food in Las Vegas. The flavors are all there, but it's not as expensive as many other Indian restaurants in town that I find to have less appealing food.

As far as buffets go, their lunch buffet is excellent. They always have several of my favorite Indian dishes available and they keep the warm, fresh, pillowy naan bread coming. The only problem I have is that I overeat every time I come here for the lunch buffet.

Last night was my first time trying their dinner menu, and it was so delicious. We started with vegetable samosas which were cooked very well. The had a perfect crisp on the outside and beautifully seasoned potato filling inside. Then for our entrees, I ordered Lamb Vindaloo and my wife ordered Chicken Kurma, and we both ordered garic naan to go with it. (Unlike many other Indian restaurants in town, Mt. Everest doesn't charge extra for rice. I very much appreciated that.). The Lamb Vindaloo was the best I've had. So flavorful! The Kurma was very tasty, but a little too sweet for my tastes. My wife loved it though and couldn't stop raving about it the entire meal. She's already mentioned to me how much she's looking forward to eating her leftovers.

Somebody in a previous review seemed to think the fact it's in a building where a Burger King used to be, and in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood is a bad thing. Me? I don't care where it is or what used to be there as long as delicious food and great service provided. This place has both. 

The owner even brought us out a free rice pudding for dessert for us to try. I don't think that's standard for all guests, but it was delicious. I would recommend Mt. Everest India's Cuisine to everybody."	5	Mount Everest India's Cuisine	4.5
Had their Sukiyaki for lunch with prime rib. Broth was delicious, thus so was everything that was cooked in it. Staff was excellent. Very friendly and made me feel very welcome. I will definitely come back here with my wife.	5	Swish	3.5
Truly delicious. Among the best Al Pastor tacos in Vegas, without the huge lines of other places. The service is friendly and fast. I would have taken photos of the food, but it was all eaten up so fast that there was nothing left to photograph, except empty plates.	5	Taco Tijuana	4
"I was excited to try this place because I LOVE Korean food, having lived there for a couple of years. I walked in and the interior was very nice and modern with Korean pop music playing, mixed with other pop songs. The waitress was friendly and I was really looking forward to a great new restaurant to tell my friends about.

However, the first sign of trouble came when I noticed that they charge $1.50 for kimch'i. I have never, ever, ever seen a Korean restaurant charge for kimch'i. It always comes with the meal, even if the cost is built in to the price, you always get kimch'i with your meal. Seeing that made me realize that there likely would be no other side dishes either, like every other Korean restaurant serves (and there weren't.)

The lunch menu is very limited, but reasonably priced. I got the Bibim rice. I've had worse food in my day, but that's hardly a rave review. They make it with a patty on top, which was seared nicely but something about it tasted strange. I would have preferred the traditional way. Also, it does not come with an egg on top, so I had to order that for extra. The meal wasn't terrible, but it rates at the bottom for Bibimpap I've had in town elsewhere. 

So to sum up: Atmosphere - great. Service - friendly, albeit understaffed. Food - substandard. I likely won't return."	2	The Kitchen Gangnam	4
"Having lived in Korea for several years, I can recognize and appreciate good Korean food. While it's not exactly like what one would get in Korea, it is very delicious. Probably the best Bibimpap in town, and best side dishes (banch'an). 

The only thing I've had that was so\/so was the ddokguk. I've never had their sushi, so I can't respond to some of the bad reviews of it. But why go to a Korean restaurant if you want great sushi, anyway? For Korean food, it's tough to beat this place."	4	Maru Korean BBQ & Sushi	3.5
"I wish there were more stars. But, alas, I'm limited to only 5. The food is gourmet quality, the atmosphere is comfortable, and the service is very polite and friendly. 

One thing to remember while you're there is that this is a tapas restaurant. Hence, the portions are smaller then other restaurant portions. But the important thing is the quality. I've been there three times and have tried new things every time. Everything from the Yakisoba, to the Bibimpap to the 30-hour sous vide pork belly has been sublime. 

Ryan, the owner, is so friendly and gracious as a host. I brought my two very small children in to the restaurant and he took time out to play with them and make sure they were happy, as well as the parents. 

If you're reading this review, you should come to this restaurant for truly great food. There's a good chance we'll cross paths there."	5	Moko Ramen Bar	4

Your Valet guy should be terminated!

What do you need a valet parker for if his going to park the car 5 cars away from the door?? There should be designated valet parking spots that aren't 5 spots away from the door.

Also ordered a separate steamed egg and the uni Kobe appetizer.  Uni is great.  Steamed egg is the worst I have ever had; way overcooked that I can't even tell it was egg."	4	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5
I recently stayed at the this casino for the Evo event. They allowed us to to check in early which was greatly appreciated. Our room was very clean. The staff was also very friendly and helpful whenever we had any questions. I do want to say Thank You to their security and those who found and turned in my license. Thank you very much again.	5	LVH - Las Vegas Hotel & Casino	2.5
"I've had dinner here several times. After my lunch experience today I am not sure I will ever return.
For starters I was  charged a dollar for a TO GO order. I highly dislike being charged  for the few steps I took on my own accord to pick up my food. I understand charging for a delivery fee. However, I walked from literally next door. And, when I placed the order not once did they mention there'd be a charge.
I ordered with at least fifteen minutes notice of when I needed the food and was told my order would be ready for pick up within ten minutes. Upon my arrival not only was there no greeter at the door, my food had not yet been prepared. As I am on a limited amount of time for lunch this was an inconvenience.
I ordered the Brie grilled cheese sandwich. It should be renamed to a grilled bread with mushrooms, onions and perhaps some cheese sandwich. I paid good money for a sandwich that did not have much of the main ingredient-cheese.
I was highly disappointed and WILL NOT be ordering lunch there again."	1	Mezzo Bistro and Wine	4
"We stayed at the Mandalay Bay hotel 12\/27-30 and went here for breakfast and had such amazing food and service we ended up only eating here for every meal the rest of the trip.  We were with our whole family for a wedding and this ended up being everyone's restaurant of choice...plus we directed a couple strangers looking for a good restaurant mid-day to here and saw them there.
The food, staff, entertainment, overall vibe of this place is amazing!! A special thank you to the waitress from HB (forgot her name :-( ) that is a trainer for them."	5	Rí Rá Irish Pub	4
Pleasant chill spot tucked away in Chinatown. Reminds me of dessert cafes in City of Walnut. Small business, comfortable atmosphere with hipster style decorations. Appears one person is working the counter while tending the tables and assume making the desserts. Definitely a place for younger people yet friendly for mid 30's peeps like me. I see myself coming back for another try.	5	Is Sweet	4
"While in Vegas we stopped by a place called Rosemary's Restaurant. Despite being located in the back of a tacky strip mall, Rosemary's was quite an elegant place to dine. The waiters brought by a black napkin to match my black pants (and refolded the napkins every time one of us got up from our chairs.) The lunch special included a choice of appetizer, main and dessert.

Everything was delicious. For appetizers we tried the Texas BBQ Shrimp with Maytag blue cheese coleslaw: a healthy serving of shrimp with a tasty BBQ sauce. The blue cheese coleslaw was fresh and went perfectly with the shrimp (think buffalo chicken gone gourmet.) The salads were also excellent, the mixed baby greens tossed in a champagne vinaigrette with smoked salmon, quail egg, capers, house-made cucumbers, and drizzles of saffron aioli, was delicious as well as the arugula, endive and radicchio salad with Maytag blue cheese, Riesling poached pear, toasted hazelnuts and port wine syrup. I highly recommend both options.

The vegetarian main of fresh mozzarella and slow roasted tomato stuffed eggplant ""packages"" with roasted red bell peppers, green olive relish, and smoked tomato butter sauce was a little disappointing. The eggplant hadn't been cooked long enough and was a bit tough and bitter. Still, the smoked tomato flavor was really delicious. The creole seasoned shrimp with Anson Mills Carolina cheesy quick grits, Andouille red bean sauce, and grilled green onion was amazing. The smokiness of the Andouille went really well with the dish. All the portions were large and it was difficult to conceive of dessert.

Even so, we finished our meal with the rustic apple tart with caramel sauce, candied walnuts and cinnamon ice cream, as well as a selection of sorbet (made in-house.) All were very good, with the apple tart being particularly delicious.

Rosemary's is on the pricey side, so I would recommend getting the lunch deal (and arriving hungry!)"	3	Rosemary's Restaurant	4.5
"While on holiday in Vegas, we stopped by the gorgeous Bellagio Hotel. Filled with freshly cut orchids, and covered with gorgeous mosaic tiling, this place was decadence to behold. In the lobby one can look up to larger-then-life hand blown glass flowers by Dale Chihuly.

And of course, a true world-class resort is not complete without its own World Pastry Champion. Stop by and see the work of Chef Jean-Philppe Maury. Be dazzeled by the floor-to-ceiling glass chocolate fountain, or the beautifully crafted chocolates, pastries, cakes and crepes. My personal favorite was the elegant strawberry tart: bright, fresh berries sliced atop a thin, swirly macaroon and light vanilla cream. Yum!"	5	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
"We were just there on Friday night - June 15th. I went with a few other girls as part of a bachelorette party.  Because of a combo deal coupon with the Thunder Down Under tickets we bought, we really didn't pay all that much for the 3 course meal we received (like less than 10 dollars a person!). I am grateful for that, because if I had paid the regular price, I would have flipped my lid.

Three girls ordered steak, one ordered the salmon, and I ordered the chicken rotisserie. All these came with starter salads and dessert. The basket of bread was good - in particular their cranberry whole wheat.

My mixed salad was overdressed with blue dressing. It became a soggy mess, and I had to put it aside.  

The girls said their steak was very good, but wouldn't call it excellent. I tried a piece of one girl's salmon, but I found it a bit too salty for my taste. She said she enjoyed it.  My chicken was moist, a bit salty, and I found the portion huge - at least for two people. I could not finish it. It was not very memorable - I've had that chicken elsewhere.  A strange thing was that there was no side to the protein on our plates, other then one small vegetable (mine was a roasted onion with a dried herb stuck into it).  Potatoes? Rice? Hello?

The dessert was a choice between chocolate cake (I can't recall exactly, but I think it had a molten chocolate center) and creme brulee.  I chose the latter. Looked fine, but was rather bland throughout.

I'm giving it two stars for the moistness of the chicken and roasted onion (despite the missing side).  For this caliber of restaurant, the food should have been much better. There was a high level of immaturity to the meal, and I'm disappointed with the chefs."	2	Camelot Steakhouse	3
Love these sandwich everyday. Even though they don't offer chicken, they offer so much selection of turkey, beef, vegi, and tuna.	5	Jimmy John's	3.5
"We arrived in Vegas late on a Friday night, right after we checked into Encore, we had a late dinner at the Lakeside. 

We were sitting at a table with the view of the artificial lake. There was some waterfall and lighting show right above the lake. It was quite a visual pleasure during dining. 

We ordered the seafood platter and some small appetizers. They were really good. On top of it, the wine concierge recommended a white wine that went well with our pallet and our food. Big applause for him. 

We were really happy with the meal and the service."	5	Lakeside	3.5
"We stayed at Encore during our Vegas trip, we tried a few restaurants within the hotel, Society Cafe was one of them. 

We went there for brunch. We got seated right away. I liked the interior very much such as the black and white floral velvet drapes, the checker styled flooring, the dark leather booth. It had this classy retro feel to it. 

We ordered the crab benedict, choice of three omelette, and the french toast. All of them were excellent. The coffee was good as well. The food was well prepared and not too greasy. 

The waiter provided us with very attentive service. We were definitely satisfied."	5	Society Cafe Encore	4
"We decided to pick Bellagio buffet because of the Yelp review, however, after trying it, we weren't impressed. 

We were there early for dinner to avoid the line, however, we still waited for 20 minutes. I was told it could've been worse.  

There was a large selection of food, but very few ones really stood out. We liked the steamed mussels with the spicy sauce, the salmon sashimi, and some small side dishes. 

I was especially disappointed at the crab legs, they weren't as fresh and they were quite small. It was a let-down to me. 

The dessert were mediocre as well. I didn't try the meat dishes, since I am not a fan of poultry dishes. 

The interior was a bit old and crappy. It was certainly not the modern and classy design we would hope for. 

The price was alright. The service was quite slow. The wine was okay, though. 

Overall, we were not impressed with the food and service there."	3	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
"We were staying at Encore, and had an afternoon flight to catch, we decided to have something small and quick. La Cave was the perfect choice. They offer tapas-styled dishes in the afternoon. 

We ordered the jumbo lump crab lettuce cups, which was incredibly delicious. Very light and well-flavored. There was so much fresh crab meat in the lettuce cup. Awesome!

We also ordered the chilled taylor bay scallop and fiery artichoke, roasted pepper pizza, they were both yummy. 

The wine we ordered were quite satisfactory. Service was great. 

We were sitting outside the patio overlooking the pool area. The weather was warm, nice, and breezy. It was quite an enjoyable late afternoon\/early evening dining experience."	4	La Cave Wine and Food Hideaway	4
"A michelin experience of good food, but terrible service, which left me no choice but giving Picasso a two star. 

We had a weekend stay in Vegas and booked a dinner reservation at Picasso on Saturday night before our show in Bellagio. The deco was a bit dark and heavy, but I did like the flower arrangements throughout the restaurant. 

They offered a few menu options. We were mostly interested in the fixed menu and the prix fixe menu. We could select each course our of a few options. We were all satisfied with pretty much all the courses we ordered. Everything was good, I was especially impressed with the foie gras and the pigeon entrees. 

However, the quality food was tainted by the poor quality of service. The lead server (his name might be Jose). He was rather pushy when I was contemplating if we should ordered the sea bass as the third course, even I picked the Turbot for my main course. We ignored the initial rudeness. 

When finished all our course and ready to ordered dessert. I decided to skip dessert, but  other guests in my diner party did. Then Jose (assuming that's his name) brought me a dessert I didn't order. I told him I didn't order dessert, he said he picked this for me, since dessert is included. Then I said had I known the dessert is included, I'd wished he could have communicated that information to me so that at least I could pick one I liked or my friends liked. 

He got very angry and impatient. He said ""do you want to change the dessert"" with a very condescending tone. ""It'd take 15 minutes"".  I told him not to bother. 

Besides the unpleasant scenarios with this particular waiter. We also noticed other unprofessional service. e.g. waiter at other table dropped the menu on the ground accidentally. Another server of ours made a mistake of swapping the two dishes my friends ordered. 

I was quite surprised that this place has two michelin stars given the service was stunningly terrible. The service staff is obviously not properly trained how to treat customers right. This is possibly the worst service I've had in all the michelin star restaurants I've been to.  They definitely didn't provide me with Picasso level of art in terms of service."	2	Picasso	4.5
"Wonderful sushi and creative desserts to top it off! Sleek and cool ambiance with service that isn't rushed. You may want to give yourself extra time though if you're seeing a show after dinner or are on a tight schedule.

This is a nice spot for sushi and more. There were some pretty unique dishes...a sea bass with black truffle oil for appetizer was really good. The sea bass was so tender and yummy. There was a caulifower with some very light breading that was very good too.

For sushi - the fish seemed really fresh and melted in your mouth. We didn't try the really unusual rolls though - they had some pricey ones.

What I remember was the dessert. The green tea mousse was light and airy topped with matcha powder. The apple fritter with dulce de leche ice cream was very good too. They have a chocolate souffle on the menu too but we were running late so we did not try it.

They also had a variety of sake and cocktails so there's something for everyone here whether you like sushi or not."	4	Sushi Roku	4
Not a bad place to stay - on the monorail line with kitschy attractions to check out inside like the Start Trek Adventure (restaurant and attraction) and Barry Manilow (need I say more). We tried the breakfast buffet since it was free with gold status and it wasn't decent but I would not have been happy if I paid. We stayed in a recently renovated room so that was nice.	3	LVH - Las Vegas Hotel & Casino	2.5
"Food is delicious!
We are vegan and ask for take the meat and egg from the dish and substitute for tofu and with no excuse the young guy said yes no problem!
The little side dishes that come with korean food was amazing, the kimchi delicious and all of them we asked for more and receive 2 times more!
It is the best korean food we have had eaten! And believe me, we had done around a lot trying different places where they have korean food!
The best ever!"	5	Mr Tofu	3.5
"Amazing!    We got lucky, it was the night that Shawn McClain, executive chef was actually cooking.   We were a party of 6 and we all have the premium chef's signature menu for $150.    The waitress warned us that it would be a 2 hour dining experience.    In actuality, between the wine and great company, we were there for 4 hours.

The food looks like something out a magazine, smells great, and tastes refreshing with every bite.   We started out with complimentary oyster to wash our palate, I swear it smells like the ocean, something a little mermaid would enjoy.   Then so many dishes after that, I don't recalled anymore.   My favorite was the pan seared scallops, it was the right texture, best tasting scallops I ever had.

Definitely will be back whenever we go back to Vegas."	5	Sage	4
I absolutely love this place! The atmosphere is calm and inviting. The vegan food options are delicious, and the coffee never disappoints!!	5	Sunrise Coffee	4.5
Finding great flavors in restaurants with vegan options can be a little challenging sometimes. That is certainly not the case here. I decided to try the buffet this Saturday afternoon. There were several options that met my dietary needs, the roti came out fresh and warm my belly was certainly happy. The atmosphere is calm clean and inviting. The staff was friendly and checked on me several times with s smile. I will definitely be back!!!	4	India Masala Bar & Grill	4

Always came here for happy hour especially after a hard days work... Foods good' drinks are great... But the pass 2times we came, it was a let down... 1time... Busy happy hour but the hostess didn't look like she really wanted to help us, so off to Brio we went (great HH too) and now it's cinco de mayo it's 4:30p and busy but still no urgency from a hostess to try and accommodate you, and when we sat in the dinning side the waiter didn't feel accommodating when we said, we're just going to have drinks and get food at the tamale bar... May be the last time we walk in this place... Too bad, I have a big mouth and at the end of the day, customer service is everything to me...	1	Cantina Laredo	3.5
"Very disappointed with the whole dining experience. Expected more i guess... having tried the restaurant at MGM Grand and not to mention affiliation with the famous name !!!
Fine dining at Lupo is overrated... the Cheesecake Factory had better tasting food and presentation... the service exceptionally cold at Lupo... I will never recommend your restaurant... Mandalay Bay doesn't need a mediocre place like yours.  Mandalay Bay should welcome other businesses... you're an embarassment to the resort..."	1	Lupo by Wolfgang Puck	3.5
Too bad there's no negative 5 star . What a disappointment ! The place closed at 10 pm tonight , our party showed up at 855 pm. To make a long story short, the last hour of service sucked, no napkins, plates or chopsticks was given . Had to get our own stuff ! The hot tea I ordered was lukewarm water that was served twice !!! And they charged me !!! So I told the waiter to remove it from the tab , then he gives me back the "corrected" tab , and the hot tea was still on the tab ! I spoke to the lady manager and all she could say was "sorry" . Well , that's that . Jjanga, you just lost a patron , that will spread the word :)	1	Jjanga Steak & Sushi	4.5
A must try... Great food, drinks and people... Let's support and keep them here... Well worth keeping in our area...	5	Pinches Tacos	4
Tried it for the first time and enjoyed the hospitality introducing the menu and when I sat and started eating  it took me back to the island  the kalua pork had a nice smoke flavor to it and the spicy pokè was the bomb tasting all fresh, munching on my garlic flavored edamame on the side was like a little treat for my taste buds  don't miss the opportunity to enjoy the same experience (liked it so much, came back the next day and ordered pokè by the pound, oh yes they do, do it' like that)	5	Makai Pacific Island Grill	4.5
"Street tacos, fast, dirty (in a good way!), and flavorful.  Most people get nostalgic with their mom's spaghetti, fried chicken, or whatever.

Not me.  Throw me a plate of tacos de buche, extra crispy tripas, and maybe some sesos if I'm feeling dangerous and I'm blasted back into the past as 11 year old me on an LA street corner taco shop munching away on organ meats.

Would've been 5 stars if i was still recovering from the night before and if they tacos were $0.50 cheaper.

Bottom line: fast, authentic, TJ style tacos at American prices.  Get away from the buffets and get down on some buche."	4	Tacos El Gordo	4
"This is definitely a highly recommended breakfast spot.  It had all the makings of a great place--great food, great service, comfortable seating, etc.  Both locations are a bit of hump off the strip, but are great places to hit up after a weekend of binge drinking and other unsavory activities up to and including: donkey shows, midget lap dances, dice games at the MGM west wing alley way entrance, passing out nudie flyers.  I had the adobo omelette and shared a short stack of the red velvet pancakes with the lady.  Besides creativity, the omelette was pretty spot on.  No surprises here with the chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an omelette.  Just good eats.  I could make a recommendation of trying to use pork instead of chicken next time.

The omelette also came with what could possibly be the best macaroni salad I've had in my life.  Rich and creamy with a possible hint of garlic or something magical, it left me wanting more and licking the tiny bowl the serving came in.

For the piece de resistance--red velvet pancakes.  Seems like a great idea in theory and even better in practice at babystacks.  The pancakes had a perfect melding of  cake and pancake texture while maintaining that subtle red velvet taste.  The cream on top was absolutely phenomenal and I would definitely consider that as a bath water substitute.  

All in all, great place with great food and service. Like I said, it is now a Vegas tradition of mine and you might want to consider making it one of your as well.  Unless, your leaving Vegas tradition is something like midget lap dances.  That sounds way better..."	5	BabyStacks Cafe	4
"Great food! I had a beef crunchy taco plate with rice and beans. Everything was delicious, the taco, the rice... so good and the beans nice and cheesy.
My husband had the carne asada torta. He said it was very good.
This place is clean, delicious and well priced."	5	Roberto's Taco Shop	2.5
So good! Crispy chicken skins are amazing.  Bacon jam is a must try. Jerk turkey burger is so good. Love this place.	5	Carson Kitchen	4.5
"Probably the best meal in Vegas. 
Being pescatarian I had to opt out all the meaty section of the buffet. However there is still enough options to pick from. The seafood station is my favorite, you get to choose a mix of salmon, clams, shrimp, scallops, and mussels with either white wine or a seafood sauce cooked with butter and a pinch of lemon. There were enough crab legs for everyone. The gnocchi might be my favorite vegetarian dish for the night.

The only reason why I'm giving 4 out of 5 is because the dessert is mediocre. My favorite thing was the strawberry macaron and ice cream. I grabbed a bite of most desserts, but they weren't good enough for me to go for a second bite. 

I'll definitely come back for the food. As for dessert maybe just the ice cream."	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
False advertisement! They label themselves as "All You Can Eat" but we were cutoff after only a few rounds of ordering nigiri. We attempted to order more but the waitress said there was a 3 round limit. We questioned it because we definitely surpassed 3 rounds and when we told her this you could clearly see she felt uncomfortable cutting us off. The waitress was really nice but we think the sushi chef had her cut us off as it seemed like they were making up limitations on the fly. There were not sign posted anywhere stating that there was a 3 round limit on nigiri. All in all, the food was descent. Definitely had better but it wasn't bad. The soft shell crab was really good as was the Hot Crunch Roll. Probably wouldn't be back though.	3	Rock n Roll Sushi	3
"If there's a zero-star option i'll rate it.
I ordered bbq pork noodles, the red dye of the pork made my whole bowl of noodle pink. On top of Bad services. And it's not cheap for the food they serve you."	1	Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant	2
"Of course it's expensive....I'm shocked at the people who show up and express dismay.
It's by far the best and most consistent sushi in the country.
The rock shrimp is my favorite appetizer in any sushi restaurant.
The bar has an amazing cocktail menu...very creative.   Try the Acai Serrano martini, wonderful."	4	Nobu	4
"Great lunch spot!!!! Everything from the appetizers (the Wings and Cheesy Garlic Bread) to our entrees was fantastic. I had the Eggplant Sandwich with House Chips and my husband had the Double Stack Burger.  All of it was absolutely fantastic.  The most difficult thing about lunch was picking what to eat because everything on the menu looked absolutely scrumptious! I can't wait to go back and try the S'mores Nachos! 

The staff was quick and friendly and the place is really cool looking without giving the impression of 'trying too hard'. They even had some arcade video games in the back (including Asteroids -to my husband's delight!). 

We will definitely be returning!"	5	Made LV American Tavern	3.5
"I just never get tired of this place. 

Cafe Rio takes Chipotle's concept and puts it on steroids. Juicier meat, tastier sauces and dressings, and faster and friendlier staff. 

I most often order the salad which includes your choice of meat (shredded or grilled chicken, grilled steak, or barbacoa), your choice of beans (black or pinto), rice, lettuce, pico, guacamole, lime wedge, cilantro, cheese and tostada chips. You also get your choice of dressings, the creamy cilantro is to die for!  My favorite part of this is the chicken. I always get the shredded chicken and it is deliciously moist and packed with flavor. 

My husband orders the shredded chicken nachos, and he loves that they sing a silly song when he does. It makes me laugh every time. 

They give our daughter (11months old) a free quesadilla. This probably doesn't seem like much but as a parent who's been charged over and over for food that is inevitably going to end up on the floor, I totally appreciate it! 

The tortillas here are handmade (you can watch them do it) on site and they are so good! Sometimes I come in and just take one to go as a snack (though I would not recommend during lunch or dinner rush). 

It's the little things that take a place with good food and make it a great restaurant. This place has got it all and that is why I keep going back."	5	Cafe Rio	2.5
"We almost always eat here when we are attending an event at the Mandalay Bay Event Center. 

The food is generally delicious no matter what you try.  The complimentary chips and salsa are great.  We also ordered the Baja Ceviche and the Queso Fundido as our starters   The Ceviche is outstanding and quite large. You could definitely order this as your entrée.  The Queso Fundido, which is a cheese dip with shredded beef, was also really good.  Surprisingly, it was not as greasy as I expected it to be which was a total plus! 

I had the Sautéed Shrimp and Scallops.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and had an excellent texture.  They were not at all rubbery.  The broth that the scallops and shrimp were in was very good and the added rice completed the plate.  My husband always orders the Chicken Mole Verde and he loves the Peruvian corn that accompanies it.  

I was very underwhelmed by dessert which is my favorite course. We ordered the Pineapple Upside Down Cake which was dry and the Banana Cream Pie.  The Banana Cream Pie was highly recommended by our waiter which was shocking because it was completely tasteless.

The service at Border Grill can be hit or miss and the service last night was definitely a miss.  At the bar, I ordered a Sangria Margarita.  This drink is so good, but I order it with sugar on the rim in lieu of salt (salted rims are really gross to me).  The drink came with the a salted rim.  I am not one to send something back so I just wiped the salt off and moved along.  At the table the second drink I ordered was also incorrect.  Our waiter kind of lacked personality. I asked him if he knew where their new 2nd Las Vegas location was opening. He explained he ""wasn't moving there so he didn't know."" and seemed visibly annoyed when I asked him if he could ask another server for me. Then he never answered the question. 

Despite this review, based solely on my experience last night, I would still recommend this spot.  We've had better meals here on other nights and I will definitely update my review the next time we go."	3	Border Grill	4
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this grocery store!! 

First of all, it is always clean. Spotless actually and impeccably organized. For a store that stocks so much it is absolutely incredible how easy it is to find things. The shelves are always completely full of everything I want and I'm constantly getting to experience new finds.  My favorite thing about this store is you can find food from other regions!  For example my husband is from NJ and there are lots of things he likes to get when we visit his family.  I was shocked to find some of these foods at my local Glazier's.  I have found fresh pastas from Chicago, mustard I've only been able to find in Cleveland, etc.  Chances are you might be able to find your own tastes from home! 

The deli is absolutely top notch featuring Boar's Head meats and cheeses.  I have ordered many party trays from them including fruit, veggie, cracker\/meat, and shrimp. They are always on time and super fresh. One thing I really like about ordering trays here is that they have a display case and you can actually see what you are ordering.  I have ordered cakes and cupcakes from the bakery in addition to purchasing cookies, donuts, etc. All of it has been super tasty! 

There is a food court in the store which offers all types of different food, as well as, a salad bar and ice cream! This way you never have to grocery shop while hungry!"	5	Glazier's Food Marketplace	3.5
"This is a delicious, family owned and operated, Italian eatery. When you walk in there is a little bakery with all types of treats and cookies. It's really cute looking. We were greeted by a really friendly man who came out of the kitchen to seat us and set up the high chair to accommodate our 11 month old daughter. A younger guy came over almost immediately to grab our drink orders.

We ordered French Fries to keep our little one occupied and they brought them out right away. She gave them two tiny thumbs up. My husband loved the Veal Parmesan. I ordered the meatball sub. It was excellent. The meatballs were extremely moist and the sauce was very well seasoned. A lot of times I can find sauces to be too salty but that was not the case here. Also, it was so big that I was stuffed after eating just half of it. I packed the rest up and it reheated awesomely in my microwave the next day. 

We were so stuffed we had to decline the cannoli when the server offered but he did return to our table with a few little mini cookies for our daughter. She loved him and I thought it was a really sweet touch. 

We will absolutely return for the yummy Italian food and friendly service."	4	Montesano's Eateria	4.5
"We had an outstanding meal here! 

I tried: 
Bruschetta (prepared upon request) 
Salad with lump crab meat. 
Beet Salad
Scallop Entree
New York Strip
Polenta Fries with Parmesan
Tiramisu 
Ricotta Lollipops

The Bruschetta is not on the menu. The server, after hearing my husband ask me if it was on the menu (he didn't know what it was called), stated that he would ask the chef to prepare it. It was a delicious treat. 

I cannot remember exactly what it was called but I got the salad with lump crab meat and avocado. It was outstanding. I want to go back just to have it again. Additionally I tried the beet salad. It was perfectly dressed and fantastic. 

I ordered the New York Strip Medium and, while the steak was good, it was a little too charred for my taste. I ordered the polenta fries for my side. Sprinkled with parmesan, they were very tasty. 

Dessert stole the show! We had the Ricotta Lollipops. They were so good. The Ricotta cheese on the inside was sweet and creamy. The crust on the outside was chocolate with little crunchy crispies. These were to die for. Additionally, we had the Tiramisu. I'm not the biggest fan of this dish but it was very good here. The cake was very moist and the coffee flavor was not too overbearing. 

The ambiance in this place is elegant but  cool. It seems like a place that Mr. Sinatra would have hung out in with his friends. We came 5 days before Christmas and got to listen to Christmas carols, Sinatra style, so that was a treat. 

All in all excellent food, great service, cool vibe. I can't wait to return!"	4	Sinatra	4
"This place is a perfect blend of class and deliciousness! 

I took my husband here for his birthday and the service was absolutely top notch! When they called the day before to confirm the reservation, I mentioned it was his birthday and I swear he may as well have been wearing a Birthday Badge! Everyone from the hostess to the sommelier wished him a happy birthday and the waiter thanked us numerous times for celebrating the occasion with them.

The food here is yummy and, while you can expect to pay a good deal for it, the place does offer complimentary bottled water, chef's choice amuse bouche, a tasty sorbet intermezzo, complimentary additional sides and (in our particular case) a little birthday cake for my husband. All in all the extras, combined with the tasty food, stellar service, and beautiful ambiance definitely lessen the blow of the bill. 

I tried: 

The Langoustines which were flash fried and served over a bed of deliciously spiced lentils covered in the Zezette Boullion. Our served told me this sauce is always featured on the chef's ever changing menus. I can't tell why, as the flavor was out of this world. I almost asked for a spoon! 

Pierre's Salad. If I was a chef I wouldn't blink an eye before putting my name on this yummy concoction. Beets, caramelized pecans, and cheese, need I say more? 

The Filet & my husband's Ribeye. The ribeye was fatty for my taste, which is due to the cut of the meat not the preparation, but it was good. My filet was perfect in every way. The sides we chose were the mixed vegetables and puréed potato. The server brought us these yummy think French fries as a bonus. All of the sides were great.  

We really wanted to try the cheese course but we couldn't do it as we were stuffed after everything else we had tried! Next time for sure. 

The sommelier here was outstanding. I'm wishing I could remember his name. My husband can be a pain when it comes to wine selection and I've seen many a sommelier become flustered.  He was in rare form last night while trying to choose the perfect bottle, and changed his mind quite a bit. The sommelier was very knowledgable and helpful. 

I cannot wait to go back and try something else!!!"	5	Twist by Pierre Gagnaire	4.5
"I like the atmosphere here..it's casual but classy with yummy comfort food. They have a couple TVs in the dining area in case you want to watch the football game, which the hubs appreciated. 
I love pizza! And what I love about Due Forni is they completely thought out of the box when creating their pizzas. We ordered the Tartufo with the truffle creme, mushrooms, and the fried egg. The crust was bready, but not in a bad, raw dough kind of way, while the bottom was a tad crispy. All of the ingredients had a fresh taste. The garlic bread on the appetizer menu may have been the best I've ever had! It was so fluffy, not greasy and heavy like most. Our server was knowledgeable about everything we asked him about on the menu, he even made suggestions based on our likes and dislikes. I will say the drinks are a bit overpriced. My husband ordered bourbon (Bulleit) their selection was lacking. I really wanted a sweet white wine, but was advised that what they had probably wouldn't suit my fancy. No biggie, there's a bunch of mixed drinks to chose from. 
There was a slight mishap with our dinner, but nothing we were worried about. Our server felt bad anyway and brought us a complimentary dessert to share!"	4	Due Forni	4
"I've tried and tried numerous times to really like this place.. I will say the margaritas are delicious, but they better be at $10-$11 a piece. We normally like to sit at the bar as we are very casual people. However, when I can see and hear the hostess clipping her nails from where I'm sitting, it's pretty disgusting! I hope to God one of those didn't fly into my food! We ordered the fresh guacamole that they make table side. This is the third time I've ordered this.. I know they have all the ingredients placed in front of you, but I swear it tastes very much like a ton of green pepper, which I very much dislike.. keep in mind I've eaten guacamole about 95 other times with no issues.. so after the guac, salsa, and chips we weren't super hungry and opted for the queso with sausage. ICK!! I had to sop up the grease with a napkin. And this was no queso I'd ever had it was basically a melted brick cheese.. 
on previous visits we have ordered combo meals and have been less than impressed. If I were to go back here, it would be for drinks with only..and you're buying!!"	2	Lindo Michoacan	3.5
"I love Panera. I'm sad that there aren't more of them here in Vegas. I'd totally hit them up for more lunches.. It's a great alternative to fast food. It's like fresher food fast. I'm not going to lie, some of it can taste a bit processed. But for the most part the soup and sandwiches are spot on.  I recently ordered the steak sandwich. The white cheddar was so thick and creamy delicious..The broccoli cheddar soup is always an amazing experience. Thick, creamy cheddar surrounding chunks of broccoli....yummy!! Ask for a piece of a baguette, it goes fabulously with the soup! My lemonade was not served with a lemon in my cup (like normally)..but I won't hold a grudge..

Have a meeting or just want to spring for a dozen bagels? They are fresh and tasty.. I love the asiago cheese.. Mmmmmm.. 

There are all sorts of baked goods, check it out... Service is friendly and attentive. I'll be back super soon!"	4	Panera Bread	3.5
This place can be easily missed as its in a tiny strip mall.. We drove by and decided to check it out. I was hesitant once we entered and found the place nearly empty on a Sunday evening. Sure, it's nice to not have to wait for a table, but why is nobody else here?? You can sit at the sushi bar or the big tables for teppanyaki. We opted for the entertainment, so we sat at the big table. The staff was very attentive, maybe too much.. There was a man and woman waiting on us in tandem and they clearly didn't communicate. No biggie.. Our chef was super entertaining! All the same old tricks we've seen at other places, but still fun..catching things in his hat, volcano smoke out of the onion, etc.. I oered scallops and filet. I asked for my filet to be rare plus, it was more like medium :-( why is everyone afraid to leave the meat a tad bloody? Other than that, everything was pretty decent. Sushi I fresh and delish. We ordered noodles, which was almost $5 extra!! And I was disappointed when everyone received rice but me..not sure why..	4	Hokkaido Teppanyaki Steak House	4
I love the service here, they're on it! Walking into the restaurant you feel a sense of stratospheric nostalgia. From the decor to the crisp white uniforms with the wedge cap.. I definitely feel like a valued customer. The menu is very simple. They have a single or double hamburger, fries, soft drinks, and milkshakes. That's it. Don't look for variations of burgers or chicken sandwiches, this exactly what it's called...In and Out Burger! To be truthful, I don't care for the fries, I think they're lacking flavor. Not to mention the last two times I ordered take out, mine were cold. I don't live more than a couple miles away. To be fair, try dining in first. The burgers have a special sauce that is the icing on the cake,  it's not too sweet, but it offsets the raw onions perfectly. To satisfy your late night cravings, they're open until 1:30 am.	4	In-N-Out Burger	4.5
Conveniently located inside Red Rock Casino you will find this little gem. When the weather permits, they have a huge outdoor seating area nearly beside the fountain out front. Because it was chilly, we sat inside.. I found the high top chairs slightly difficult to get into only because I'm incredibly short, but I managed! My husband and I went here to check their happy hour. They were offering $10 bottomless house Margaritas, and were they ever delish! Typically house drinks are made of horrible well liquor and are gross, but that wasn'tthe case here..smooth and tasty! But be careful, that tequila sneaks up on you.. As a Yelp check in, we got a free guacamole...one of the best I've had...really fresh and flavorful. The corn fritters were amazing! The batter isn't at all greasy, it was reminiscent of a holiday corn bread.. Our server was on top of getting our drinks refilled and supplying us with fresh chips. I can't comment on the dinners, we didn't order any. Based on what people around us ordered, all looked good. Next time we'll stay for the main dish fo sho!	5	Libre Mexican Cantina	4
I like the whole theme of this restaurant. It takes ya back to the elementary school days. As you walk through the dining area, you come upon these giant globes hanging from the ceiling, which reminded me just of the solar system in my school library. We were seated at a table with chairs, but there are also booths and bar seating. The chairs are a cute small scale black metal chair, of course following the school motif, but are not at all comfortable. It's very noisy in here, but it didn't affect our conversation too much. The menu is very different, but some safe choices too. Bangers and mash, fish and chips, pizza, etc. I ordered the Mac and cheese app as my meal accompanied with a cup of tortilla soup. The soup was forgotten and I had to ask for it, not a big deal..it wasn't too spicy, just the right amount. The Mac had chorizo in it, which I found way too salty. My friend had fish and chips. She said it was good, but the fries were even better! As an appetizer, we opted for the calamari. It came with a ginger aioli that was delish. The calamari was heavily breaded, but ok. I'd like to go back when it's a bit warmer as they have outdoor seating looking down on the courtyard. We asked for a to-go box and also received a brown paper bag labeled 'homework', so cute!	3	Public School 702	3.5
"Went here for the Cinco de Mayo celebration.. I almost turned around and went home because I couldn't find a parking spot..then in the very far last row waaaaayyyyy far away opens up a spot. No big deal, it's a special event.. The restaurant is sort of small, but there's also outdoor seating on the side. Check out the window into the kitchen for a peek at tortillas in the making, it's a cool feature..
For the special event there were a bunch of tables set up outside in front of the restaurant with a stage for a mariachi band and a raffle. The tent outside had very limited drink selections - beer and plain margaritas.  I opted to go inside and hit up the full service bar. There was a gal bartender that made an amazing raspberry margarita. $17 for a small margarita and a shot of Don Julio...
Back outside, we started getting hungry.. Unfortunately there was no food service outside. I appreciate the whole setup, but you shouldn't have a courtyard full of drinking patrons and not allow some kind of snacks..at least some chips and salsa! 
I prefer the Lindo in Summerlin South.. It's larger and seems a tad nicer."	3	Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant	3.5
I am sad to say this went from my favorite BK to the worst! I don't go to the fast food drive thru very often, but when I do, I shoot for this place. In the recent past, I've had excellent service (during the weekday). Tonight and two Saturdays ago, horrible. I thought I'd give it another try tonight because I've had such great luck there. I ordered a Whopper with cheese with extra mayo and ketchup, doesn't seem too complex to me.. After waiting at the window a couple minutes, I was asked to pull around to the other side and they'd bring my food out. Not a big deal at this point. A different guy runs my food out. I drive away and then notice it's wrong. I go back to the window and waited a few more minutes. At this point I just want my money back. I've heard too many horror stories of what some people do when you return food. The guy manning the window was fine. The problem I have was the manager in duty. He handed me my money and said have a nice day. All I really wanted was a simple apology. I looked at him for a second and he ever so insincerely said sorry..he called me mean and shut the window as I started to pull away. I couldn't believe how rude this kid was. So I wasted 22 minutes, was still hungry, and now late for my appointment. In search of a new BK...	1	Burger King	3
I was pretty excited to try something new and within five miles of my house. We had friends over and decided to order take out. My hubby was jonesing for some pasta, I thought this would be perfect! The pics and reviews on Yelp were favorable, so I thought.. So, I may have had an extensive order, but the hostess repeated everything correctly, so I thought we'd be good. I ordered two appetizers, garlic bread and crab cakes. One fettuccine Alfredo, lobster ravioli, veal Parmesan, and baked ziti.. first of all, we immediately took everything out of the bag upon our return home to find that our $20 crab cake app was missing.. I called the restaurant and the gal (Stephanie) apologized. I'm sorry, but a simple sorry doesn't cut it. I told her we'd be right back to pick it up.. My husband went inside after driving all the way back and she didn't offer anything for her mistake, not even an apology to him. He mentioned having to drive another almost 10 mile round trip back and she said he could get a free crab cake next time we dine in. Hmmmm thanks. My husband tipped this girl to simply place our food in a bag, but that couldn't even be done correctly.. So, 15-20 minutes later we get back to the house... all of the dinners are basically lukewarm by now. The garlic bread was inedible. I tried one piece and practically broke my tooth it was so overdone. The lobster ravioli was ok..it was packed kinda weird...the meat was cold and separate from the ravioli and sauce..it was also very fishy. The veal parm was pretty good, I'll give be them that.. the fettuccine Alfredo was not great..it was basically buttery noodles, not an Alfredo by any means... the baked ziti was probably the most basic yet decent dish we ordered. I may give them another chance, we do have the crab cake credit to redeem...but it won't be anytime soon...	2	Mastrioni's	4
"This first time I went here, five stars!! We sat outside in a super cozy booth with a fire table and had an excellent server during happy hour. She was so attentive but not smothering. The happy hour here is different than what we are used to at local PT'S, but that's ok, it's a different place and vibe. We ordered a couple appetizers and beers and enjoyed every second of it. They even had TVs outside so we could watch the football games. 
Our second time here, meh. We had a male server that (I forgot his name) but he looked like Harry Potter..sort of.. the service was very slow and we had to ask for everything, i.e. drink refills, condiments, our bill... lol! It was between lunch and happy hour on our second visit and very few customers inside. We waited almost a year for this place to be remodeled..they did an excellent job. We love the location as it's really close to our house. Hopefully the last time I was there was ""an off"" day. I'll give them another chance based on my first visit!"	4	SG Bar	3.5
I am confused by all of the great reviews for Hush Puppy.. perhaps we came on a really off day?? This was a very disappointing meal. My husband who eats basically anything and doesn't complain kept going on about how mediocre it was. In my opinion, Long John Silvers would win an award if it were just these two in the running.. I'll start from the beginning... we received complimentary hush puppies with a side of butter. To say that I am a giant hush puppies fan would be an understatement. Any puppies I've had have been made from cornbread, these didn't even resemble the taste of cornbread..huge disappointment!! Then  we order drinks. They offer Pepsi products, sweet tea, beer, wine, and margaritas. Hmmm, no bar but margaritas, I'll give it a shot. I don't know what was in this, but it was garnished with a lemon and reminded me of the cheap stuff I could only afford when underage.. Two clues right off the bat.. My husband ordered a Mexican beer typically served with a lime..they only have lemons.. So our waitress, Dawn told us about the daily special...all you can eat ribs, catfish, and shrimp..with fries and salad bar for $18.95. Seems reasonable and based on the reviews, we're game! I opted to upgrade to a baked potato for 50 cents. So the salad bar is ok. It has very few salad toppings and only iceberg lettuce. I opted for the blue cheese dressing, after all I'm indulging, right? It was bland. Sad face. The best thing on the salad bar was the coleslaw and macaroni salad. We had a small snow crab appetizer that was decent. My husband ordered a cup of gumbo that did not resemble pics in other Yelp reviews. Typically gumbo contains sausage and a seafood..this has a shredded meat of unknown origin. He said it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't a true gumbo. So here comes our entree..the rib portion was three bones, two pieces of dry catfish (that was pretty fishy even for my hubby the fish lover..) and the four pieces of shrimp tasted like frozen food. I tried to camouflage the shrimp with their homemade cocktail sauce, even that was weird..it tasted like it may have been expired. I figured I could salvage the ribs with BBQ sauce from home..I asked for another rib and a to go box. The waitress said everything has to be eaten in the restaurant. I still had my entire baked potato, can't I at least have that? She made an exception this once since it was my first time. I would've given the 3 bones she just gave me back...it's not like I got six more of everything. There were a few loud mouth patrons in the same dining room I was in, this was annoying. Not the restaurants fault, but maybe they could seat like people in separate areas as there was an entirely additional dining room. Maybe seat families here, and ghetto swearing singles over there.?? So as I finish, I'm wondering should I really give even two stars? Yes! The waitress was on point and super friendly, the crab and macaroni salad was actually good. I'm just really bummed nothing else worked out cuz we need a good seafood joint to frequent. Oh well, moving on..	2	The Hush Puppy	4
"If you've never had ""thee honey baked ham"" you are certainly missing out! They have nailed down the best recipe. Don't be fooled by random honey baked hams available at the grocery store, you'll be horribly disappointed. You will pay more, but mark my words, it's worth it! My favorite part is the crunchy coating on the outside of the ham! The meat closest to the bone, yummmmmm!
I went here to pick up my ham for Christmas dinner. They have a solid system down pat. There was a semi truck full of hams, they weren't about to run out! As I entered the store, there was roped off area to keep the line well organized. I'll admit, I was bummed to see about 50 people in front of me, but the line moved surprisingly quickly. I like that they have extra items available that you may have not thought about getting..fancy mustards, big sandwich rolls, etc.. I was disappointed that they were out of all side items but one - thankfully it was one we liked, Yukon mashed potatoes..but I was sad that that was it.. I suppose next time I'll go a day earlier..or perhaps they can have more on hand next time."	4	HoneyBaked Ham	4
Now I understand this isn't gourmet Chinese, but it also isn't the place with the golden arches either.. I expect the service and quality to be a smidge better than what I received. I've been here before and it's been better. This visit there were slim pickens.. One entree wasn't even available, I was told it would be five minutes. I'm no restaurant expert, but shouldn't you get things ready to replace well before you run out? So my second choice was my usual sweet fire chicken..sweet with a little kick. I always enjoy the pineapple chunks but didn't get even one this time..sad face.. I ordered the cream cheese rangoon, unfortunately it was way over cooked but my dog didn't mind! There was one person in front of me and it took as long as if there were 12. I'm sure I'll give them another chance, but not too soon..	2	Panda Express	3
"Delicious and fresh food, but very pricey!! I had a hankering one night for a gyro.. I looked on Yelp and found this place. The menu was extensive but kinda of expensive, but hey- it was super close to my house. So I called and placed a take out order, I was told ten minutes. We arrived 15 minutes later - wanted a bit of a buffer, but that wasn't enough. My husband waited inside for about 15 minutes. After he noticed our order sitting on the counter, he asked about it and the guy behind the counter was like, oh yeah...yours is ready. Seriously.. ???
So once I got over the price and the poor service, I found the food delicious! The tzatziki sauce was on point, all the veggies were uber fresh, and the portions of meat left nothing to be desired. Hummus and pita bread was flavorful. The spinach pie was ok, but I've had better. Their rice is light and fluffy and meted in my mouth. I want to eat here more, I just need to save some $ first!"	4	Stephano's Greek & Mediterranean Grill	4
"This is a somewhat hidden gem. It's oddly placed in a tiny stripmall smack dab in the middle of a residential area. I was referred here by a previous coworker. I've been here three times now and have had pretty decent experiences each time. Truffled goat cheese Napolean, um yes please!! The philo puffed pastry is so flaky and buttery, it melts in your mouth.. the goat cheese, mmmmmm! Highly recommended! Service here is hit or miss..
The lobster salad croissant is ok...there are way better things to eat here, take it from me..,I learned the hard way.! 
The turkey sandwich on the lunch menu, yum! 
The burger is one of the best I've ever had in my life! No lie! The Brie is the icing on the cake, so to speak.. I love my red meat, and they cook it to perfection! I can't even explain how melty in my mouth their tenderloin and mashed potatoes is.. 
I swear, you can't go wrong with whatever you order! 
No cocktails here, it's pretty much a wine specialty place.. however, when I mentioned I'm from Michigan where there are a ton of vineyards up north, the waiter suggested they may be able to order me a special wine! Much to my dismay, the request was declined. 
The stocked Riesling is on the sweet side, which is how I like it. If you order a bottle with dinner, they charge a $10 service fee. I don't exactly care for this, but it is what it is. I just would like to be told ahead of time. I've got $10, just let me know! 
The view is so pretty. The facility sits on a tiny lake..it's the desert, not the Pacific coast..we take what we can get! Once here for lunch, a friendly duck even came inside to greet patrons! I do enjoy watching the black swans on the lake...but you can't see them at all at night. It can be kind of cold in the winter (even with the provided heaters).. perhaps another glass of wine will warm you up :-)
One of my favorite local places, I'll be back!"	4	Marché Bacchus	3.5
What a concept! Put a bunch of food in a plastic bag, dress adults in bibs and gloves and let them have at it!!! I ordered the snow crab  and corn fritters, my friend ordered king crab and mussels. The menu is ala carte - you order an entree and choose which level of seasoning you desire. If you want to add bread, rice, or many others, have at it!  Your server will make sure your table is covered in plastic and when she presents you with your seafood, you can literally just dump it on the table and dig in! My snow crab was delicious, though you have to work for it by cracking the shells yourself. My corn fritters were not as great - kind of greasy and too bready, but that's not the main attraction.. There's a full bar to order cocktails should you desire to do so.. I opted for water as I was nursing a hangover, lol! The service was excellent and I can't wait to go again. Garlic butter sauce, yes please!!	4	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
I'm a sucker for an awesome cocktail! The blood orange margarita blew me away! Thankfully it was happy hour and drinks were half price, I downed four! The chips were warm and fresh and the pico had the perfect amount of kick. We ordered queso to cheese up the matter, but I didn't care for it. It's almost like a smidge of meat chili was added to the queso.. The fish taco was average..it didn't knock my socks off. The corn on the cob is amazing! Best ever! Be sure to try the guac...it's the perfect texture- not too creamy nor too chunky. I've been here three times and have had great service each time.	4	Pinches Tacos	4
My boyfriend and I go to Doh every week and we absolutely love it! Love the side dishes, and the meat quality is good! The service is always perfect and quick and there are enough seats in the restaurant so that we have rarely had to wait. We love Doh!	5	Doh Korean BBQ	4
I had read somewhere that this place had great burgers and have been anxious to check it out. I love my red meat! We arrived about 6 on a Friday night and the dining room was practically empty. We opted to sit at the bar. It was happy hour so we ordered cocktails off of the happy hour menu. The bartender kinda gave me crap for wanting to add a shot of Chambourd to my Margarita, but in a joking around-nice way. I decided to try it his way, but should've stuck with what I wanted. The drink wasn't bad, I just was jonesing for a raspberry enhancement. We checked in on Yelp at got a free appetizer! Bonus!! We opted for the pretzel. When it came out I couldn't stop laughing at how gigantic it was. It was yummy and was paired with a couple condiments for dipping. The menu offers several burger concoctions or build your own, which I did. It was slightly overcooked from what I ordered, but that didn't compromise the flavor at all. I like the atmosphere here..friendly patrons and staff..not to mention a nice view of the pool. When you decide to check it out, make sure you go to Palms Place as this is NOT at The Palms.	3	Cafe 6	4
I cannot say enough about the gourmet shrimp taco at Rubio's!!! I'd give 5 stars if the people working the counter were somewhat alive. Being from the Midwest, I was not at all familiar with Rubio's until my cousin recommended I go there. It's fresh food fast. We're not talking about tacos from TBell, this is really tasty stuff! I prefer a flour tortilla which you can substitute instead of corn. I don't know what exactly is in the sauce they put on the taco, but it makes my mouth sooooo happy! There are several types of fish to order as well..pollock, tilapia..grilled or fried. Order a meal and it includes two sides. I order my tacos a la carte and just get two. What's cool is they have a salsa bar from mild to plenty of heat, picante, verde, etc.. This is my new go to place!	4	Rubio's	4
Ok place to go when you're hungry.. we were greeted right away and invited to sit wherever we chose. My husband had a Caesar salad and I had the mushroom and onion burger. The burger was huge and a bit overcooked from my medium rare request. If you like onions, order this! They spare no expense in the toppings. The burger comes with chips, I was hoping for homemade, but it was one of those 25 cent bags that has maybe 8 chips inside...it wasn't a big deal because I was stuffed from the burger. If you want, you can upgrade to fries or coleslaw for a small charge. My husband's salad was average...there wasn't really enough chicken, but the dressing was good. Oh! He also ordered a side of chili and really liked that.. Because it was a late lunch, no cocktails this time around..water only. We never saw our waitress again after our order was taken. The bartender brought us our food, and another gal walking around tidying things brought us our bill. Low key, friendly people.. I'd try it again, but wouldn't go out of my way.	3	Blue Ox Tavern	4.5
I regret checking in after we paid for our lunch as this place is pretty overpriced for what it is. Yelp offered 15% off! Shame on me!! I had been wanting to come here for quite some time as I heard the soups are amazing. First of all, the entrance is very confusing. There are three sets of doors. We followed someone to one set in the front and it was locked. After walking to another set of doors, an employee decided to let us in. Seeing we were lost, he could've explained the beginning of the line. We arrived just after 4 when the price increases from lunch pricing to the dinner rate. I wouldn't mind if the bar were fully stocked, but it wasn't. There were several empty bowls. I dressed a mediocre salad, set it at my table and went off to check out the soups. The station was messy. I sampled two soups - the curry bisque and the mushroom. Both were really salty. I didn't think the curry complemented the bisque whatsoever. The mushroom reminded me of my Campbell soup days. Oh, I forgot.. You have to pay extra for your self serve fountain pop. The price has slipped my mind, but I remember it being not at all worth it. I opted for water. So then you can have dessert, because you will have room in your belly.. There's a soft serve station with minimal fixings.. Then beside that is random additional desserts..that day it was rice pudding and a chocolate lava cake. Sounds delish, but I'd stick with the soft serve.. So then I see people leaving tips. Hmmmm. I've been to buffets in which a server will get you drinks, and that is deserving of a tip. But to tip someone to take my plate away after I leave? Since when do we tip busboys? This wasn't the worst buffet in the world, but for the price I'd rather be served a better quality meal and won't be running back anytime soon.	2	Sweet Tomatoes	3.5
It was my first time here and I ordered takeout which was ready in 10 minutes! However I was sorely disappointed with the spicy tuna hand roll. It did not taste fresh and it was TINY!!! Also, DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN KATSU!!! I ate a few bites and could not stomach the chicken any longer. It was like biting into an eraser. I couldn't even chew it without wanting to gag. What a waste. On the plus side, their Mac salad is probably the best I've ever had!!! Fix your chicken Yummy Grill, that's unacceptable for a restaurant.	2	Yummy Grill & Sushi	3.5
"This place is located very close to the High Roller, as well as our hotel, so we ended up eating here a couple of times. 

I highly recommend the crispy duck wings - they were so good that I ordered them both times I went. Other items on the menu that we tried included the fried calamari, the lobster, crab & artichoke dip, the blue crab cakes, the onion ring tower, the moo shu egg rolls and the coconut shrimp. 

I did not really like the crab cakes, as the flavour of the crab was overpowered by other ingredients that I didn't enjoy. I found the coconut prawns to be too sweet and greasy, but the calamari was quite good - we actually had both types, the regular and the spicy (Kung Pao) version. Both were tasty, but I prefer the original one. 

Service was good, and they have a huge beer selection. I would definitely return if I go back to Vegas. Their Bloody Mary was almost as good as a Caesar - it was spicy and served with a piece of bacon - yum!"	4	Yard House	4
I'm happy to give GRPG a solid four stars. Our meals were piping hot, and the portions were quite large. Also, beer lovers will find their line up of beers to be quite good. I went for something a bit different, and got myself a pint of pear cider. It went very well with their braised pork which I think was cooked to perfection.	4	Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill	3.5
"KF = Kid Friendly (at a decent hour)

I've been here with \/ without kids over a dozen times. I am never hungry or disappointed at the end of our meal. Sometimes we have to wait, but again, with kids it's not worth waiting unless there is something to look forward to. My kids are adventurous, so slimy and raw is perfectly acceptable. However, there are a lot of KF basics such as tempura, calamari, beef and chicken and if that is not acceptable, you can just head up Spring Mountain and hit McDonald's. 
Our personal faves:
- beef tataki (I get 2 orders because I don't like to share this ;)
- calamari - nice and crispy, but if they get rid of the garnishing they can add a few more rings
- pork belly bowl - my 6 year-old won't share this
- beef tongue - yep I said beef tongue. So tender and tasty that tongue is.
- bacon wrapped mochi - who knew?
- mackerel sashimi
- red snapper carpaccio
- sakana pinchos - inside out roll
- yellowtail tartar
- honey toast - if you have room, but we usually get Boba downstairs at Tea Station ;)
And as always parents, don't forget to drink a lot of sake!"	5	Ichiza	4
"I love this place. The wait sucks, but it is usually worth it. I've been here and the first location several times with my kids. They will even wait knowing that they will get to eat the best red velvet and bananas foster pancakes ever. We also love the cinnabun and carrot pancakes. No matter what, ask for their cream cheese sauce. Amazing. As for entrees, my personal favorites are the adobo fried rice (being Filipino) and Kalua pig eggs Benedict. I also ventured to try out the Mexican skillet. Wow. Yeah, leave your diet at home and don't ask for nutritional facts. You are here for the food coma.

They are really five stars, but I deducted one for the long wait. FYI: it is usually a 30-45 minute wait on Saturday \/ Sunday after 9am so bring your coffee, iPad, knitting project or newspaper to help pass the time. You will be pancake hoarding in no time. They have a few TVs in there for watching football games ;)"	4	BabyStacks Cafe	4
"Like the BarMasa in New York, this place is expensive. I was hoping to have a similarly incredible experience, but unfortunately the Vegas version was not nearly as good.

The cocktails like the martini with shiso leaf and cucumber and the Wasabitini with freshly grated wasabi weren't as creative as the cocktails in New York. It doesn't help that martinis are a typically boring cocktail.

The popular Peking duck with foie gras tacos nailed the Peking duck flavor, but the foie was lost. It was okay, but really disappointing given my expectations and when compared to the other outstanding restaurants in Aria like Sage and Bardot."	3	barMASA	2.5
"After have a ""taste"" at Sage, we continued our journey to Julian Serrano for part two of our tasting tour of Aria. We had to stand around and wait for a hostess at Julian Serrano that never came. In a resort casino with plenty of other high-end restaurants willing to take our money, we left and wandered upstairs to try Jean George (located on the second floor above the casino next to Sirio and Michael Mina) which promptly assisted us.

Obviously, we skipped appetizers and went straight into the main course which was a $90 steak special - the Wagyu-like Australian tomahawk chop (think bone-in rib eye with the dark fatty outer cap trimmed). It was an embarrassing piece of meat. The steak lacked everything you'd expect in a cut of beef. It missed flavor, fattiness, and tenderness.

Then there were the steak sauces. I'm a purist who believes a steak sauce needed for bad, flavorless steaks. A really good steak is perfection on its own. Even though the tomahawk was heavily seasoned and charred to create flavor, five different steak sauces were served. This isn't McDonald's or Chik-Fil-A where customers have a choice of dipping sauces for the chicken nuggets. The chef should make a decision and pick one sauce that fits the flavor profile of their cuisine. Instead, it was a colorful Benetton nation of sauces with an airy French hollandaise, a bright and refreshing Mexican salsa verde, an overly sweet BBQ sauce, a super-hot southwestern scotchbonnet, and a mellow Asian tamarind. Aside from the BBQ sauce, they were all expertly executed, but none were good matches with the steak.

The sides were thankfully small and a decent-sized for one person. We tried two sides. The Brussels sprouts with pear and bacon had a forceful zing. By itself, the sprouts were dry and not very exciting, but the acidity helped contract the fattiness of beef. The mushrooms with goat cheese polenta were a disaster. This was the second greasy and overcooked polenta I had that night. The mushrooms were sadly dried-out and tough.

The Mollydooker South Australian Shiraz by the glass was a very nice wine and well suited for the evening.

For dessert, we had a glass of Moscati di Asti that was a fine match with the cinnamon crème brulee with cocoa nibs and figs on the bottom. The use of cinnamon in a brulee is a very smart decision. I can't believe other chefs haven't done this. It seems like a completely obvious combination, but I guess when something is that obvious, it's easy not to think of it."	3	Jean Georges Steakhouse	3.5
"Although nothing there reminded me of Brigitte Bardot, the décor was French like many Vegas brasseries. Unlike those other brasseries, the food was better here. We only came for the daily happy hour from 5-7P, but were very impressed by this recently opened Michael Mina restaurant.

The escargot en crout was so good, we ordered another plate of the tasty bites. The mild and soft snail was deliciously encased in a puff pastry shell rather than just topped with dough. The hazelnut ""salt"" and Chartreuse butter condiments and chives and mushroom garnishes were nice complements, but most were hard to eat WITH the escargot because they didn't attach to the pastry crust. To make it easier to eat, maybe a hazelnut and mushroom cream would be fun to dip into and adhere to the pastry.

They were out of skate wings, so we tried the salmon tartare instead. It was a smart combination of both fresh and smoked salmon that avoided the unpleasant tackiness when only fresh is used. I also liked the subtle use of capers and the thickly spreadable consistency of the chive mascarpone. Another smart choice was the sliced brioche which was friendlier to bite than a shattering crostini toast.

The ""HNYB Sour"" was a solid Cognac-based cocktail with a head of egg white and a float of Beaujolais.

Poorly positioned in the low foot traffic area of Aria's Promenade Level, it's located on the level above the casino next to the Zarkana theater."	4	BARDOT Brasserie	4.5
"Traditional New York high-dining in a fabulous Vegas space and a few flashy circus tricks along the way. I had a wonderful dinner when Marc Poidevin was the chef. I had another wonderful dinner with Wilfred Bergerhausen heading the kitchen. Regardless of who is in the kitchen, sticking with the signature Le Cirque dishes ensures a memorable evening.

The specialty cocktails were all martinis in outrageously tall glasses. Like most martinis, they weren't particularly unique like the ""Deja vu"" with Hendrick's gin, muddled cucumbers, and St. Germain which felt like déjà vu because I've had this combination before at other bars. Despite the common cocktails, the show began with the amuse of smoked salmon on a smoldering bed of dry ice.

For appetizers, the lightly seared whole foie gras was big and rare. The lightest Thai flavors were creatively used to counter the fatty foie. The frog lollipops starter had cute leg bones used as the lollipop sticks. Acid from the mild béarnaise wisely balanced the fry coating on the frog meat ball. For added decadence, sautéed fiddleheads, whole morels, and white asparagus were added.

For entrees, the ""Rabbit Symphony"" was a duo of tender roulade and braised meat. The fried spaetzle added textural crunch and a buttery sauce tied everything together. The potato crusted fish was an upscale presentation of fish, chips, and slaw. The potato crust was thinner than expected which only made the dish more elegant along with increasing the scale of difficulty because it must be challenging to both cook the potato and fish at the same rate. It was also daring to use a red wine sauce with the moist bass.

The signature ""Chocolate Ball"" dessert was another showy dish as the hot chocolate sauce made the chocolate ball shell vanish. It was more showmanship than tasty as it would have been better with a darker chocolate sauce. Ultimately, it was too much like a chocolate sundae. The raspberry soufflé had incredible height and a perfectly browned top. Again, the faultless execution topped the taste.

The wine pairings were on the mark except when both entrees were served with a Bethel Heights, Willamette Valley, Pinot Noir which smelled wonderful, but laid a little flat with the food.

Although jackets are recommended, it's Vegas and they'll seat any true high roller in just about any attire."	5	Le Cirque	4.5
"A true patisserie is generally focused on the obvious pastry, but they offer much more than just wonderful sugary delights. The setup is confusing because there are two lines to buy the many foods.

Order the following at the straight display case on the right:
+ Bakery (5 out of 5 stars): DO NOT SKIP THE PASTRIES. Easily tempted to order the many cakes and tarts, don't miss the heart-shaped palmier which had fantastic qualities like crisp, flaky, buttery, sweet, and sticky. The palmier was perfection and is sometimes sold as small cookies in pre-packaged containers. The Nutella beignet was an exquisitely flavored doughnut sandwich dusted with sugar. The apple brioche beautifully contrasted the firm bready exterior with the almost creamy interior. The sticky bun was topped with wonderful nuts, but needed more cinnamon. The chocolate croissant was good, but could have been sweeter.
+ Take-Out (3 out of 4 stars): Pre-made foods like quiche, fruit and salad bowls, and sandwiches. The roast beef sandwich was juicy and contrasted by the acidic tomatoes and red onions. The ham and cheese sandwich nicely combined the mini baguette and Dijon mustard.
+ Coffee: Sorry, but I don't drink coffee.

Order the following at the round display case on the left:
+ Chocolate (4 out of 5 stars): I've tried six different bon bons. All were smooth, delectable, and focused on the feature flavor. They were small so buy twice as many than normal.
+ Omelet and Crepe Station (2 out of 5 stars): With both sweet and savory crepes, I'd avoid the savory crepe because they use an odd buckwheat batter. With ham, too many sautéed mushrooms, and not enough Swiss cheese, the ""Forest Crepe"" was weird due to a spicy aioli. As if the crepe batter didn't already have enough egg, a fried egg was on top. Maybe my hangover made me imagine this bizarre crepe.

Yelp reviews misstate that the largest chocolate fountain is here when it is at the Bellagio (see www.yelp.com\/biz\/bellagio-conservatory-and-botanical-gardens-las-vegas). Also, roughly a third of the photos posted here are the Bellagio location."	5	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
"When Bachi Burger opened in my hometown of Los Angeles, it received average Yelp reviews and closed before I could try it. I now see why. The carelessly prepared food fits at this suburban movie theater location, but not in a food-centric district like Little Osaka in West LA.

The pork belly steamed buns were nicely constructed with a savoy cabbage and carrot slaw, slice of hard-boiled egg, and hoisin sauce, but the meat was sloppily inconsistent. Of the three buns served, one had pork that was all meat and no fat, another had all fat and no meat, and another had the right balance (much like the three bears). A 33% success rate might work in baseball's batting box, but not when dining.

I liked the fries in the chili cheese fries, but that was about it. There was too much of the heavily spiced oxtail chili in ratio with the fries and the scant amount of cheese. The chili also showed signs of age. The meat had broken down to almost a paste, the mixture lost its ability to emulsify which caused the excessive amount of oil to separate out, and there was a sour taste like it hadn't been cooled properly from the night before. The fried egg on top didn't fit the dish.

I guess I should have tried a burger and plain fries instead of the fancier sounding appetizers because I incorrectly expected food of greater quality."	2	Bachi Burger	4
"The record-holding largest chocolate fountain was a let down. I guess the exaggerated scale of Las Vegas made me expect something on the scale of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory - not something that seemed more like a cascading Champagne pyramid.

The Aria store doesn't have a fountain, but is the better location because they sell more stuff. The Bellagio venue has a patisserie and ice cream, but doesn't have those delicious chocolates (unless you buy them in a pre-selected and pre-packaged box). It also felt cramped, sloppy, and unorganized. Keep in mind, Aria is only a monorail ride way."	3	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
"I'm not a buffet person, but it came with the stay. I like that the foods were spread out so diners had plenty of space to see and serve their food.

The quality of the food varied. The positives included the crab legs, swordfish, and veal shank (although I was very careful to pick the best looking pieces from the chafing dishes). The negatives were the dry prime rib (yes, very sad for the old Vegas buffet tradition), the drier salmon en croute, the soggy fried chicken, and the soggier Italian corn cake. Too bad there wasn't some way to just have my favorites and nothing else.

The drinks were really good. The blueberry comso and the white sangria were high-end concoctions, but little light on the pour. The waiter was nice to let us know which beverages were included and not. Obviously, these alcoholic drinks aren't covered in the pre-paid base fee. The waited also clears the plates, but doesn't replace silverware.

They've done a nice job with the dessert buffet. It's a far cry from squares of Jello like at cafeteria buffets. The selection is large and most of it is above average. It was also nice that the desserts were cut into small portions so more could be tried.

Although expensive for Vegas standards ($32 on Monday dinner when I was there and $32 for brunch), it's not compared to brunch buffets at Ritz-Carlton Hotels which are double in price. Sure, the Ritz-Carlton's are better, but not twice as good. Everything is relative."	3	The Buffet	3.5
"The menu was indulgent with many Petrossian classics like the martini with caviar cube. I ordered a ""grain"" vodka flight of Grey Goose VX, Absolut Elyx, and Stoli Elit. What I received was Grey Goose VX from wheat with a bit of cognac, grape-based Ciroc, and potato-based Chopin. Grapes and potatoes are grains? That food pyramid sure has changed. Regardless of the change-up, the sampling was enjoyable with the VX as my favorite of the three.

For a snack, the potato crisps (like big Terra chips) with caviar aioli were a fun selection.

The ambiance has issues. There is too much bustle from the lobby to make for a relaxing nosh (like $35 afternoon tea from 1-4P) or to enjoy the piano at night until 1A. Although this is a non-smoking bar, it still smelled like smoke due to the casino air."	3	Petrossian Bar	4
"I'm not sure what's more impressive - the cooking in the dining room or the drinks at the bar. Regardless, Sage is both my favorite restaurant and favorite bar in Las Vegas. This was the case when I first visited in 2011 and is still the case in 2015.

With the food, my basic suggestion (or sage advice) is to order the dishes with the most unique combinations. Using ingredients that might seem odd together, chef Shawn McClain somehow makes them harmoniously come together.

For appetizers, the fork-soft grilled octopus with chorizo, spinach, and pickled red onions was a marvelous combination of ingredients. I liked it better when the octopus was heavily charred and daringly served on smoky mashed potatoes, but it was still a wonderfully executed dish. The foie gras custard was so sweet, it was on the verge of being a dessert, but the creamy richness was undeniably good.

For entrées, the scallop and braised oxtail was a gutsy surf and turf combination due to the pairing of gentle scallops with strong oxtail. Additional strong ingredients were used like wild mushrooms, rapini, and butter-laden salted caramel reduction, yet the scallop didn't get lost. Quite amazing. The nicely crusted pork loin dish was fun due to the small singlets of spaetzle and well matched asparagus, but was held back due to the bland poached artichoke and mismatched herbal pork sausage.

If the foie appetizer was like dessert, then it only makes sense to actually make a foie dessert. The foie mousse was coated in chocolate like a candy bar and topped with melding ingredients like candied popcorn, Bourbon caramel, and peanut butter ice cream.

The drinks are impressive in many different ways. They have an international selection of absinthe, infuse their own cocktail ingredients, make their own bitters, stock hard-to-find whiskeys, and offer liquor flights. One Bourbon flight had six different ages of Pappy Van Winkle. Granted, it came at a high price at $500 for half-ounce pours.

The style of the constantly changing cocktail menu is bold. The cocktails here can be strong, herbal, gritty, bitter, rounded, or classic, but never soft, watery, sugary, or fruity. They are cocktails for real connoisseurs.

The only problems I had with this place were music selection and the uncomfortable chairs with cramping arm rests."	5	Sage	4
"This is one of four Hash House locations throughout the Las Vegas area. This one is not located in a casino so parking is much easier.

They serve big portions so don't come here unless you plan on eating - a lot. Otherwise, it's a terrible waste of food. I hope they are part of a food composting program.

The Boston Hash special, which had potatoes and peppers topped with a big Maryland blue crab cake and a spicy remoulade sauce, was a different combination. The crab flavor came through, but was a bit mushy. The scrambled eggs were good and not rubbery. It also came with a very good biscuit. The corned beef hash was simpler than the Boston hash with long strings of beef mixed with cheese on top of potatoes. It also came with the same scrambled eggs and big biscuit.

This is not an old school diner, but an updated version. For example, I had a very nice tangerine juice. Divey diners don't serve fresh juice - let alone tangerines. But let's be clear, it's still diner food. I think customers are overly fascinated with the portion size and ignoring the quality of the food. Take the Boston Hash I had. It had a soft crab cake, soft potatoes, soft peppers, soft eggs, and a soft biscuit. If a texturally-challenged dish like this was served at a Michelin-starred restaurant, it would get ripped apart by unhappy customers as being mushy baby food.

I was tempted to order their 1-pound burger. But hey, it's ONE POUND! That's ridiculous. And this is coming from a guy who, the night before, weighed 148.4 pounds before going to dinner, ate and drank at four places, and then weighed 152.4 pounds after dinner.  (The rooms at the Encore hotel have digital scales.)  One pound is not a problem for someone who can consume four pounds in one night."	3	Hash House A Go Go	4
Located just past the Wynn Buffet, we dropped in after "Le Reve" to have a drink and a snack at the bar. Offered in two, four, and six ounce pours, the drink was a Shafer syrah which is a unique wine to pour by the glass. The snack was cheese with grilled toast points. The truffle tremor goat and buttermilk blue cheeses were both nice selections. The toast points were burnt. I really have to question a kitchen that doesn't know how to make toast. The snack could have included charcuterie if something other than Creminelli cured meats from Utah (I'm not a fan) was offered.	3	La Cave Wine and Food Hideaway	4
"Perhaps I waited too long to come here because the food seemed too classical and not daring. Granted, chef Julian Serrano's award-winning restaurant is nearly 20-years-old and I did try to visit in 2001, but was told the restaurant was closed for a private event. Not that the food was bad or dated, but it took time for me to adjust to the traditional French refinement instead of bold creativity. When sitting down to eat at Picasso, think ""attention to detail"" to get into the right mindset and ask after every bite, ""Can I taste the essence of each ingredient?""

The cooking is not about big flavors, but subtle clarity and detailed execution. I imagine that the kitchen is filled with immersion circulators to cook the food to the exact degree. Vegetables like innocent little carrots that were precisely between crunchy and soft or beets just tender enough to cut through, but not more.

The flavor profiles were not about unique or clever ingredient mash-ups, but traditional combinations like foie gras with apple or veal with potato. Even when straying from French into German cuisine, the deer loin was served with a tangy red cabbage slaw.

This is not fatty French cooking where butter and cream are the main ingredients. Fats coat the palate which block the ability to taste the spirit of each ingredient. The asparagus and morels came with a cream sauce, but it was very thin instead of heavy which allowed the vegetables and mushrooms to shine. The spring pea soup was more like a pea broth than a thick veloute - again to let the pea flavor become the center of attention. Even the dressing on the warm quail salad was fantastically light instead of heavy with oil.

Instead of dislocating a shoulder while hoisting the enormous wine book, I opted for one of the two convenient wine pairings (the cheaper $63 version) for the three savory courses. The pairing was a journey around the world with great explanations by the sommelier. The conservative pairings were consistently light compared to the food. The approach is the wine should be subordinate to the food. Boldness was neither for the food nor the wine.

Although the waiter was flippantly confident that our 7:00P reservation would allow plenty of time for a 9:30P curtain of ""O"", he was wrong. We arrived at the show on time, but had to rush through the petit fours and hustle through the casino.

The dining room was decorated with not just one Picasso painting, but many works using different mediums. Probably not a seat in the house that didn't have at least two Picassos in view. The one wall without artwork was the glass doors with a view of the dancing Bellagio fountains.

The attire is dressy with jacket preferred, but good luck enforcing that in Las Vegas. It's too bad. There are only a few times when playing ""dress up"" is encouraged - prom, red carpet events, and Vegas. Seize the opportunity instead of being too (casually) cool for school.

The restaurant is located downstairs from where the shopping area and the casino connect. Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Prime Steakhouse is next door. The simplest menu selection was four-courses for $118 with three to six different selections per course.

On my next visit to Vegas, I hope to slip into the bar for barrel-aged cocktails while gazing, not into my girlfriend's eyes, but at the large Picasso painting. Hey, she'd do the same thing."	4	Picasso	4.5
"At $22 or $17 for a burger and fries, I was expecting a great burger, not merely a good burger.

The ""Hubert Keller"" buffalo burger came with a tasty red wine reduction sauce, but the burger already soaked through the rustic ciabatta bun and made it impossible to add without completely disintegrating the bun. The burger also came with grilled onions and cooked spinach which were flavorful, but there were too much of them. Because of the toppings, the Keller burger had nice flavors that are atypical of a burger. It reminded me of a French dip sandwich more than a burger which isn't necessarily bad.

The Keller burger was better than the ""Blackjack"" burger. The Blackjack burger was too small to fit the ciabatta bun. The key flavor of the burger was the olive tapenade and also had jack cheese. Lettuce, red onion, and sliced tomato are on the side which I added to the burger, but should I really need to assemble my own meal? A pickle is also on the side, but it's a spear, not sliced. Good luck putting that on your burger. It's questionable if the pickle was house made or bought from a purveyor.

The kitchen had trouble with their cooking temps. The medium-ordered buffalo burger was medium-rare. The rare angus burger was unevenly cooked with one-half medium-rare and some parts medium. Whatever beef blend they are using, it didn't bring out the flavor of the meat.

Although called ""skinny"" fries on the menu, they are classic-cut bistro fries, not shoestring skinny. The fries had a thick crust which reduced the inner potato fluffiness, but they were less greasy than most.

I was a bit shocked that a Hubert Keller restaurant would staff and dress their waitresses like a Hooters. The waitresses clearly don't eat the burgers here.

During a slow time of year in Vegas, the restaurant was busy and required a 10 minute wait to get a table. Even though this is a burger bar, many customers had salads for lunch. The online sample menu is woefully small compared to the real menu with an endless number of choices including the ability to add truffles to any burger. Because these casino resorts are a Byzantine maze, the restaurant can be found in the Mandalay Bay Place shopping area."	3	Burger Bar	4
"When my voluptuous girlfriend said we were getting pasties in Las Vegas, I titillatingly thought, ""Ohhhh, I hope they are the ones with tassels."" As we drove into the seedy and run-down Village Square shopping area, going past the Lotus of Siam, the hunt for pasties was on. Then oops, we walk into the dark and junky interior of a bar. The pasties were really English bar food and similar to a Wellington or a meat hand pie.

""The Oogie"" pasty had potatoes, onions, rutabagas, and unevenly distributed beef. My favorite filling was the rutabaga which added a different dimension. As a pot pie prostitute, I loved the thick and hearty crust. The super beefy gravy on the side was also very good. Even though I love lamb, the lamb and mint version had a strange taste that I couldn't pinpoint. I couldn't eat it.

When I first saw a photo of a Scotch egg, I immediately wanted to try one. Just seeing a runny yellow yolk spilling over the fried sausage began my elusive hunt. I found it here, but they used a hard boiled egg that was cold. The egg was served on a salad with honey mustard dressing on the side. This dish seemed oddly like institutional food, but that might make sense because that would describe most English food."	3	Cornish Pasty	4.5
There are many burger places in LV but this one stands out. Their burgers are thick and juicy and come with a lot of different toppings and options. If you are gluten free, they have a GF bun or can wrap a patty in lettuce. Beware, the fries may not be GF since they share a fryer with other non-GF items. They also serve popcorn in lieu of a bread basket which I think is an interesting touch. Shakes looked amazing but I was too full to try one. The decor is super cute and fun.	4	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4
"This place is swanky\/trendy so prepare to spend some serious $$. It overlooks the Bellagio fountains which is pretty cool. 
The service is extremely well-trained and professional. 
We started off not ordering drinks but felt kind of funny, almost like it was *expected* we order a cocktail. If you're concerned about the cost, just don't go here. We sucked it up and ordered 2 drinks (cocktail was $18, wine was $15). 
We started with the raw tuna appetizer with caviar, granny smith apples and truffle crema. It was delicious. It comes with 4 pieces and because we split it, they put 2 each on separate plates which was a nice touch. 
Also, to note, the bread basket is insanely good. They bring a few different types and serve it with citrus olive oil, whipped mascarpone with sea salt and a tapenade. 
I had the duck and foie gras ravioli. I did enjoy them but they were a little one note. Perhaps they could have been a little heavier handed with the balsamic drizzle for a more complex flavor? I also was pretty full at that point after eating half the bread basket. I did wrap the rest to go and they tasted really great heated the next day. 
My bf had the $55 steak which he really enjoyed but didn't understand why it was worth $55.
We finished the meal with the chocolate parfait since it was the only gluten free dessert option. It was fine. Pretty light and refreshing. 
Overall we enjoyed our experience once we got over the $$ aspect. It cost $200 for 2 people. Definitely check this place out if you are gluten free since they have many GF options. Just ask your waiter for the GF menu when you're seated. They are very accommodating."	4	Scarpetta	4
Amazing shakes! A wide variety of flavors with a bunch of different mix-ins and they're all delicious. I slurped my Oreo shake down in 5 mins flat. Didn't have a burger or fries but they seemed good to by the looks of it.	4	Steak 'n Shake	3.5
This place does breakfast 24 hours a day which is so absolutely wonderful! There are a ton of options and the menu is clearly marked for items that are gluten free. There are a good amount of GF items to choose from. I got the cheddar bacon grits and they were okay. A bit watery and the cheese is served on the side so when you dump it in, it doesn't really integrate itself 100%. I also got a side of 1 pancake (I love when places give you that option!) and it was delicious and giant. Word to the wise....the tall stack of pancakes is humongous. The short stack also is pretty huge. I would honestly just order 1 pancake off the side menu (it's the size of an entire plate) and add on bacon\/sausage\/homefries, etc. Otherwise it's really just too much pancake for a single human to consume.	3	Planet Dailies	3
We came with a free meal voucher from Hilton for sitting through one of their awful timeshare pitches. With the voucher you get a free entree or for $10 upgrade to the rodizio which is unlimited roasted meat. If you have this kind of deal, I highly recommend the rodizio. The waiters constantly come around with huge skewers of meat and cut fresh pieces off for you at your table. There's a good selection of sirloin, chicken, pork and even pineapple. It's a great deal if you're hungry and the food is solid (although I wouldn't say it's amazing). You also have unlimited access to the salad bar and the sides including vegetables,rice, mashed potatoes, Brazilian cheese bread, etc. It's definitely pricey without some sort of deal but if you are good at buffets, then it might be worth it.	3	Pampas Churrascaria Brazilian Grille	3
This is by far my favorite buffet in LV. We liked it so much, we went two days in a row. The food served here is definitely unique and thoughtfully prepared. It's not your typical buffet food served out of troughs. It's more of a tapas style buffet- you take small individual dishes that are beautifully plated. There is so much to choose from with many healthy options. Also if you have a gluten allergy, the chef will walk around with you pointing out which dishes are gluten free. The sushi rolls were stand outs to me, as were the crab legs, roasted bone marrow and the desserts (gelato, red velvet cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, etc.) This place is good for breakfast or dinner but I would recommend going at an off time since the lines can get kind of long.	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"Wow! This place has huge serving. We came here for lunch on a Saturday where there's a lot of people but only waited about 20mins. So I ordered the Caramel Overload Iced Coffee I think it was called, which was THE BOMB! If you love iced sweet coffee then you'll love this. Then I ordered the Chicken & Waffle which costs about $18 and I was surprised how huge it was! It's an art on a plate and at the same time, it was really good! The chicken was the bomb but the waffles are just okay. The serving was actually for two people. I got tired didn't even finish half of it so took it to-go then ate it later on. Lol. My boyfriend got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which I think was featured on the Man Vs Food show. He loved it but it's the first time in his lifetime that he wasn't able to finish his food not because it wasnt good but because its a HUGE serving. He's a big eater & a big guy so just imagine how big it was. Lol

The service was really good, staff are very friendly and nice. Place looks pretty cool, neat, casual, nothing fancy. Will definitely come back when we visit Vegas again!"	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
First thought when I got my food was.. this is it? But after I tasted the food it's great and it should probably be the portions we should be eating opposed to the feeds 3 dishes everywhere else. Their cluck-moo was amazing!	4	SkinnyFATS	4.5
I grew up with this California-based chain.  For me, a polish sandwich with kraut is comfort food.  I have to eat here at least once every couple of weeks.  You should to.  Interestingly enough: you can buy a chili dog, a chili cheese dog, a chili burger, a chili cheese burger, but you can't buy a bowl of chili.	5	Wienerschnitzel	3
Not too bad for sushi.  The nigri and rolls are very good, and the prices are reasonable.  We were there with friends and the staff was attentive without being cloying.  We'll be back.	3	Sushi Kaya	3.5
Went for dinner and food was very good! Definitely worth getting all you can eat to taste all the different rolls they have to offer. My husband also ordered the honey toast, which was amazing!	4	Sushi Bomb	4
I ate here the other day while passing through town. I have eaten at other Grimaldi's including the original in NY. This might be the best Pizza West of NY! I grew up in Boston and lived in NY. I know the difference between "great" and "good" pizza. If "Great" is what you seek, this is the place. In addition to the awesome pie, the service is very good. Super nice people. Wish they would open one up in SoCal!	5	Grimaldi's Pizzeria	4
A great buffet that offers a nice variety. Not only was the seafood very good, I was also happy with the non-seafood offerings too. The raw bar was great, and the sushi -- though not comparable to most sushi bars -- was good enough to make it worth your while. Finally, if you like Cajun, Chinese, or New England seafood, the Rio offers a wide assortment of flavors. In fact, the biggest problem is trying them all in one sitting. Advise you come hungry and take small portions if you want to sample everything.	4	Village Seafood Buffet	3.5

so good for a vegas buffet. =)  

ETA:  we did brunch"	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
A la mode was able to take an order for me less than a week away from my event and deliver a delicious cake more beautiful than I could have imagined! They also dealt with my crazed nervous emails gracefully and quickly responding to assure me everything would be fine. And it was. Just amazing to have a bakery able to offer gluten free and dairy free deliciousness. I'm so glad you exist! Thank you!	5	A La Mode	4.5
"Stepped in the spot and figured alright dope. Murals as everyone says. The pictures looked great from what everyone posted. Disappointed that I have interest in the 3rd eye and coffee yet... you walk in and it smells like nothing. People say there's a secret to this place and the secret is they don't serve coffee. Long story short. 

Staring at the menu then two ladies greet my girlfriend and I which was nice. Then that was the end of any further exchanging words. Nothing was recommended,  no questions of preferred coffee. Seems to have little knowledge of coffee. Not that I'm a master myself still... promote something enlighten customers. Ordered our drinks and I don't even remember what it was.

We sat at the pac man table area. I was taking notice of all the eye catching things. Chess, art, books, and one of those long tables which soon after I took notice a group occupied the table. They seemed very interest in a lot of things and trying to adapt as much as they could.(I'll get back to this later.)

Well we received our drinks my girlfriend took one sip of her drink and that was it. She put hers down and I tried drinking mine and finishing hers not wanting to be rude. But hers was pure sugar no coffee. You can tell by looking at it there was no coffee. That's all I can say about our drinks. 

Now going back at the group.  They admired all the things I mentioned above then they got their drinks. Wasn't impressed. You can also hear them say not much of coffee. They then ask about the WiFi and the worker comes over to advise it should be working. Gentleman says the connection is limited and she says no it shouldn't be. Walks off shaking her head and the group was left WiFi-less and disappointed. They mumbled other things that could have been better.. haven't seen a review from them yet.. but that sparked my interest to post mine.

Pros: looks dope.
Cons: no coffee, no\/bad WiFi connection, okay atmosphere."	1	Illumilatte Brew Society	4
"So anyone in Vegas understands this is a perfect spot for late nights. Do not go there on a Thursday night. I just had definitely one of the worst experiences there. 

You can tell how they divided the tables and one side were the drunk leftovers from the club. The smaller side were just regular people ready to dine. I went there after picking my girlfriends mom up from her late swing shift. We get there around 4 AM. No crowd but the security guard actually seats us which was fine. 

We sit down and were given menus. My girlfriends mom waves to her coworker that also just got off work. We were finally given some water and looking at the menu and after about 10 minutes we are finally asked if we're ready and sadly we weren't. So he said ""Okay"" no customer service with a take your time yadiyadiya... just left. Then comes this solo diner that sits next to us. After about 5 minutes of him waiting he was upset and walked over to the security guard. Security guards asked if he would like to start with appetizers. Guy replies ""no I just want to order, number 13"" blam.  Done deal. He places the order and security guard comes back to us asking if We'd like ""fast"" appetizers and sorry for the wait because they're back up... which is believable but.. I know for a fact they weren't. The same guys that were ready to take our order saw us. We figured okay maybe they think we're still pondering our great options at pho kim long. No we want pho homie. It's simple. Surpringly our spring rolls came out just minutes after ordering. At the same time our solo diner already had his food but tells the server ""you guys forgot my drink and napkin"".. they didn't apologize because they knew they didn't want to serve him as it seemed he was a ""regular""

We sat there with our empty plates and half empty glasses of water. The guy who supposedly wanted to take our order then starts to clean up the table that was next to ours and the girlfriends mothers coworkers said a peep and he walked over, placed there order. Right after that the solo diner was done he paid and left. Before we even had a chance to order. The guy cleans up and another guy basically asked how much and he said zero. And the employees seemed a bit off.

Now everything was cool it seemed fine until after our meal. Sure I can understand horrible service for people who always have to deal with drunk leftovers from the club... but you sat us on a side with regular people just waiting to dine. We asked for a to go box and the check. I work in the tipping industry and understand we should tip. At least. As for restaurant tipping I truly believe that is based on the customer service we received.. I felt like we didn't get any.. so do they deserve any? Sure. I gave them 3 dollars. I felt generous. I usually double the tax but for this I kept it as is. 

I walk up to the cashier and pay with card. He rips off the first receipt and says it very bluntly ""choose one"" and circles the tipping options and stares at me. I say ""no thank you I already tipped you cash."" So he immediately steps back and calls on the ""radio"" which was clipped to his shirt but says very loudly where the restaurant can hear ""get the money from table 6"" and the guy responds ""Okay I got It"" cashier responds ""What?"" And no longer using their little walkie talkies they said 3. And everyone was like ""THREE?!"" I didn't realize it at the time because I spent an hour waiting for food it was 5 am. I was tired and ready to go home. It was just completely rude. 

If they wanted a generous tip they should have given top notch customer service to sober people versus kissing ass to a bunch of drunk idiots who more than likely gave them a stiff. It's a common spot to go here and I've never experienced customer service like this before. Only quality thing they had there was security.. so if you want late night food\/pho with a high chance to see a fight(why else is there a security guard at a restaurant) go to pho kim long.

Smh."	1	Pho Kim Long	3.5
"Growing up in San Diego in the 1970's meant Mickey D's, Jacks, BK, KY Fry, DW, and if I was good, Carl's Jr.  A Super Star with Cheese, Criss-Cut Fries and a drink was a treat.

It still is.  With all the choices in fast food burgers, Carl's is still one of the chains at the top of my list.  As a matter of fact, I think it sounds good for dinner tonight on my way to DeMolay."	4	Carl's Jr.	2.5
"I'm leaving 5 stars because JEN at the bar is amazing. The kitchen was backed up she was completely honest with us. So we sat and drank had a great time then ate. 

She made the best drink for me. I ended up ordering four of them. :) thank you!"	5	Ketchup Premium Burger Bar	3
An outstanding beer selection on draught and an excellent menu bring this hole in the wall from the outstanding to the sublime.  Try the mac & cheese.	5	Aces & Ales	4
I ate here five years or so ago and it wasn't the worst slophouse in Vegas, but it was close.  It's gone up a notch or so, but I'd still rather go to Bellagio or Wynn if I absolutely must stay on the strip.  Best in town (IMHO) is GVR.	2	Flavors The Buffet	3
Great gyros, but the lamb and rice is to die for. Prices are reasonable and the service is great.	4	Kabob Express	4.5
"I love the idea of Korean-Mexican fusion.  But, I don't know if we went there on a bad day, or they paid Guy Fieri a ton to hawk their place, but I wasn't impressed.  I ordered the bulgogi burrito and Jamie had the bulgogi plate.  The meat was dry, and I had to ask for kimchi on the side.  Korean restaurant, kimchi ON THE SIDE???  There should have been kimchi IN everything.

Sorry, folks, I'm not going back."	1	KoMex Fusion	4.5
"Oh wow!  Where do I begin?  This place was recommended to me by a Chinese brother who lives in LA.  He wasn't wrong.  Szechuan doesn't always mean spicy, although some of what they serve will peel the paint off the walls.  Heat without flavor is just an exercise in pain control.

Oh yes, there is heat aplenty, but there's also a deep flavor underlying the heat.  We started with the Yunnan noodle soup.  It was a clear broth, but very flavorful, and a good beginning to what came next.  At my Brother's recommendation, we ordered the boiled fish and beef in sauce (piquant), the Chongqing Spicy Chicken (it's a popcorn chicken style with deep fried chilis), and the green beans.  I was sweating by the time I was done, but what we took home was gone within 10 minutes of getting home by our son.

Oh yes, the place is only about the size of a postage stamp, and we had to sit at a round table with two other groups.  We were also the only ones in the place using English menus, if that tells you something.

I will not go to any other Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas again if I can help it."	5	Yunnan Garden	3.5
This is the best seafood place in Vegas.  Period.  End of discussion.  End of review.	5	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
Del Taco is the second faux-Mexican aberration to come out of California (behind Taco Bell).  Being a transplanted Californian in Las Vegas, I'll go out of my way for Roberto's.  That being said, it'll do in a pinch.	3	Del Taco	2.5
The original and the best seafood in Vegas. Bring gloves, because you're going to get sauce on your hands and all over the place.	5	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
Oh wow.  Where do I start?  Let's start with the bistro in the back, with great sandwiches on freshly baked baguettes and the best French onion soup in town.  Then there's the pastries in the front.  This is the place where all the faux-French places in town get their pastries and desserts.  All I can say is Yum!	5	Patisserie Manon	4
"I first came here about four years ago.  The manager was the brother of a dealer I worked with at GVR.  A group of us from GVR went there after work and were treated to a fantastic meal.

The food hasn't changed.  It's till delicious and very reasonably priced.  The calamari appetizer is an absolute must, and the small bowls of pho are enough to feed two people.

Good food, good price.  Go."	4	Pho Kim Long	3.5
In a town full of mom and pop taco shops, this is one of them.  Not that it's bad, mind you; it's just not all that different.  The food is good and the prices are reasonable, but it's nothing special.	2	Pepe's Tacos	2.5
Oh, wow.  Where do I start?  One of my friends brought me here.  It's in the old Ragin' Cajun, but it's nothing like that.  The menu is only what I can call "Asian Eclectic."  I had the whole Maine lobster pho, my friend had the razor clams in lemongrass and Thai basil.  The staff are great and the service is fantastic.  To quote a TV show I like, "You Gotta Eat Here.	5	District One	4
We've tried every place Guy Fieri has recommended in Vegas, and as far as we're concerned, he's 3\/4.  The only place he got wrong was Lotus of Siam (It sucks).  This place is great.  The food is wonderful and the service is quick and attentive.  I had the Bronzed Shrimp and Grits, and my wife had the shrimp platter with the shrimp blackened.  We also had the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding for dessert.  The only criticism was Jamie said her shrimp were too salty.  I could have eaten two bowls of the grits.  It's inspired me to try to make it myself.  I don't think I'll be able to do it, but I'll give it a go.	4	Lola's A Louisana Kitchen	4
I had the two meat combo with beans and slaw.  The brisket was dry and the hot links weren't.  They did have never-ending pickles and soda.  I'll stay with Famous Daves or John Mull's.	2	Dickey's Barbecue Pit	3.5
I love Mediterranean food, and this is some of the best I've had in Las Vegas.  Prices are reasonable.  I had the lamb kebab.  It came with Basmati rice, a Greek salad, and grilled tomatoes and onions.  I also had rice pudding for dessert.  Wow!	4	Market Grille Cafe	4
Oh, wow.  Where to start?  This is a Las Vegas institution.  When I was a dealer at the old Sahara, we used to go here after work at 3:00 AM for an omelet and champagne.  The fireside lounge is kitchy, old-school Vegas, but the bar staff are great and the mixologists build great drinks.  Oh, and did I mention the food is tasty, reasonably priced, and there's a lot of it?  If you're on the strip and need a good meal at a good price, or you want to sit back and relax in a nice lounge and enjoy a beverage, this is THE place to go.	5	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
Simply, the best Lao and Thai food on the East side. Comparable to Thai Style Noodle House.	5	Lao Thai Kitchen	4
This place needs very little in the way of a review.  Delicious, decadent, everything your doctor says you shouldn't eat.  But you will anyway.  Several times. Whenever you can.	5	Five Guys	4
I've always liked Fuddruckers.  The burgers are cooked to order and the toppings are fresh.  Shame it's in the Orleans and I live behind Nellis.	4	Fuddruckers	3
This is the best Thai place in Vegas.  Period.  End of sentence.  I've been all over country, from Udorn to Hatyai, and this place is just good old fashioned Thai home cooking and Bangkok street food.  I don't know where Food Network get off on Lotus of Siam (worst in town).	5	Thai Style Noodle House	4
Cap's is the best sub shop in town, bar none.  Fresh, fast, and friendly.  Don't forget to tip beer money, these folks deserve it.	5	Capriotti's Sandwich Shop	3.5
Al's is classic Chicago.  We went two days after they opened, and the sandwich was just OK.  I'm sure it'll get better as the staff gain experience.	2	Al's Beef	3.5
This is one of the best places on the East side, and possibly in Vegas.  Not only is everything fresh, but they deliver (www.eat24hours.com).  Not only pizza, but pasta, wings, and Italian dinners.  Great prices.	4	Napoli Pizza	3
"I had been talking with someone at work last week, and they suggested this a a great place for an inexpensive, great-tasting pizza.  So we sallied forth, infiltrated the place of purveyance and negotiated the vending of some combustibles.

In a word: average.  In several words: the pizza was alright, the cheesy bread was good, and the hot wings were OK.  Maybe we got there on a bad night (it WAS 110 degrees at 6:PM), so I don't know.

All in all though, I'll still go to Napoli."	2	Tropicana Pizza	3.5
Old school Vegas at it's best.  This place is arguably the best Italian food in town.  I had the Eggplant de Amore with a side of meatballs.  Both were perfectly cooked and incredible.  It's a bit pricey, but well worth it for a special night out.	5	Casa Di Amore	4.5
Quick down and dirty: Good tasting Chinese food, good prices, close to home, and they deliver.  It's not Wing Lei, but it'll do in a pinch.	3	China A Go Go	3.5
MCB is one of the best BBQ places in town.  I say "one of the best" because I sometimes find that the meat can be dry.  The beans, cole slaw and fried pickles are to die for, though.	4	Memphis Championship Barbecue	3
Good, solid Chinese food served fast at a good price.  Lunch specials are a good value.	3	China A Go Go	3.5
Who ever looks for a Chinese restaurant inside a locals dive casino?  Well, here's one.  The Baos are great, as are the rice bowls.  Oh, and you have to get an eclaire for dessert.	4	Fat Choy	4
Simply put: one of the best bowls of pho you'll get in Vegas.	4	Pho Vietnam Restaurant	3
A Glatt Kosher (Chabad) restaurant is such a find in Vegas, especially when the food is great, the service is exceptional, and they know what a bencher is.  It's a bit pricey, but well worth the cost for the quality, taste, and amount of food you get.	4	Jerusalem Grill & Bar	4
Just another dark, smoky local place.  Went there for a friend's 90th birthday.	2	Arizona Charlie's Decatur	2.5
So, today I took the missus for my Father's Day brunch.  I ordered the #1: three pieces of chicken, two waffles, two eggs, grits.  The missus had the breast and waffle combo.  We also got the fried gizzards, okra, and catfish appetizers.  It was all good.  Hint: if you like Hush Puppy's catfish, come here.  You won't go to Hush Puppy's any more.	4	Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles	3
"Let me start by saying that I had their weekday buffet lunch about eight years ago and I wasn't impressed.  Either they shot the chef at that time, or they decided to start serving authentic Thai food, I don't know.  Either way, they deliver seriously good Thai food through eat24hours.com.  I think I've mentioned before that I spend quite a bit of time in Thailand, and I really love Thai food; HOT Thai food; AUTHENTIC Thai food.  This time, we ordered Pahd See Ew Gai (chicken noodles), Khao Pahd Gai (chicken fried rice), red chicken curry, and papaya salad with sticky rice.  Foodgasm!  The fried rice and noodles are going to be lunch next week, the rest will be gone by tomorrow.

If you live on the east side and are too lazy\/tired\/drunk to get to Pon Ocha Soup, get on eat24hours.com and order from this place."	4	Thai Cuisine	4
All I can say is WOW!.  I lived in Okinawa for seven years and this is as good or better than anything I had in Japan.  The menu is very thorough, the prices are reasonable, and the fact it's less than $30.00 AYCE made while you wait and always fresh makes this the best place in town.	5	Yama Sushi	4
Palace Station is the first of the Stations Casinos chain, and it shows.  It's smoky, dark, and the food is only passable. The upside is the rooms are relatively cheap and it's close to the strip.	2	Palace Station Hotel & Casino	2.5
My mother and brother were born and raised in Chicago, and I love Chicago-style food.  Until now, I'd not found a good place in Vegas to get an Italian beef sandwich or a real Chicago dog.  I have now.  They even have all the fixin's for sale, including the Vienna Beef hot dogs, sport peppers, and giardinare.  Forget about Al's, come here.  They also have another location where they serve Chicago pizza, but I've not tried them (yet).  But I promise I will.	5	Windy City Beefs N Dogs	4.5
Oh wow.  How do I describe this place?  I've always said that any ethnic restaurant where people of that ethnicity fill the place must be either good or they pay a lot of people to sit in the window.  IN this case, it's the former.  I went with an Indian friend and she was in heaven.  I've been to India a couple of times and the food here is as good as anything I had there.  Prices are reasonable.  Warning: if you order the Inferno curry, the waiver isn't a joke.  This curry is made with pure Ghost Peppers and it will take a half-gallon of lasse to cool the burn, but it's delicious once the burn subsides.  I loved it.   In one word: go.	5	Mint Indian Bistro	4
Adequate.  The free Thai tea for my first Yelp check-in was nice.  The panang-gai wasn't spicy at all and was a bit bland.  The rice didn't smell or taste like jasmine rice.  I'll try again and let you know.	2	Sakun Thai	3.5
A real Irish pub serving great food and drinks.  Ask for the Irish breakfast and you won't be disappointed.	5	McMullan's Irish Pub	4
"Let's get this straight: almost all the best restaurants in Vegas are in Chinatown, and most of those are within two blocks of the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn.  Thai-Style Noodle House, Pho Vietnam, Hot and Juicy Crawfish, Yunnan Garden, Hawaiian-Style Poke, and of course the 99 Ranch Market are right there.  Sura Korean BBQ and Cathay House are just a few blocks farther down.

If you're looking for a fast and tasty sandwich in the Chinatown area, this is the place.  get the Asian sandwich.  Make it a combo with spring rolls and a soda."	4	Lee's Sandwiches	3
OK, let's get this straight: In my 26 years in the Air Force, I spent almost half of my career overseas.  About half of that was spent in Okinawa, and we were TDY to Thailand almost half of that.  I could speak passable Thai at one time, and even though my accent now is terrible (Thai is a tonal language, so accent and inflection are essential) when I don't even look a the menu and order in Thai, I expect something authentic.  I ordered papaya salad with sticky rice and pahd see yew.  Both came out bland, and the Nam Phrik had jalapenos and not ki noo peppers.  Lotus of Siam made this same mistake.  I won't go back to either unless I'm desperate.  If you want real, authentic Thai street food, hit Thai-Style Noodle House on the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn or Pon Ocha Soup on Nellis and Stewart.	2	Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant	4
I don't see where the negative reviews are coming from.  I ordered the burger with brie and bacon, my wife ordered it with foie gras and bacon, and my son had the lamb burger.  We sided it with the fried pickles and both the Parmesan\/garlic and the truffle fries.  We all like our burgers medium rare, and they all came out perfectly cooked and very tasty.	4	Burger Bistro	2.5
This has always been one of my favorite places in town, despite all the bad press.  The food has always been great, the service wonderful, and the 3-day marinated sangria (as well as the pitchers of mojitos) goes down WAY too smoothly.	5	Firefly	4.5
"I love churrasco.  I love this place.  The problem I always have is that I tend to fill up on the salad bar (a misnomer if ever there was one) before the carnivore kicks in.

The salad bar is more an antipasti bar: salumi, cheeses, roasted and pickled vegetables, and a lobster bisque that will have you wanting it IV.  Oh, and there are salads as well.

The meats are roasted perfectly, and there's plenty to go around.  I am a fan of lamb, and when they come out with not only roast leg but also chops, I'm in heaven.

I just wish I (or I'm glad I don't) live closer.  It's in the Town Square, and I live in Sunrise Manor, so it's a 45 minute drive; but it's well worth the drive."	5	Texas de Brazil	4.5
A hole in the wall taco shop on the east side, but they're open 24 hours and the food is goo, hot, fast, and relatively inexpensive.  Great place for Taco Tuesday.	4	Viva El Taco	3.5
When I retired from the Air Force, we had my retirement dinner here.  This is where I bring my out of town friends when I want to impress them.  Casual atmosphere, great food, 3-day marinated sangria, great prices. Just take your time and enjoy. Make reservations through Urbanspoon for dining points.	5	Firefly	4.5
I've been to Medieval Times on quite a few occasions, and this dinner show is similar. The difference is this show has the Vegas touch.  Honestly, the food is just north of average for a Vegas venue, but the show more than makes up for it.  The service is also excellent, the drinks are huge, and management has cultivated a family atmosphere among the employees; they seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs and have fun doing it.  We'll be going back again.	4	Tournament of Kings	4
Since Big Dog's went away, this has been our watering hole.  Good grub and drinks in a clean atmosphere.	4	PT's	3.5
This is not a restaurant, it's a meat market with prepared foods and a place outside to (pardon the pun) pig out.  It's located in NW Vegas, in a residential part of town.  If you're looking for a MCB or Famous Dave's kind of place, this isn't it.  The only thing you'll find here is down-home BBQ and a meat counter, both with excellent value for the money.  Couple this with a staff that treats you like you're family and you have one heck of an experience.  Where else are you going to find side pork, frog legs and goat?	5	John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill	4.5
We went here before seeing Raiding the Rock Vault.  Good, solid noodle dishes at affordable prices, plus 25% off for locals with player's card.	4	888 Noodle Bar	3
"I love Russian food.  To me, it's soul food.  I was raised in an Eastern-European family, and my mother cooked Russian and Polish food.

Everything we had was hot, fresh, and as good as anything I have had in Russia or any of the old Soviet republics.  I was in Turkmenistan eight years ago, and the shashlik was as good as anything in Ashgabat.

They also make their own infused vodkas.  Saturday night is live Russian entertainment.  We will be going back at least once every couple of weeks.  I'll see you there.    !"	5	Cafe Mayakovsky	4.5
To be honest, the only thing this place has for their breakfast buffet that I liked was the omelet bar.  The rest was mediocre at best.  If you want a great buffet in Vegas, go across the street to the Wynn.	2	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
Great selection of beers and good pub grub.  Only wish I lived closer.	4	Yard House	4
Anyplace that serves margaritas in pint mugs is great in my book.  Besides the fact that the food is delicious and reasonably priced, this really is a great sit-down Mexican place on the East side.  There's also a great Mexican bakery next door.  Make the drive, you won't be disappointed.	4	Maria's Mexican Restaurant & Bakery	4.5
Let me start by saying that any sushi place that has Orion beer from Okinawa and an Anglo making sushi can't be all bad.  The rolls are delicious and reasonably priced.  The chefs know their stuff and could make even taco taste good.  Try the salmon skin salad and the Toro sushi or sashimi.  And of course, the Orion beer.	4	Yummy Grill & Sushi	4.5
Just as good as the original, but larger.  No two-hour wait this time.  Best seafood in Vegas.	4	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
I've never before had a burger and fries that I've had to excuse myself from the table and go to the bathroom to clean myself off after the foodgasm.	5	Bachi Burger	4
Memphis Championship BBQ can be dry, but Famous Dave's is always juicy, fresh and fast.  The only place that comes close is John Mull's Meats.	4	Famous Dave's Bar-B-Que	3.5
It's not worth the money.  The burgers are ok, not amazing.  The Alma's Mac salad was extremely dry and the fries are just fries.  All this hype for what...terrible service and ok good.	3	Wahlburgers	3.5
By far the worst place I have eaten at I Vegas. The food was microwaved, not fresh, and disgusting. This place is know for their artichokes. Let me tell you that my 12 year old can make a better artichoke. I do not recommend eating here.	1	Chicago Joe's	4
"Food was absolutely delicious. Their service was marvelous and the view from our table was simply magnificent. We went here for our Christmas dinner and had our table near the patio glass wall. We could view the bellagio fountain, the Eiffel tower from there. 

Okay so food wise, I loved the gnocchi. And definitely try their free appetizer place of olives and bread. Its really tasty and quite unique."	5	Olives	4
We are in Vegas for my sister's wedding and decided to try as many vegan spots as we could while here. We tried Pancho's tacos and this place is so good! Their food portions are HUGE and so affordable! Would definitely recommend it!	5	Pancho's Vegan Tacos	4.5
I give this place 4 stars for the food and two stars for location, maybe even one!  You can get a taxi to get there, but it's almost a miracle to get one to come back and get you.  The food is great.  Authentic cuban food.  I have been here 3 times and each time the food was wonderful.  Everyone in our group, no matter what they ordered, was happy with their food.  It may be the only great deal in Vegas.	4	Florida Cafe Cuban Bar & Grill	3.5
"StripBurger was great! 

Ambience: We ate outside on the patio around 11pm. It was warm but a nice breeze. There was a DJ playing and a few dancers. 

Food: amazing for a fast food type of place and very fairly priced! Surprising for Vegas. My husband had the dried Angus burger & I had the mushroom Swiss. Both excellent! Ask for ranch with your fries! $2 beers at happy hour too. 

Service: our waiter was really great!"	4	Stripburger	4
Hidden gem of Vegas. Great food, cheap prices, good vibe and music. First class sriously. Close by parking can bring your own beer\/win they don't have licence yet I guess.	5	Thai St Cafe	4
Very great place to eat at, my group of friends and I always come here after a night out and they tolerate us being loud, and having fun! Only down side is when you try to go around dinner time. It's usually a pretty lengthy wait upwards to 20-30 minutes.	5	Pho Kim Long	3.5
Very nice staff, great food and pretty fair prices! I come at least once a month. I do think they can use a little bit more "privacy" I don't like sitting next to strangers while enjoying a dinner with my friends. Kinda feels a little awkward when the strangers you're sitting next to is filming you catching food in your mouth.	5	Ohjah Noodle House	4.5
Good food but not for a wait time of more than 30 minutes each visit. The owners or holding officers of JINYA needs to realize they don't have enough tables or space for their business and start thinking it's time to expand into a much larger place.	1	JINYA Ramen Bar	4
Ate there first and last time I will ever eat there. I'm all for giving new small businesses a chance but never again will I give this place a chance no one wore gloves and hair nets I ended up pulling out a hair out of my food I myself have short hair not medium length brown hair.  Worst part was I already ate almost 2 slices before finding it.	1	Joe Philly's Pizza	3.5
This place is mainly for Spanish speakers I tried to call and all the lady would say is si or no I said what time do you close she said no I went in to order food and the cashier ordered me something completely different NOT going back.	1	Pepe's Tacos	3.5
This buffet is truly as good as it gets. I haven't been to many Vegas buffets but this place set the bar very high. They have literally anything you can think of and all the food is of very good quality. I was especially impressed with the dessert selection. Top notch!!	5	The Buffet	3.5
The food here was great!! We were a big fan of the trash can nachos. Prices are a bit high for what you get. Service seemed overwhelmed with a party of 7. Overall, I would give it another try but maybe next time with a smaller group or at a less busy time of day.	3	Guy Fieri's El Burro Borracho	3.5
The view is about the only thing this place has going for it. Extremely high prices for extremely small portions. Average (bite sized) portion is $20 and the waiter recommends you order three plates each!! Honestly, you would probably need to order about 5 plates to be satisfied. I will be watching from the other side of the fountains next time and save myself the small fortune it costs to eat at this up tight establishment.	2	Lago	4
Just had the mush\/Swiss burger ugh! What a disappointment not enough mushrooms and the meat was well done when I asked for med rare. The bun that was suppose to be toasted was burnt, the only thing this place has going for it is the pizza and the onion rings.	2	Sports Deli	3
Great Japanese curry spot! My husband and I recently took a trip to Okinawa, Japan for vacation  to visit friends and they introduced us to the well known awesome restaurant "coco's curry" and this place is just like that! Owner hide is so nice, but we did experience some of the best service and genuinely kind people in Japan so we weren't surprised by his excellent service. We got the combo pork katsu and chicken cutlet katsu which was great, curry was perfect flavor and consistency. I also ordered the side salad which had sesame dressing just like the kind we've had at coco's curry in Japan. Prices are very reasonable especially with the good size portions u get. The owner also offered us free dessert since it was our first time and they also offer military discount, just make sure to ask before they place your order. This place is kind of a drive for us from North Las Vegas but definitely worth it for our Japanese curry cravings. We'll definitely be frequent customers :)	5	Oh Curry	4.5
Only been in one time and was really impressed. Great customer service, and a very clean environment. Angus burger was cooked to perfection and super juicy! My friend had the char dog and said it was amazing!  Will be back!!	5	The Wiener's Circle Las Vegas	3.5
Horrible service!!! Bartenders were incredibly rude! One of the mangers came over to talk to us about the service and ended up talking to his employee in front of us. We finished our drinks and the bartender refused to take our bill because he said"we are young and wouldn't tip". We tipped the buser because he was the only one who did a great job! We waited around for another manager to discuss the issues! Do not come here! They do not care about service to their customers!	1	Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill Las Vegas	4
Canes customer service is outstanding! All their employees are super friendly and outgoing! Even though they are always busy they keep their customer service #1 and food is always fresh! I live in CA and I def always try to stop by when I can because its delish!!! Their raising canes sauce is so good! I always order extra!!! Stopping at Canes is a must!!!	5	Raising Cane's	3.5
Great drinks!  We had Elderflower martinis - they were yummy!  The food was great too.  As always Vegas was a little pricey.	3	Postrio	3.5
"This steakhouse is absolutely wonderful! I honestly don't think there is anything bad on the menu. 

I had the beef short ribs, that melted in your mouth to perfection. I wish I could make those at home myself! The party I was with ordered steak options. I tried each and they were all amazing.

Great place, clean restaurant, staff was lovely to our entire party (including a child) and the ambience made the whole experience that much better. 

I would come back but not for awhile! Expect to spend some $$"	4	Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak	4
"I am giving this restaurant a 3\/5 stars because the service was not the greatest & the portions were much smaller than what I saw in the pictures.

The server had almost too much to do at other tables and didn't really provide 4-5 star performance.

The cleanliness and ambiance were nice. I would give a 3.5 but not possible. Food was good, just not enough!

Also, be aware of the Yelp check in \/ free beer or wine. It's buy one get one & the restaurant charges full price if you don't get the second glass. My mistake for not reading the fine print but it was so small I didn't notice."	3	Off The Strip at the LINQ	4
"I think this burger bar is definitely as good as it gets! There is lots of room so parties do not have to wait for a long time. The burgers, fries and shakes are truly the best Vegas has to offer.

I will keep this review short and sweet, if you are in town and want a great burger, fries and drink - this is the best place you are going to find!

Service was great, clean restaurant and great ambiance!"	5	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4
"I wanted to find a nice \/ affordable breakfast spot close to my hotel this year in Vegas.

The diner did not disappoint. Service was great, restaurant was spotless and the food was incredible. I would call this hidden gem in Vegas!!

Will be coming back on my next visit for sure."	5	The Diner at LVM Resort	4.5
"I really don't think this restaurant deserves more than 2 or 3 stars. This past weekend I went to Mon Ami with friends and their son. I have to say, going to a restaurant such as Mon Ami really shows the cracks in the foodservice industry.

1 - They were not happy the parents requested a table outside and tried to push them to the back but the mom insisted on sitting at a table where there was light. This meant we had to wait which was fine but the attitudes were not needed from the hostesses.
2 - The mom had a stroller with her and as she was trying to park it somewhere, some servers and bartenders were rolling their eyes and laughing at our party. Again, this sort of behavior is not needed and I will not be coming back.
3 - I already talked about the hostess ""helping us"" and I thought our server was good at first but after the food came and we all ate, we were waiting for about 20-30 minutes just to ask for the check and another 10 for them to take the card for payment.

This restaurant is good for adults - don't bring your kids as the attitude from staff will make you want to leave.

Beware - Even if your party is parking - they will only seat you if the entire party is there. 
** Breakfast stops at 11 and there are 2 actual options on the brunch menu which is served all day.

All in all - I think most families \/ big parties that want brunch should go elsewhere in Vegas."	2	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"I went here over the past weekend looking to try something a bit different.

The rigatoni and bolognese dish was very good and the sauce was delicious, much better than the stuff I make at home.

Unfortunately the chicken parmigiana meal was not as good. The chicken was a bit rubbery and the meal itself was not very large in comparison to the other meal we ordered.

I may or may not go back"	3	Trevi	3.5
Holy crap is this food amazing  the staff is so friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is cute too. Next time I'm in Vegas I will def be back	5	SkinnyFATS	4.5
We were hungry, not sure what we wanted with 2 kids in a casino.  We ended up at Le Burger.  Food was great, over priced, but this is Vegas and everything is over priced on the strip, so their prices were no more so than everywhere else.  We have a very good waiter and were attended to regularly.  The burger was excellent!  Could not have been better.  The chicken Caesar salads were excellent too!	4	Burger Brasserie	3.5
"When I want to go out and eat the first thing that comes to my mind is food safety. There is no other name that you can trust like Wolfgang Puck. So during my stay at the MGM Grand we just had to try his restaurant on the casino floor. 
The food was so delicious like always, everything tasted so fresh like it was just coming from the farm directly to our table. My wife loves the chicken wings appetizer and there is no other like the one we enjoyed here. I ordered the spicy tuna tartare and it paired amazingly with a glass of off-dry German Riesling. For main course we had the Jidori Chicken (the best chicken ever, in Japan they eat it sashimi style because it is so natural and organic and safe) and the Porcini crusted Scottish Salmon served with peas and smokey pork belly was also  phenomenal!
My wife had a refreshing pomegranate margarita and she loved it. For dessert we enjoyed a really good creme brûlée, nice crust and very good texture with a nice balance of sweetness. 
They make very good cappuccinos here too. 
Our server Kyra was very attentive and friendly without being too disruptive of our meal. She made us feel right at home. 
We will certainly be back!"	5	Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill Las Vegas	4
"Long wait for the table. Very slow service. We waited approximately 10 minutes to be greeted. I expected more from a restaurant that is open for 30 years. They featured a 4 course meal for $30.30 in celebration of their 30th anniversary but the menu was a big disappointment. Appetizers were good. The mini baguette was very good. The intermediate course, a house salad was the most rustic and an item that should not be in a fine dining restaurant, mixed greens tossed in an over acidic balsamic vinaigrette. The Lasagna was mediocre, you can even see the comparison with other pictures on Yelp, they hold the garnish to save some pennies. The dessert was nothing special, a small piece of tiramisu and a hard to eat cannoli. 
The wine list is super over priced. I was looking for a good value Barbera or Langhe Nebbiolo for about $50 dollars but it was a mission impossible. They have the most expensive Italian wine list I've ever seen. If you can afford Gaja and Masseto this might be your place.
I am sure there are a lot of great Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas Strip to try. 
The owner is famous for his hospitality, however we sat in the waiting area for 50 minutes waiting for our table with our baby and he never came by even to say hi. 
I guess he only shows his hospitality to the rich regular guest who patronize his establishment."	2	Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar	4
"We had a wonderful dinner here the other night. 
The service is very efficient and friendly and the food is amazing. 
We ordered some appetizers and they were delicious, but the star of the evening was the fish, I ordered the Idaho Trout and my wife the Sea Bass, they were phenomenal, very well prepared and so delicious that I could have ordered another one for myself. The sauce was super tasty and added more flavor to the fish. 
And we also loved the sides, broccolini, caramelized corn and the Fava beans was really good. 
My wife loves the cheesecake here. 
We can't wait to go back. 
This is the best restaurant off the strip in Las Vegas. 
And we really like that it is a celebrity chef restaurant that we can afford to go to. 
Wonderful experience!"	5	Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill Summerlin	3.5
By far my favorite restaurant ever!! I have known Juan for a very long time and he always takes care of my family and I! All the staff is very friendly and professional. Anything you eat is amazing and taste very good! I always recommend Juan's to everyone!!	5	Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina	4.5
Great food. Attention to design and detail was incredible on the entire meal and serving wares. Not disappointed at all.	5	Guy Fieri's El Burro Borracho	3.5
Over 2 hours for 1 piece of cheese cake, 1 piece of chocolate cake, and 1 can of orange soda.  The wait is normally long but I normally order around dinner time but for stuff they don't even have to cook that is just plain lazy.  That and the guy at the restaurant with an I don't care about it attitude makes this the last time I will ever order from here.  Don't ever order from here.	1	Cafe Verdi	2
We have come twice for happy hour. Great sushi and prices every time! We will be back.. probably every week for date night	5	Sushi-ko	3.5
"China A Go Go is one of those to-go Chinese spots. Of course, you can eat there as well. When I'm in the mood for take out and want to catch up with Netflix, this is my jam.

I have been to the other location on Lake Mead near Boulder Hwy and it was more of a sit down with a sushi bar. I just happened to stumble upon this location when I went grocery shopping at Smith's, which is in the same shopping center. I saw on the Yelp app that you can order your food ahead of time (I like that!) but since I was so close anyways I just decided to order in person. 

-Sesame beef: LOVE! It's been a while since I've had this dish where it was fried and crunchy. So far this is the only place in LV that does it the way I like it. No soggy beef, please.

-General Tso's chicken: Always happy with General Tso, it's my safe dish at any Chinese restaurant. 

-Chow Fun: Flat noodles are my favorite! Ask them to make it spicy!

The portions were typical of any take out Chinese place. Overall, I will be back again."	4	China A Go Go	3.5
"while cruising the strip-- jason and i decided to stop by for a drink. 

lo and behold, we leave with a gigantic fishbowl of alcohol in our hands :] 
it was massive for twenty bucks and the alcohol the bartender poured in was half of the fishbowl. yikes! good thing we were sharing that sucker.

all in all, pretty good experience-- service was great, didnt have to wait long even though it was pretty crowded! i will definitely come back here on a later trip!"	4	Diablo's Cantina	3
"Saw this place in the food court and had to give it a go since it was the most legit place in the food court. Well, Chicken Now was like a rip off of Raising Canes! They even have a special sauce, that looks and tastes just like Canes. I ordered the chicken finger combo. It came with fries and a piece of texas toast on the side-- just like Canes! I was not impressed, I would much rather have Raising Canes any day over Chicken Now.

A few things make Chicken Now kind of cool (but not cool enough) is the loud hip hop music that they bump in the food court, they have kool-aid on the menu and they even have chicken and waffles! -- but still. it does not compare. Sorry Chicken Now, I wouldnt want you ""now"" or ""ever again"". oooh burn, see what i did there?"	2	Chicken Now	3.5
"I know I am going to get some yelper heat for this one, but I was not all that impressed with Cugino's. I thought about it and it's probably because I don't have some emotional connection to the place. The food was good, but it wasn't like I had a cool college memory attached to my slice of pizza. Sometimes food tastes better when you eat it during a special time in your life-- I get it. But for me, it was just pizza. 

The food was good-- the quality is what really made this place stand out. Just walking through the door you can tell that this is a REAL Italian joint. The deli was stocked and they had a pretty extensive grocery section where you can buy all the Italian cookies and treats you've been looking for. 

Lasagna-- It was very homemade and the ingredients were fresh. You could tell that this was not a lasagna that came out of the freezer. My portion was a little on the wimpy side that night. Kind of looked like it was the last slice in the pan and they had to scrape the sides to fill out its lopsided shape. The lasagna came with a garden salad, again nothing fancy. 

Pep & sausage pizza-- Ordered a small aka a personal pan. It was very simple. The toppings were of good quality, but it wasn't all that impressive.

Chicken wings-- Great flavor, but not something that I would order again. The wings were small and not really a meal (even though it was a meal and it came with fries). 

Would I come back? Yes. It was good enough to come back, but not a place that I could get excited about. I love to support local, small businesses so this place will always have my money over Pizza hut. 

Plus, I am very curious about those rice balls and the cannolis."	3	Cugino's Italian Deli & Pizza	4.5
"BEST. TACOS. IN. VEGAS.

Yes, THEE best! Just when I was convinced that the taco game sucked in Vegas, I found Tacos El Gordo and all my taco dreams came true.

Some people might not know how the ordering here works, so here are some tips. First, you order and wait to pick up your food, then you pay at the cashier. Depending on the type of meat you want, you have to stand in that specific line. Once you have your food, you go to the cashier where you pay. The soda machine is on the opposite side of the cashier. Tables could be hard to find, so when you see an open table you better go grab it. This place is popular all times of the day, so don't wait for the crowds to die down or you will never get to eat. If you have multiple people in your group, have one person can stand in each line and then one person save a table. Now that's teamwork!

-Al pastor is the fav here. It's not my usual taco order, but when I am here I get the Al Pastor. Make sure you get it with everything on it. Ask for pineapple, mmm! I ordered 2 tacos on corn tortillas. Also I am not usually a corn tortilla kind of gal, but from here.. Yes! 

-Carne asada was amazing as anticipated. I ordered tacos and the fries-- best decision I've made all week. Ask for peppers on the side. The carne asada fries reminded me of all my favorite spots back in SoCal. This place hits the spot.

Protip-- ORANGE BANG. Unlimited refills of delicious orange bang. Reminds me of my childhood in LA! They also have horchata and tamarind. I can drink a kiddie pool full of orange bang. No shame in my orange bang game."	5	Tacos El Gordo	4.5
"Came in to Vegas early in the morning and found this restaurant. 
It appears pretty popular and if you are a pancake lover you will love this place. My daughters ordered the cinnamon pancakes and the Oreo pancakes. Both portions were so large and rich that neither girl could get more than halfway through it. 
My eggs and biscuits and gravy were very good and rich."	4	Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant 	3.5
"just imagine, youve just turned 21-- traveled all the way from california to las vegas & this was your first bar that you have ever stepped foot in. you look around at all of the russian art in the room, surrounded by a red communist glow as you sip your first legal drink--  that was my experience and i was sitting happy with my cantaloupe martini :] the drink was not the greatest, but it was pretty stiff for the small asian girl that i am. my second drink was a chernobyl. this drink was amazing! ill recommend it to anyone who likes to drink alcohol, but hates the taste. this drink goes down smooth, baby ;]

and even though i was there for a good hour or so to start off my night-- i did not get a chance to try any of the food there. but its okay because i know that ill be back-- ive promised myself that i would one day be as cool as the people that i saw wearing their loaned fur coats as they stood inside the giant freezer, sipping on some vodka :]"	4	Red Square Restaurant & Vodka Lounge	4
"Z is for zebra. 

No, really. This is a zebra themed boba cafe! Super cute decor-- I love everything from the fake grass on the ground to the giant zebra painted on the wall. This place is very instagram worthy. 

Now on to the important stuff... the drinks!

I had the red bean milk tea. I never had a red bean drink before, so I have nothing to compare it to but I thought it was tasty. It was just the right amount of sweetness. There was a good amount of red bean at the bottom of the cup, too. Delish! The boba was sweet and chewy. I would definitely order this drink again. In my opinion, I thought that the prices were a little high but then again this place made better drinks than some of the other popular boba places in the area. There are two drink sizes. We ordered one large and one regular and it came out to about $10ish after you add boba. Not including tip for the tip jar.

We came here around 8pm on a weekend night and this place was empty. The employees were helpful and brought out our drinks to our table, instead of just calling our names to pick it up. It is also very clean inside. Definitely a place you can hang out for a bit and enjoy your tea. I will be back!"	4	Mr. Z Tea Co	4.5
"Fake trees? Check.
Indoor fire pit? Check.
Mirror ceiling? Check.
Neon lights? Check.
Gigantic servings? Check.

This place is fun! Open 24 hours a day like any cool Vegas landmark should, so you can stop by whenever you feel like eating traditional diner fare. I am a sucker for breakfast foods, so I always seem to go for the fruity french toast. However the last time I shared a philly cheesesteak (which was great by the way!) and the nachos. OMG those nachos are insane! They arrived at our table on huge plate, piled high! We ordered it with the ground beef. The cheese& bean dip, salsa, and sour cream arrive on the side. That thing you can share with 5+ people! Between the two of us, we didn't even make a dent. Our server boxed it all up for us and it still took two to-go containers! There is also a photographer that comes by to all the tables and offers you a complimentary picture. We passed on the picture, but next time I might have to prom pose with my gigantic stack of pancakes! *swoon* 

Even as a local, I enjoy the crazy decor and the food. I've been to the Peppermill twice now and both visits were consistently awesome! I look forward to my next meal dining under those fake trees."	4	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
Mediocre ramen with terrible service. They harass you for the first 5 minutes of sitting down then pretend you don't exist for the next 40. If you need anything from the waitstaff during your meal you're out of luck. Took 30 minutes just to get the check to leave. Okay ramen and nice to have something on this side of town but won't be coming back due to terrible service.	1	Ichi Ramen House	4
"Stopped in with a group of 14 and enjoyed friendly, prompt service even with four separate checks. The food was great! 
I had the corned beef hash and eggs and both were great. Hubby had biscuit and gravy and loved it. 
Friend's chorizo omelette got a thumbs up as well. 
The decor is old school Vegas, lots of tables in the back as well as booths. 
Will definitely stop here again!"	4	Omelet House	4.5
"I have been so sick of Vegas buffets and their same old, same old bland, over cooked foods that it was such a pleasure to find a buffet that had good food worth the price.  I have tried the weekend breakfast buffet twice in the past two months and both times found the omelettes to be perfectly made, the breads fresh and delicious, and all the other dishes I tried were 1)original and 2)tasty!

There were many food options, all at different stations or ""regions"" of cooking so I think all preferences can be satisfied here.  I don't know that I would spend the money to take my kids again because it was a little pricier than other buffets, but a definite return for the hubby and me!"	4	Le Village Buffet	3
LOVED it! Came here for lunch on a Saturday in October.  There were four of us, all hungry and grumpy.  We all ordered the $20 all-meat lunch and we loved it! The meats were all delicious and interesting, and even better, all the side dishes were well made, creative, original and tasty!  Will definitely do it again, especially for lunch!	4	Pampas Churrascaria Brazilian Grille	3
"I'll admit to never writing reviews on Yelp. It's been just about one week since we've been back from Las Vegas, and I'm still bothered by our experience at MGM. Thankfully we only had one night there. Admittidly we booked the room to be able to use the lazy river. I wish I had known we'd be paying $30 for one drink at the bar outside. 

First, check-in was extremely long. Their mobile check in was 'down' so everyone had to wait in line. It was only 12pm, but the line wrapped back and forth a few times. When we got to the desk, there was a hard sell on an upgrade. We ended up doing it when we were told it was 'a nicer tower with a much better view, especially of the pool'. That was a total lie. We had a low floor view of the building. The rooms, and elevators, were all extremely dark.

We spent what was left of the day at the pool, and then the casino at night. We got to our room at about midnight, and went to bed. We were awoken at 2:30am by an extremely loud crash into our door. Being woken out of a dead sleep by what sounded like someone breaking into the room was not pleasant. My boyfriend looked out the peephole to see what was going on, only to see a hooker and a John fighting in the hallway. While I understand you can't control how guests act, it was how security acted that really upset me. I called security and we waited in our room for them to arrive while listening to the screaming and fighting. My boyfriend met the security guards in the hallway, and pointed them to the room a few doors down where the guy was. The woman came back at him, still screaming, while security looked on. They allowed them to continue to yell and stomp down the hallway and throw items. A few times my boyfriend asked the guard that was by our door if he could please remove them from our floor because I was still visibly bothered by the fighting, as I was trying to come down from the adrenaline rush from being woken up. Instead of separating the hooker and the John to sort out the issue, he told my boyfriend to be quiet as if he were the problem. When they eventually calmed down after about 15 minutes, security walked the female away, and the man went back to his room. When we left in the morning, they were taking off his bloodied hotel room door as he watched on.

We waited in the long check-out line to bring up the issue. They basically said 'sorry' and took off the resort fee. $35 compensation for a horrendous nights sleep. They took no responsibility for being unable or unwilling to take control of a bad situation and make their guests feel safe. We were also assured that he was removed from the property, which was a lie, seeing as we saw him twice that next morning. Once outside his room, and once in the lobby.  

I will never again stay at MGM."	1	MGM Grand Hotel	3
Among all the buffets in Las Vegas, is this one very special? not really. Why did we come here then?  only b\/c we bought the buffet of buffets, and this was one of the buffets on the card.  One great thing about this buffet was that there was no wait!  so if you are almost done with your 24 hours on the card, but you still feel like trying another buffet, this would be the one to try!  Lot of food selection, and it is clean. dessert section wasn't too great, just mostly cupcakes.	3	Spice Market Buffet	3
A really nice outlet in Vegas!  Better than the one by the state line!   Come and check it out.	4	Las Vegas North Premium Outlets	4
Although I am not a big fan of beef noodles, I still wanted to come here and try their other dish. I ordered pig feet (i know, sounds scary) noodle soup.  I was not very impressed with it.  They were only 3 medium size pig feet in the soup, so it was not very filling.  I think the beef noodle soup would've been more filling.  But this place seems to be very popular as people kept coming in.  The turn over rate is pretty fast, so even if there is a line, i wouldn't think the wait would be too long.   If you are sick of buffets on the strip and feel like some hot (both temperature and spice) beef noodle soup, come and try this place.	3	Noodle Pot	3.5
"Whose idea was this to sell this card???  It was too tempting not to get it!!! :(   We originally wanted to try Bacchanal buffet at Caesars palace, but we realized that the buffet itself cost $55 (weekend rate), while the buffet of buffets card was like $50 something as well.. (well, we needed to add $15 per person for visiting Bacchanal buffet), but we figured it was still a good deal considering we could still go to other buffets the next day...  so we bought the card...

first night: Bacchanal buffet (very good)!

second day brunch: Paris le village (a bit disappointed).

second day dinner: Spice market buffet (decent). 

If you are a huge fan of buffets, then this card is something you should get!!!  but seriously, by the third buffet, all i got was one plate and some fruits...  still not bad, i guess..."	4	Buffet of Buffets	4
My first time to Las Vegas Chnatown plaza after going to Vegas for so many years!  and after being here, I kinda understand why none of my friends mentioned this place...  It is not a TOWN, it is really a plaza..  some restaurants here and there, but I guess I probably wouldn't want to come all the way to Las Vegas from Cali. to have Chinese food!    Don't expect too much when you come here, except maybe some cheap meals...	3	Las Vegas Chinatown Plaza	3.5
Marvelous food and beverages. Incredible Manager. Amazing staff.  We ate there 2 days in a row and the food just kept getting better. The specialty tap drinks are so amazing I hope they start to bottle and sell them. If you like Japanese cuisine definitely check this place out. I'm going to write corporate a letter and ask them to expand to Denver, Co so I can eat there all of the time!	5	Yusho	3
Finally made the pilgrimage to Lotus and was it worth it!  The food is spectacular, the service was very friendly and helpful, and can we talk about the riesling selection on the wine list?  Absolutely one of the best meals\/experiences I've had in a very long time.  If you are in LV you MUST make a trip to Lotus.	5	Lotus of Siam	4
If its a nice hot tasty bowl of authentic Vietnamese pho you're craving, head straight over to Pho King! There is a vast array of meats to choose from for your soup. We also tried the Bun style rice noodle dish with bbq pork which was fantastic. To top it off, service is always fast and polite.	5	Pho King	4.5
The service was fantastic with helpful staff, great hospitality and nice attitudes.  The manager (sorry that we have missed the name of that beautiful lady) and her asistant are enthusiastic in taking care of us.  All the time helping us to replace new dishes for sharing food and deserts.  After being frustrated by the poor service in Joe's Seafood last night, we have retrieved our confidence in services in Las Vegas restaurants and once again feel very impressed with the entertainment industry and tourism of Las Vegas.	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
We are overseas tourist to Las Vegas and it was our first time visiting the restaurant.  It was really a nightmare dinner as we got the feeling of being pushed to finish ordering food and leave the restaurant asap.  I can consider it as a formally dressed fast food shop.  Actually no service at all and the waiters just want you to order as much as possible for receiving big tips and kick you out asap for another guest.	1	Joes Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab	4.5

1. Slow service 2. Wrong orders 3. Lagged long enough to where half the people finished their food and left before the other half got theirs . 4. Bad experience in general 5. And no service with a smile.	1	Johnny Rockets	3
My favorite spot!! Food is always good and the service is on point!! I'd come here everyday if I could!	5	Gorilla Sushi	4.5
I went here for a quick bite while figuring what to do on the town.  The service was rather nice and professional. Water was refilled frequently and they were pretty nice. Had a beef rice bowl...probably not a signature dish but I was in the mood. The rice was some nice long-grain rice that was cooked fantastically, the beef was pretty high-quality...so it was like a very upscale "beef bowl".  HOWEVER it was like $18.  So minus a ding for the price for what you get.  Also another ding for an unknown reason...while the beef bowl was upscale-ish, it still didn't satisfy my palate for some reason...the vegetables somehow torpedoed the meal for me and I kind of left unfulfilled.	3	Wazuzu	3.5
"I've heard about Grimaldi's in NY, so was surprised that they had locations in LV. Meatball Pizza with Ricotta and garlic...really awesome. Great crust, I loved it. I did take it to go but we devoured the pizza before hitting the town. The guy behind the bar was really cool too, talking about the pizza and filters and the other location, etc. 

Definitely get more next time I'm in town."	4	Grimaldi's Pizzeria	4
Pretty average, overpriced chophouse\/grill. the bone in ribeye was kind of weak but the cream spinich was awesome.  really expensive for a poor grade of ribeye though.	2	Red, White & Blue Restaurant	2.5
"I've been here about 4 times....while I was expecting the world, it really is a pretty solid establishment..but not great.  Its solid....but really not that much of a knockout as one would expect with Kellar's repuatation.  

This is a combo review of several visits....

the Moules Marinade was quite good...and filling...however, it was crap compared to any bistro you would find in Paris or Belgium.  I wish they were a bit more agressive with the flaovring of the broth itself....

Chicken and Waffles....while the waffles were great (esp. the butter), I really like Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles much better...it just seemed a bit too refined and was quite average.  

Salmon Rilletes:  this was damn awesome.  This alone brought the review from 3 to 4 stars. 

Croque Madam- Too rich for my tastes

Berries: great

service: has always been great."	4	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
Went back to see if they got their act together...not. Gumbo was shockingly average coming from a chef that embraces his New Orleans background. Service was slow....really slow.  Truffled mac and cheese was decent. But the food is very average, when I go out I want to eat better than what I can prepare quickly at home. Especially if I am to wait (most of the wait was after the meal to get the check, maybe 15-20 minutes..inexcusable at a non-busy restaurant at lunch time)	1	Table 10	3.5
"I know it looks bad when I constantly give 5 star reviews, but I had a good weekend in vegas so screw it. 

Service was dope. Super nice and helpful. We ordered a lot, I could barely move after the meal and that was with leftovers. 

Head about the chile rubbed ribeye for 2...more like for 3. it was HUGE.  Spicy and oh so good. I've had several of my steaks at high end places kicked back to the kitchen because of poor cooking\/firing but here the steak was perfect. They gave you SHUN steak knives...it was so good that steak. Tender, juicy and the chile rub was just the perfect spiciness. Loved it. 

Sides were good too. Au Gratin, Creamed Spinach and holy crap, the creamed corn with black truffle. So good in fact, my brother started asking how much were black truffles so he could make this at home. 

Starters were good too. Big Eye Tuna Cerviche...awesome. Foie Gras Terrine....awesome.  Only miss of the night was the wedge salad. They used a mini-lettuce head..I prefer the traditional wedge. The pork belly was also a bit too thick..I like the bacon crispy and crunch like bacon bits, not like having a slab of pork bacon over the wedge. 

But awesome spot. They opened up the window to the waterfall but didn't stay for the show...maybe next time."	5	SW Steakhouse	4
"Excellent buffett, probably the best ""standard hotel"" buffet I've had in Vegas.  Loved the cerviches, crab legs, and salads in particular. The prime rib was quite good and it wasn't so ""gorge yourself until you explode"" vibe you get at cheaper buffetts around town.  

Minus points for a relatively weak dessert selection and a very weak selection of fresh fruits. There were plastic mangos everywhere, yet no mangos to be found on the buffett."	4	The Buffet	3.5
"One of my staples for my old school Vegas days. I used to come here a LOT, because I could charge everything on the room and it wouldn't be TOO expensive. Had breakfast the other day...quite a good version of the standard staple of Steak and Eggs.  Minus a star for it being $20 though....this is Vegas, its only supposed to be $9.99.  

I did love that the waitress brought some Heinz 57 though."	3	Studio Café	2.5
Its an ok, clean hotel...but the location kind of sucks and not quite up to some of the standards I've expereinced at other Westins. I mean, who goes to vegas to stay at the westin?  Unless you've stayed at every other hotel in town before (I have), I wouldn't recommend staying here on vacation.  For saving money, its fine....but I'd still prefer a strip hotel.	2	Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa	3
Went back to Stratta after a late night at XS for some late night drunken eats. Service was much improved from my last visit, the waiter was very helpful. Steak and eggs were excellent. And the meatball sandwich was GREAT as well with the marinara sauce.  Would return based on this visit.	4	Stratta	3.5
"I've never done high tea, and this was a great experiences. Make a reservation for a window seat and make decisions on life that will make and break your next several years. Its a very reflective time and the hustle and bustle of vegas below is very soothing in a strange way.  Very relaxing and opens your eyes to a unique perspective.  

Had the Mandarin Oriental blend, which was very good.  I had eaten a burger for lunch about 2 hours earlier so I opted for the dessert bento. Very large selection and great chocolate decadence, finished maybe 1\/3 of that but it was really good. 

Service was spot on as well."	5	Tea Lounge	4
"the vibe and the crowd make this the best pool party in vegas. Rehab is trashy now. I like Wet Republic too, but the people are much better looking at Encore Beach overall, its got a more international vibe to it. I also appreciate they crack down on water splashing at these parties as it gets annoying having to cover your drinks half the time. 

I took a star off because they wouldn't let non-Wynn hotel guests exit and go back through the hotel, instead making us walk on the 110 degree strip after an afternoon of heat and beverages."	4	Encore Beach Club	4
"Did the tasting discovery menu, was outstanding. standouts were the onion tart (maybe I should have done the white truffle supplement but it was awesome as is) and the oysters poached in echiere butter.  The orange dessert they had was out of this world. 

Very consistent, great service. Changed silverware after every course, very quickly.  

next time I may order off the menu though."	5	L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon	4.5
"went back to the club and the restaurant as well. The VIP host ""Robert C"" was very good, he hooked us up with a great dancefloor table next to some very pretty girls. That was a good night. I love this club, its all about having a good time unlike other clubs where its all about trying to show off how much money you can burn through in a night. Music is always great, favorite is the DJ Vice Sundays but the La Freak Friday party was fun as well. 

Also had dinner here. The Kobe meatball was amazing. Huge, ate it later, would want to try it with ricotta...also loved the eggplant, fresh mozerella and rigatoni....al dente...the complimentary garlic bread and tomato sauce was awesome. the only complaint was on the tuna tartare the olive on the side made it a little salty, but then again I'm not really big on tuna tartare to begin with. Service was really great, our waitress really was helpful."	5	LAVO Italian Restaurant & Lounge	3.5
"Honestly I was scared based on reading these reviews and others that mentioned ""Hakkastairs"".  It wasn't as bad as I thought. 

Went last weekend for bob sinclar using presale tix from wanttickets.....waited a whole 2 minutes to get in...only way to go if you're not doing bottles. 

Was absolutely blown away. the opening DJ was dope as hell...had a great mix and felt the crowd to get warmed up. layout was surprisingly dope, the dance floor I was able to get around a bit....sound system was tremendous and they had FREAKIN CRYO BLASTS COMING DOWN FROM THE CEILING ON TO YOU. That was just insane...video screen above the DJ and they had a second level with choreographed dancers to the performance.  Just freakin incredible, I was really really impressed with the venue and Bob Sinclar was dope as hell.   

Checked out the venue a bit, I'd personally stay away from the hip hop room...out of the way and just got a weird vibe. The main stage was where its at...go dancefloor tables, don't think the back room or upstairs would be as good."	5	Hakkasan Nightclub	2.5
Mesa Grill is good, solid food.  The prices are pretty outrageous at dinner, but brunch\/lunch are very reasonable. The mesa burger is great. Also had the Pork Tenderloin which was really solid (should have been at $45+).  Margaritas are EXCELLENT and its a good place to get a primer into Tequila options.  I love the bread basket they bring....really really good.	4	Mesa Grill	4
This is a fairly solid steakhouse with Prime cuts of meat that are cooked to order.  I had the Ribeye, medium rare and it was quite good, seasoned and cooked appropriately. I would put the steak overall as "average" in the realm of great steaks in my life.  The sides were quite good. The Lobster mashed potatoes weren't that good...the consistency of the potatoes were a bit more processed than I preferred...the creamed spinich and the sauteed mushrooms are quite good. Service was non-intrusive and fairly fast, the decor and layout kind of sucked for a steakhouse....I am glad I went here and when I'm at the HRH, I'll probably eat here again so I don't have to suffer through Pink Taco or Mr. Lucky's ever again.	3	AJ's Steakhouse	3.5
I've heard about how this is the "best thai restaurant in America".  Its a very good one, but I really didn't notice the big difference between it and Renu Nakorn which was at a time related to Lotus of Siam. Service was very good though...its a very solid thai restaurant, but it didn't knock my socks off like others have said..I believe this review would suffer from unrealistically high expectations.	3	Lotus of Siam	4
"This place is terrible. The only plus is that it's in the hard rock hotel. I've thrown up their food several times (probably more alcohol than food). The only thing I've had here that's passable is the steak and eggs breakfast.  It sucks because at late night, at those hours its hard to get food unless you want to eat crappy chips from the little sundries shop.  There's a pizza place across the street open real late...but then again you have to walk across the street. 

Knowing me I'll eat here at least 5-10 times a year because I always stay at the Hard Rock."	1	Mr. Lucky's 24-7	3.5
Yes, I know it's only breakfast, but this place is amazing! Everything tastes super fresh and tasty! Expect to wait about 25-30 mins., but i promise you it is all worth it. Not to mention the staff is super attentive and nice. Am loving this place!	5	Mr. Mamas	4.5
"I think what this buffet suffers from is the classic example of style over substance. Presentation wise, the food looked very good. The descriptions of the food were quite good as well. Very ""foodie"" in nature. However, where it suffered was breadth of selection and quality\/execution of food, both were VERY poor.  If you can't even do a decent biscuits and gravy at a las vegas buffet, its time to give up. 

There are actually TWO lines here, one where you wait to pay and a second one where you wait for a table. I don't know how much more inefficient it could have been.  Service was piss poor as well. We didn't get our drink orders in until AFTER our first plates of food were finished (and we had someone wait at the table to make sure to get it). The table next to us, jealous of our bottle of water asked us ""do we have to get our own water here?""

Foodwise, like I stated earlier, its all foodie sounding concepts that are presented in a hip fashion. Tastewise, it was very crappy and cooked on a mass-produced scale with seemingly no consideration to taste. I enjoyed maybe two selections, the french toast and the sliced lamb.  

Pho bar was embarrassingly bad. I'd be shocked if the stock WASN'T powdered beef stock. Smoked salmon tasted off. Chicken wings were disgusting and strange texture, Chocolate covered strawberries had a weird powder dusting which ruined the flavor. didn't even want to touch the sandwiches, pizzas or chinese food with a 10 foot pole because they just looked either dry or under the heat lamps too long.  Overly salty pastas. The list can go on and on. Also, some of the foods are hard to reach due to the low positioning of the glass shields. 

I've probably been to 80% of the Vegas buffets and this one rates very low on the scale. If you're going to go to one, do one that actually cooks their food well (like the Wynn or Bellagio)."	1	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"I returned and it got that 5th star. One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas and I love eating and sharing. The desserts did it, man. the best flan I've ever had, some olive oil ice cream and a chocolate dessert that kind of shut my talkative ass up for a minute. 

Had the Paellea, it was good but not as good as I had in Spain. I actually enjoyed the fideo-type dish (paella with noodles instead of rice). the aioli makes it really good though."	5	Jaleo	3.5
"Its pretty cheap italian food. $20 bucks for a 3 course meal which is good.  quality..not so much.  There was a romaine heart in my cesar salad which is a no-no...also, got more of the inner, light green part of the romaine.  the cesar dressing was a bit overpowering.  The lasagne was average..nothing outstanding at all.  

HOWEVER, the service was very good.  Waiter was funny and the staff was all friendly and accomodating."	3	Al Dente	3
"I had a green chile burger here and the cheddar fries. Also started off with a gazpacho.  

The green chile burger was average, as an purveryor of fine burgers, it was probably somewhere in the middle...not sure, the combo of everything just seemed a bit off.  I think the meat blend for the burgers, it didn't taste as premium as others...a nice char on the burger would have been good.

Gazpacho was great though and the cheese fries were rather amazing.  I've got to say, great service inside Cafe Babareeba (which I want to check out)."	3	Stripburger	4
"Went on Friday night. Nice vibe...strangely its a mix of brazillian steakhouse and japanese...the brazillian is much stronger, the sushi was rather pedestrian...the tempura options was pretty good though.  

Also got an assortment of Brazillian meats...pricier than it should be...

Drinks were good, although the sake sommilier was a bit pretencious (the concept not the actual person)....especially for what essentially is a low end restaurant with overpriced options. 

the restaurant didn't really have an identity...ok...brazillian-japanese...yeah.  it was a bit odd....the ambiance was pretty damn awesome though...just too forward of concepts that don't go together really....drinks were fine."	3	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
"So Yum!  Hadn't been here for awhile and finally went for my belated Birthday Dinner this past Friday Jan 27th.  We got there a litter after 7 p.m. and even though they looked to be quite busy, we were seated right away.  My husband and I had the octopus salad, which was really delicious and tender, not the least bit chewy.  I had the Branzino, so good and had the perfect amount of crisp to the skin.  Husband had the Chicken Milanese which he quite enjoyed.  Now we usually always have the Stracciatella because it's just perfect, but we didn't on this occasion because I wanted to make sure we had plenty of room for dessert.  We had the Panino Dulce, a Brioche Bread with Nutella and Hexx Chocolate with a side sauce that also had Hexx Chocolate.  The dessert sounds complicated, but looked simple and rustic, and was the most delicious dessert I have had in a long time.  

Will be going again not just for dinners, but also realized they have a Happy Hour.  How awesome is that?"	5	Due Forni	4
Terrible service.  Ordered a breakfast sandwich, along with a latte, tea, and muffin.  Waited over 20 minutes for the breakfast sandwich, had to remind them twice to even put in toaster oven.  Meanwhile husband finished his latte and I'm nursing this tea and muffin waiting.  They did give us our money back for the sandwich, but come on!	2	Sambalatte Torrefazione	4
Dude, they need to clean.  It was like searching for a needle in a haystack to find a clean table here.  Never saw anyone clean any of the dirty tables around me the 20 min I was here. One guy was collecting trays, but honestly it's a large space and with that many people coming in and out you need 2 people dedicated to the task of keeping it clean. Food and crumbs on the tables and on the floors.  Someone needs to tell them that what happens in the front of the house could likely be an indication of what is happening in the back of the house.  If they don't care what it looks like in the public areas where everyone can see can you tell me they honestly care what it looks like in the back (where no one can see) where they're preparing food?  Praying I don't get sick from this meal and never coming back.	1	Panera Bread	3.5
Just left after sitting there for 15 minutes completely ignored.  Place was half full so it doesn't make sense.  After reading the reviews it seems like slow service is the norm.	1	Waffle Bar	3.5
My parents kept ranting a raving about this place and I finally tried it. It's a "hole in the wall" kind of a place, but extremely good. All of their soups and main courses I've eaten have been great. What is a huge plus is that I never feel like I just ate a container of salt after leaving, it's not too seasoned like other places. Check them out!	5	Great Wall Chinese Restaurant	4
"looooooove! First off, their staff is super attentive and friendly. 
You can always come for a quick bite date night. They have a variety of things, all which are great! My fave three things are: Tum Yum Koong, Thai chicken salad, masaman chicken and spicy basil chicken! Yumm!!"	4	Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant	4
I love their lettuce wrapped burgers. The waiters are always pretty fast and attentive. Not to mention their endless salad anddddd sweet potato fries for the hubby. Everything we have ordered is always tasty.	3	Red Robin Gourmet Burgers	3.5
We went to La Comida for a bachelorette party after hearing great things about this restaurant. When we got there our server seemed a bit off, but whatever I figured the food was what we were there for anyway! After ordering and getting the smallest cup of guacamole I had ever seen, came my main course. The fajitas were horrible. If your chicken tastes like fish... Something's wrong. After sending the order back the waiter came back with an attitude...!! Over all a horrible experience. I would never go back.	1	La Comida	3.5
Amazing food and the owner is super friendly!!! Great quality food!!! By far the best Mediterranean food in town.	3	Baladie Café	4
Delicious food and friendly staff. The first time I went I was afraid of what it would be like since it's very hidden and not too busy but, nevertheless, it was amazing!!!! Everything on their menu is great. Cheese naan is a MUST!	5	Saffron Flavors of India	4
Breakfast is good, but their coffees are to die for! I mainly go because it is definitely a different scene and their breves are delicious!	4	Leoné Café	4
My husband and I decided to try this "fresh" place out! Food was very good, juices and smoothies are also great. Definitely, a good place for a quick, healthy bite.	4	Rachel's Kitchen	3.5
Never fails! Anything and everything is delicious! One of my faves, is the Gorgonzola filet mignon... Always cooked perfectly and try their Bellini!!!  And it never hurts that the staff is always friendly!	4	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
I came and ate with the family on Sunday and it was great!! I read a lot of reviews on it and breakfast is always blahhh.... But this was tasty and I would definitely go back!!! Not to mention their staff was super attentive and nice!	5	The Original Sunrise Cafe	4.5
"Wanted to come and check this place out after i read so many great reviews, so it finally happened. We went Sunday morning for breakfast annndddd we were kind of let down. First off their freshly brewed coffee was $4! Leone cafe among other places are freshly brewed for 2.50-3.00. Then the
Food that came was nothing worth $14 bucks a plate. I understand that they buy and make everything fresh, but $40 for coffee and eggs was a little over the top, especially since it was nothing out of this world. Food was just okay. Wish it would have been better, since I love going to mom and pop shops."	3	Divine Eatery	4
Sooooo good, that I had to add them on yelp and write this!!!! Hubby and I just got back from Texas and we were missing the BBQ, and by coincidence this was right by the house so we decided to come in. Holy cow! Everything was delicious. We ordered their brisket and it was soft and most, and super flavorful! All three of their sauces were over the top and their sides were great! I better start hitting the gym because I'll be here too often!!! :P	4	Dickey's Barbecue Pit	3
Their breakfast portions are pretty big! Their coffee is GREAT and their steak and eggs are my fave! First time I went out waitress was extremely nice, which always makes the visit nice and she even gave us coffee to go!	5	Rise & Shine a Steak & Egg Place	4
"I've been wanting to come here for awhile, so I had my hopes up about this place. We came about 3 on a Monday, and was it packed! There was a line for the inside so we just decided to sit at the bar, which had some opened seats. We sat down and the bartender cleaned the counter and said he would be right with us. He was the only bartender on duty, poor guy. Despite that, he did get down our orders pretty quick,but they did take awhile to get unfortunately. 

We shared a s'more hot chocolate,which was good. To eat, we got some sliders for appetizer, caesar salad with shrimp and salmon, and a side of mac n' cheese. All the food was good, except for the sliders. The sliders were extremely over-cooked and they were the size of a half dollar, yes you read that right. Super expensive considering the size and portion ($14? and only 5 fo them I think). Not worth the money at all. The salad was over $20 but it was well worth it because it was delicious. Salmon and shrimp were so yummy! Mac n' cheese was as well! Our bartender was super nice and attentive considering his circumstances, and even comped the drink off the bill. 

Still like the place,but maybe next time I'll just go for some ice cream"	3	Serendipity 3	3
"If you are vegetarian or vegan the choices are very limited and not that great .good marketing so they will draw you in but you may be disappointed .
Noodles are salty vegetable fried rice you can hardly  find the rice feels like we order a salad .
Sushi rolls are very average.... 
Good service friendly stuff"	2	TAO Asian Bistro	3.5
"Excellent good food great service .
Tomato salad excellent .
Sea bass amazing ... A lot of good choices if you vegetarian"	5	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
Worth the hype and the wait.  Extremely high quality and tasty BBQ at unbeatable prices!  Menu does stray a bit at times (eg cream cheese wantons and spicy tuna served on top fried rice balls), but the core meats (kalbi, bulgogi) and bibimbop (particularly the bulgogi bibimbop!) are all awesome.  Make sure to order a large Hite and do some Korean Soju bombs as well!	5	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5
4 for service - Leo was excellent. 3 for Food.  5 for Margaritas...  This Margarita was smooth - not sour, just excellent.  Waiter recommended excellent South American Pinot with the Pork Pebil - slow roasted heaven in a banana leaf.  Throw some of that in a corn tortilla and savor.  Ceviche was OK.  Serve my favorite thick style chips with a trio of excellent salsas and salts.  Decor was fun - modern, red, water and slide show of fruits that was, well a little bit suggestive, but hey this is Vegas right...	4	Diego Mexican Cuisine	3.5
"OK,  so I am always on the hunt for the next great breakfast spot,  so when this place hit my radar,  I wanted to check it out.  

I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon,  not really knowing what to expect. I walked in to a large open space that was moderately busy as it was after the typical breakfast rush.  I was given a brief overview of the service style,  specials and items that were sold out; it was done in a very welcoming manner.  

The counter service will take some getting used to for me,  but the menu and service more than makes up for this issue of mine.   

I came in specifically for the Guava Chiffon Pancakes,  and the crab-benny caught my eye,  so a 1\/2 order of both were in store.  Both were delicious, even though I believe the Eggs Benedict is what will keep me coming back,  also why you should stop in yourself. 

The pricing is on par for the portion size and overall a good value.  Service was solid and friendly and it was great to see the hands on pride of whom I believe to be the owner touching tables and leading by example.  

All in all a solid little spot.  It gets 5 stars from me because for an operation that is less than two months old,  it is clear to me that they are doing something right.  I will be back."	5	Cinnamon's	4
Going to Gordon Ramsay Steak restaurant was the highlight of my trip. My husband and I are huge Gordon fans have been looking forward to this experience for a long time and it exceeded our expectations. We came in a group of 8 people for my 30th Birthday and everyone was so impressed. Service was fantastic. Everyone went above and beyond to explain the menu and their recommendations. My husband got a filet and scallops and he LOVED IT. Being my first time to a Gordon restaurant, I didn't even think twice about what I wanted, I had to get the beef Wellington. It better than I could have expected. Drinks were also delish along with the appetizers. I am happy to say Gordon does live up to high expectation. I can't wait to visit Vegas again so I can come back to eat here.. maybe even run into Gordon so he can meet his number 1 fan .	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
"Tom oh, Tom... How do we ""Colicchio"" our other meals???  Would you come to our house?  My stomach would pay dearly for your services.  The staff was terrific, the food was excellent across the board.  Using such high quality of meat brings an air of unusually soft and flavorful mouthfeel to your palate.  I'm coming back... I think my stomach has already made a reservation!
Steve"	5	Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak	4
"There has been a noticeable change at this location.

Their sandwiches are much skimpier than other Capriotti's shops and from when they first opened. It doesn't feel like I am eating a signature sandwich. My last 3 orders were made wrong, even though I was specific about my condiments and garnishes. The current roster of employees don't seem particularly happy either...

I won't be back at this location for a while."	2	Capriotti's Sandwich Shop	3.5
"If it were only a review of Dan, the server who waited on me, and the other staff who helped me, the place would get 4.5 stars, or even a perfect 5. The food is what brought my experience down. 

The place is clean, things were pleasant. Food presentation was fast and nice. The caprese was served with just underripe beefsteak tomato. The balsamic was ordinary, at best. 

The biggest disappointment was the pizza. It's rated one of the best in Vegas, and I'd like to meet the people who voted on this and ask them what in the world they were thinking. It's far, FAR from some of the best I've had in life. 

Don't get me wrong, the pie was ok. Barely. The old adage rings true: if it's good, it's great... But I'd say the pie was just south of mediocre. The crust was the best part and it needed another dollop of sauce. The biggest travesty is they charge a fixed price for toppings regardless of the size of the pie. So, I got a personal pie (12"") and paid the same price for my ham and mushrooms that a large pie (18"") pays. Sorry, but that's just not right. 

To Dan's credit, he just listened to my bitching and didn't take one side or other. Next time I'm in Vegas and looking for a pizza on the way out of town I'm headed to Metro Pizza like I should've done tonight."	3	Grimaldi's Pizzeria	4
"I stopped in last Monday evening after deciding to find something aside of the Strip places and hotel restaurants. To be fair, they're fine, but I wanted something a little different and more personal for the chef creating the food. 

So to Carson Kitchen I went, and I wasn't disappointed. Parallel parking out front and immediately seated at about 6p at the bar. Because it was only me, I ordered gyro tacos and seared scallops with mango habanero salsa. These two were powerful and delicate, respectfully. Fresh taco shells\/pita and amazing flavor combinations in the tacos. Careful selections of flavors with the scallops as to compliment and not overpower. (Pair the scallops with a Kronenbourg Blonde-they're a perfect marriage.) For dessert I had the glazed doughnut bread pudding. I couldn't fit anything else. 

Best was that everything is made from fresh and service was fast and courteous, to say the least. I had plate envy from those around me that I couldn't indulge for lack of stomach space. 

I'll definitely be back next time in Vegas."	5	Carson Kitchen	4.5
"Classic and reliable breakfast food provided by friendly and responsive staff. The pot of bread is a fun diversion from the usual-usual. The Country Skillet was delicious and well balanced. There was a good amount of meat\/egg\/potato mixed together (some skillets at other places are 70% potato and few ingredients). The scrambled eggs were fresh and fluffy. Their omelets are also hefty. The Sandy Omelet packs in a lot of flavor and should satisfy your hunger.

All in all, an easy and pleasant experience."	4	Jamms Restaurant	4.5
Food and service are very good. It's a happy change to have a neighborhood restaurant that actually knows how to make a good omelette. Ingredients are fresh, portions are generous. The menu is very comprehensive. The downside that will limit future visits is price. $45.00 for breakfast for 2 is a bit steep. This is not The Strip, it's a strip mall in the SW. Yes, portions are big and we had leftovers, but their price points add some apprehension.	3	Squeeze In	4.5
A total disappointment. My expectations were set by the many, many raving reviews, but it was a waste of money. Ordered The Montagu and the ingredients were VERY skimpy. The sandwich was primarily bread with vague and scant flavors; nothing like anyone's descriptions. This sandwich could have come out of a vending machine. Salad portions are a rip-off. Not worth the money or effort. Lame.	1	Earl of Sandwich	4
"Good variety of dishes. Go for dinner to discover the real creative and tasty items. Lunch is a great deal, but is a limited and standard menu.

Highlights:
Deep-fried tofu is fresh, silky smooth and soaks in a strong and savory sauce
Hamachi Jalapeno and Maguro Carupaccio provide a nice kick of spice
Tsukune with and without sauce
Shitaake
Pork Kimchee

We also got a few pieces of nigiri hamachi and it was like buttuh. It's nice to have a sushi-ish restaurant in the SW that serves quality fish and a has skilled kitchen. Service was not too stellar, as our waiter disappeared for a long time. Will likely sit at the sushi bar next time."	4	Kyara Japanese Tapas	4
"Was finally able to try Fukuburger at the Foodie Fest after a few missed opportunities and attempts around town. I was sooo looking forward to the savory experience that everyone is bragging about here, but I walked away feeling empty and confused.

My burger order looked like something that came out of a low-budget public school cafeteria. It was slapped together quickly and didn't appear like anything I've seen posted on Yelp. It felt diminutive in comparison. It was a mess to eat, as the bun was already soggy in the 50 feet I walked to sit down. I could taste some good flavors in the burger\/sauces, but they were blurred as I fought to keep all the parts together. I ordered jazz fries, but received regular fries because of an apparent typo. The fries were also cooked unevenly. Not anywhere worth $9.00.

Saddened sigh. I tried to determine what factors might have contributed to my experience, but really couldn't rationalize anything. There was NO ONE in line when I ordered, so there was no frenzy surrounding it. After I finished my food, I sat there with a sunken heart and blank stare."	2	Fukuburger Truck	4
"This is not the same store when it first opened and during its first 2 years.

It's great that Glazier's is a mom-and-pop operation and that Mr. and Mrs. G. are hands-on and accessible. I appreciate their efforts to bring in many regional products and brands from the East Coast and Midwest to help those homesick transplants. They offer a large variety of foodstuffs for everyone, whether you cook from scratch or grab the fresh ready-made grub. The deli is very comprehensive and generally reliable with the Boar's Head line.

However, shopping there today requires much more effort. Produce is hit or miss with quality and availability. I've seen grapefruit and potatoes with mold. There are many expired items on the shelves in various departments (condiments and dairy being the worst). And not just recently expired--months ago expired. You really have to take the time to scrutinize everything you purchase. Some suction seal lids are popped up on jars, even though the plastic wrap is still intact.

I still have to shop here because there are products that I can't get elsewhere, but now it's a bigger chore to ensure that I don't bring home any duds."	3	Glazier's Food Marketplace	3.5
"The food is 5 stars, but the service was a dud.

We ordered some of the signature dishes: Amberjack Crudo, Oysters, Tuna Tartare, Kim Chi Fried Rice and Chicken Wings. Everything was delicious. Every dish had a distinct and focused taste, texture and composition. The food is innovative and creative.  The flavors are powerful, unique and on point. Ingredients are fresh and of high quality. I can't wait to try the other menu items. It's great to have access to such talent  without having to head to the Strip.

Now the issue with service. The restaurant wasn't that busy. The service has to match the caliber of the food (i.e. SoHo Japanese) otherwise it's an annoyance. The oysters arrived in a timely manner, but things just dragged on and on from there. The service team doesn't seem to work as a cohesive unit, nor are they particularly excited (or versed) about the menu. You pretty much will only get the attention of your server and not anyone else. The disjointed service created a disruptive dining experience. I will try sitting at the bar next to see if that works better."	3	Other Mama	4.5
"Nice addition to the Westside! 

Bachi delivers an amazing roster of creative and delicious gourmet burgers for your palate. Our burgers were cooked exactly as requested (not always the case in this beef town). The bold flavors and ingredients that complimented the burgers were unique and well executed. The garlic chili aoili  packs a nice punch!

Their beverage list is a nice enhancement to their food menu as well. Smart planning and thinking. The decor is pleasant, hip and relaxing."	4	Bachi Burger	4
"Just don't bother. 

The restaurant seems harmless, but it is not worth having to endure mediocre food and absentee service. I noticed some of the other comments about lack of cleanliness and it is still noticeable today. The chairs and booster seats for kids looked filthy. Silverware is dull and dingy. Sometimes it's OK to spring for a new bottle of ketchup when the original labeling is nearly worn off and the cap is battered. It makes one wonder what other corners are being cut...

The food is OK, just unremarkable and unmemorable."	1	Stacks & Yolks	3.5
"A well-oiled machine! 

Everything is wonderful from start to finish. The environment is lively and attentive. The bar offerings are thoughtful and De-licious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. You can pretty much satisfy whatever strikes your mood.

Their meat dishes (steak, lamb, oxtail, etc.) usher homey\/comfy\/carnivorous flavors that are fun to discover with every bite. The salmon is nicely balanced with a generous portion of veggies. Their ingredients and seasonings are unique and deliberate, so it is a fun distraction from the ""usual-usual."" Do allow yourself to indulge in any of the specials for the evening; we've never been disappointed. I DO NOT LIKE CARROT CAKE. Their carrot cake is amazing and it vanished. Poof.

Only downside: the seating and decor could be a little more relaxed and comfortable. I get the whole warehouse\/industrial thing, but it could be a tad less rigid."	4	DW Bistro	4.5
Really enjoyed everything we ordered: brisket, ribs, pulled pork, coleslaw, mac and cheese. Can't wait to return to try the combo items. This is delicious and simple food that you want to savor and embrace. The BBQ sauces are a nice and diverse complement and are not goopy or too sweet. Highly satisfying.	4	Jessie Rae's BBQ	4.5
"I'm a big fan of the Lawry's tradition. The prime rib is great and service is usually consistent as well. This is your classic steakhouse with all the reliable rituals: juicy slabs of beef, au jus, yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, baked potato, etc. You can't go wrong with much of anything on the menu. All satisfying and delicious. Their creamed spinach is especially addicting. Dining at Lawry's is a complete experience. The decor and uniforms, the rolling cart of beef, your carver's medallion, the presentation of the spinning salad are all assembled and choreographed for a reason. They've been doing this for 75 years and are preserving history and tradition.

Disappointments: I want to give 5 stars, but the last few times we visited, I have seen more patrons dressed in sweats, dumpy t-shirts and raggedy jeans. I felt like I was eating at a food court or cafeteria. Eating here is not cheap and there's that whole classic\/custom\/tradition thing. You don't have to be in formal wear, but at least try something that is laundered. And sometimes the staff at the hostess stand seem more flighty and disorganized than necessary.

Otherwise, mmm, beeef."	4	Lawry's The Prime Rib	4
I am glad to add Del Mar Cafe as a reliable spot for breakfast. Their portions are generous and they make the effort to assemble tasty and satisfying dishes. Decadent highlights: biscuit and graaaavvvy, Man-o-War omelet, corned beef hash. Their food is consistent and thoughtfully prepared. The staff in friendly and attentive. Dining at Del Mar is a pleasant and easy experience.	4	Del Mar Cafe	4
"Finally! A shop that makes hearty and satisfying food. The sandwiches are piled high with your favorite, fresh ingredients. Portions are generous; flavors are bold. This is no cookie-cutter, fast-food sandwich chain. Treat yourself to some real food. You'll be so happy afterward.

Standouts: the Cuban, the Ruben, Eggplant Parm and the American. Fries and chips."	5	Great American Food	4
"Amazing! This is what a happy and delicious dining experience should be. 

The restaurant is casual and comfortable. The staff is genuinely friendly, enthusiastic and consistently attentive. The pasta is sooo fresh: melty, chewy and pillow-y at once. Ordered the orecchiette with sausage, mushrooms and broccolini. It was bursting with such intense and savory flavors and texture that I rolled my eyes back in delight. I was even compelled to have a glass a wine when I finished the leftovers for lunch the next day, just to keep the memory alive...

Also ordered the chicken parm, which was huge, homey and satisfying. We watched a variety of dishes go by to other smiling patrons and heard them discussing how tasty their food was. They make their own sausage, so don't deny yourself the opportunity! Dessert, espresso and cappuccino was on par with everything else. We had lots of leftovers and had to go the whole distance. 

Yes, there is an abundance of Italian restaurants in town, but Parma hits all the targets with superb service, food and atmosphere. This tops the recommendation list for anyone."	5	Parma By Chef Marc	4
"Eh. I really wanted to love this place and make it a local favorite, but Twin Creeks did not perform to expectations.

We were drawn in for the Sunday night prime rib and were looking forward to a pleasant and satisfying experience. The meal was adequate, yet nothing to rave about. The prime rib portion was generous. The taste was adequate, but mind not blown. We came early for a cocktail at the bar and were sadly disappointed by the poor quality of alcohol in their specialty drinks. We missed Happy Hour by a few minutes and the drinks looked and tasted watered down, poorly constructed and not made with the premium liquors as stated in the menu. Paid $11 each for a drink for that compared to a complimentary casino floor cocktail.

I really wanted to love this place. Our waiter also maintained a level a banality, which seemed to permeate into an uneventful evening. I did observe other tables receiving more enthusiasm from waitstaff, but it still felt like a team of misfits. My curiosity has been satisfied and it's unlikely that I need to return. I'm ready to head back to Lawry's for the real Prime experience."	2	Twin Creeks	4
Nothing special here. You might as well go to Panda Express or pick another type of food to eat.	2	Rice n Noodle	4
"So happy to have Chef Marc in the neighborhood!

The quality ingredients for your custom pies are fresh and abundant and allow for many, many delicious combinations. The dough is a tad chewy, but still handles well. Who doesn't love a fresh thin-crust pizza made to your liking and delivered to your table in minutes? The beet salad was also healthy and hearty. The decor has an industrial feel that is comfortable and casual. 

The ordering and checkout process was rather clumsy. There was confusion among the staff about who was ordering what, what to make and where you were going to sit before you paid or even turned around to look at the seating. This caused a bit of a back up as more diners arrived. This wasn't just my order, but the with the group in front of me too. The cashier asked if I wanted any gelato, but the desserts were on the other side of the room. It's hard to decide without seeing anything and not holding up the line. Maybe next time. Hopefully, these logistics will iron themselves out soon, but otherwise a wonderful food experience."	3	Novecento Pizzeria	4
"A reliable and decent Mexican restaurant with all the familiar and classic dishes. The service and attentiveness is good. Our waiter seemed to disappear a bit, but the busboy and a manager were always floating around to keep it everything moving.

Dined there for lunch and the prices did seem a tad high for the portion, but still a very positive experience overall. Good chips and salsa, carne asada and carnitas. They keep it all simple and the flavors and quality stand out."	4	Viva Mercado's	4
"Came here to see what all the fuss was about and it's true! Delicious soup and dumplings that help comfort a cold winter day. 

The hot and sour soup has bold and balanced flavors and is one of the most consistent in town. It's also fun to get that little burst of broth in your dumplings. The beef roll is a nice variation to a plain, doughy onion pancake. 

Service was nicely attentive and looking forward to sampling more of the menu next time."	4	Three Villages Restaurant	4
Sammy's is usually a reliable standby, but AVOID THIS LOCATION! The service started out fine, but then fell off a steep cliff. The food orders were wrong for our entire table, so there was big disconnect with the kitchen. They were terribly under-staffed which contributed to the chaos.	1	Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill	3.5
"WOW! What a huge disappointment. I believed all of those glowing remarks, but was confronted with a completely different experience. 

The kitchen lacks the talent and skill to create and execute traditional breakfast plates. My omlette was made like a pancake, then folded over in half and topped with sliced cheese. The eggs were cooked like a crepe and tasted thin and secondary. The ingredients did not have any interesting or fresh flavors. The meal tasted processed and assembled. BabyStacks should only focus on the pancakes because the other breakfast items are a fail. A waste of money. 

The staff is adequate and the decor is pleasant, but there isn't anything special or inspiring about this place."	2	BabyStacks Cafe	4
"The food is adequate, but not outstanding. This is a step up from Subway or Quizno's, but won't satisfy anyone who has lived in a town with a REAL classic sub shop. I ordered the Italian and the Club on a Sub. Both tasted fine, but the Club came out smashed and dilapidated.

This location also seems to have a morale problem. During my visit, I noticed the manager chastising the cashiers about who knows what. Suddenly, everyone behind the counter had a tense and sad look on their face as if this kind of treatment happens often. They are walking on eggshells back there. I think it is customary for them to yell some kind of greeting when a customer arrives, but I could barely hear\/understand the phrase because it was muffled in apathy."	2	Firehouse Subs	4
"The burgers, beer and fries are very, very good. Unfortunately, the service sucks.

It's hit or miss anytime you go. This is a very popular restaurant. They've been open long enough to get their sh*t together. They just don't seem to be able to serve customers consistently. Sometimes it is fine, other visits can be a total disaster. You can experience MIA waiters, an abandoned check-in stand and delayed or confused orders. 

The poor service really puts a damper on your dining experience and will make you forget how fun the food is. You have to be strategic about your dining times so you don't get lost in the chaos."	2	Bachi Burger	4
Went to this place for Easter Brunch and had the worst service I have ever experienced. Had to wait 30 minutes past my reservation time. Ordered dessert and never received it but it made it to my bill. Salad bar is terrible, meat mediocre. Don't waste your time and money.	1	Via Brasil Steakhouse	4
So happy to report that there is finally delicious pizza in the neighborhood! (A lot of the other stuff nearby is outright inedible.) It's classic NY-style thin crust with fresh ingredients and the flavors are nicely balanced. The crust handles nicely--not doughy or chewy; it has a nice crisp. This is pizza that I will crave and am thankful it is close by! Looking forward to sampling the many other items on their menu.	4	Rocco's NY Pizzeria	3.5
Yes! Thank you Chef John for treating us to more of your culinary genius. There is a solid range of sauce and fish combinations to satisfy everyone's palate. My go to: Twin Dragon burrito. Portions are satisfying. You will notice that the ingredients are always top notch. Staff is friendly, happy and ready to assist any newbies. A high standard is set and Soho always delivers!	5	Soho Sushi Burrito	4.5
The service is pleasant and efficient, but the food didn't match expectations. The restaurant is bright and clean, but the chairs are quite uncomfortable and rigid. It is not a relaxing environment. Breakfast was not memorable. The food was adequate and executed like someone following the steps of a recipe. This review is written like my experience: generic and uneventful.	2	Griddlecakes	4
"I really wanted to love this place. Really, really. 

Ordered the fried chicken for lunch and it did not disappoint. It had a nice spicy, crispy crust with juicy meat. There was also a spicy sauce in the condiment caddie that enhanced the flavor nicely too. Generally, all the food passing by looked good and straight-forward.

I was surprised by the price of their drinks. It really felt like you were being gauged by sheer greed. I took a pass on the $9 pint, but was even more stunned by the $4 iced tea. Plain ole Lipton Iced Tea. Those prices only motivated me to go the Yard House for beer afterward. Service was empty and awkward and made the experience rather uneventful. The energy was actually quite dull. Yes, I know it was lunch time, but the employees could try to get excited about their jobs and the dynamic environment. They didn't seem sold on the place and it transfers onto the customers."	2	Brooklyn Bowl	3.5
"Run, sprint, fly: whatever it takes to get you in this place!

Soho serves serious QUALITY food at strip-mall prices. Residents in the SW are lucky to have this restaurant in proximity. Chef\/owner John Lee and his crew execute fresh, creative and sophisticated fare. The room is casual; the service is attentive and earnest. The food will make you feel like royalty. This is not one of those drab AYCE places, so don't expect heavy sauces, gummy sushi rolls or chewy fish.

There is amazing talent in the kitchen that has access to the finest ingredients often reserved for restaurants on The Strip. A lot of care is taken in their preparation to highlight the ideal characteristic of the fish. The flavors clean, refreshing, silky, complex and complementary. That fish cradles your palate and melts in your mouth.

Order what everyone else says:
Yellowtail Yuzu Soy, Tuna Pizza, any of the Tostadas to your liking, Uni, Black Cod, Oysters, Snapper, Tuna Poke, Salmon Poke, Short Ribs. Take it all in. Ask what's good that day and just let them work their magic. You won't be disappointed (unless you're into heavy sauces, gummy rolls or chewy fish).

Once you've completed your indulging, you'll be equally delighted by your bill. C'mon, $2.00 tostadas! I don't need to go to the other sushi restaurant in the SW anymore. This is it."	5	Soho Japanese Restaurant	4.5
"Zzzzz. I had dined here and at Flamingo several times in the past, but my most recent visit was noticeably different. 

Their breakfasts are dull and bland. The menu is extensive, but their kitchen lacks the talent to create any interesting or satisfying meals. Why no hash browns at breakfast? Why the need to season and garnish everything with paprika? The house potatoes tasted processed and are diced like a chiclet. 

The service is usually pleasant and efficient, but that becomes as unmemorable when the food is flavorless. 

Save your money and keep looking."	2	Egg Works	4.5
"Sorry, but just had my last trip to this place. The sandwiches are quite good and their fries are great. Customer service is the worst. Who wants to be greeted with a sneer and scowl? It's pretty clear that the deli employee hates her job or has other uncontrollable issues. This makes the whole experience a total downer.

Pass."	1	Chip Off The Block Deli	4

I found this place years back when I stayed at this hotel and felt sick from a cold and wanted some soup.  That how I found out about this oyster bar with its used-to-be amazing clam chowder.  After that, whenever I had the chance to visit Las Vegas, I always made an effort to stop by this place to eat their clam chowder.  I also discovered some other dishes that were also very good.  I didn't know that this place has gotten so popular and the wait time increases triple the time I used to know about it.  However, after my most recent visit here, I have to say, I have seen all I needed to see.  I won't stop here next time I come to Las Vegas because it's not worth it to me anymore.  

So the seats around the bar, that is all the seats there are...approximately 10 seats or so.  There's a line, in which you get to stand on your sorry feet for a few hours until one of those few seats become available.  There is a security guard standing somewhere nearby to make sure that you are over 21 years old in order to be waiting in line.  Anyone who does not look 21 or over get asked to leave.  I was with my husband and my two years old.  We were told that my two years old son cannot be there and that we all must leave because we have a kid.  I asked why and I was told that it's because it is a bar, so nobody under 21 is allowed in there, whether you are in there just for the food, or the alcohol, they DO NOT care.  It appears that the hotel doesn't need to make money on food.  It also appears that the hotel wants you to wait long in lines, so you would get bored from waiting and play their slot machines instead.

Then the service, you finally get seated, and given a menu, then place your order and wait some more, then eat, and then pay and leave.  You get to see the chef making your food in front of your eyes.  How cool right? NOT really.  I don't really care.  I just want my food fast!!! Anyway, chefs here have this rude obnoxious looks on their faces and it's pretty annoying seating here and waiting for the food while having to endure the unpleasant atmosphere...The waitress are all annoying as well.

Prices are in the $20s each dish which is not bad.  Quality of food has gotten worse.  I tried my clam chowder again and this time it was all watery and tasted 80% WORSE than before. I guess they don't care about making GREAT food like they used to.  Decent food seems to suffice given the mass amount of customers that come here.  They seem to not care about customers.  The hotel appears to not care about the money from the food, only the money from the slot machines..

So next time in Vegas, I will NOT stop here.  It's just NOT worth it."	1	Oyster Bar	4.5
"Obviously Starbucks management don't care about their service...all the comment and bad service from long long time ago still hasn't fix and\/or improve. 
I myself experienced ""hard to believe"" bad service 2 days ago too. 
Manager was the one to start with....if manager act like that then how could you expect staff to do any better? Horrible service and horrible attitude. Wonder how they get thru a day working in that environment. Making yourself miserable been unhappy serving customer...sad. 
Never want to go there again.

Pricing is unbelievable as well. $7.50 for grande latte with caramel..."	1	Starbucks	2.5
"Opens early. Closes late. Sandwiches are good. I've tasted the Reuben and the original. Both delicious sandwiches. Meat is well seasoned for both. Bread is crunchy as well. 
Is it mind blowing? No.

It gets a bit loud, but its also a bar so what do you expect. I love their Dr.Pepper steak tacos! They are amazing and everyone should  try them! Also their french fries are yummy. I will definietly go back and have dinner again. My boyfriend enjoyed the restaurant as well.	5	Roadrunner Saloon	3
I would have to say this restaurant is one of my favorite to grab lunch at. The pizza is the perfect size for me at least, and I can't even finish the whole thing (only half), but it is delicious! I always get the Wild Mushroom Pizza and it is the most amazing pizza I have ever had. If you are a mushroom fan, this is one of the meals that you have to try. Our waitress and waiters are always friendly and are on top of their game ! I do not think there is one thing I can say bad about this place! I love it!	4	California Pizza Kitchen	3.5
"Best italian food I ever had! We stayed in Vegas for 4 days. Went to the Rio and Bellagio buffets and they are nothing compared to Cuginos! 

We had the:
Sicilian tripe soup- OMG!!! I'm craving as I type!

Garlic knots- yummy! My 5 yr old devoured it right away

Cheese pizza- best I've ever had!

Reuben melt- amazing! Lots of meat! 

#1 italian sandwich- yummy!

Rice balls (meat and cheese)- yummy!! And the marinara sauce- OMG! Owner said they cool the sauce for 4 hrs.

Jamaican patty- it was good but overshadowed by the rest of the meal.

Frutti di mare- a-mazing! Lots of seafood! Yummy sauce!

What the place lacks in ambiance and presentation, the make up for the taste and quality of their food. And in the end, that's all that matters!"	5	Cugino's Italian Deli & Pizza	4.5
Stopped here on Memorial Day for lunch because our first choice for Mediterranean food was closed.  We were they only customers in the restaurant the whole time we were in there.  The person at the counter seemed bothered that my wife and I were only getting 2 gyros and a side of fries to share and not interested in getting full meals or soft drinks.  He seemed unfriendly and a bit rude.  We did order 2 ice waters which never came.  I also don't like the tablet at the counter that asks how much you want to tip... is tipping necessary when you order from a counter and bus your own table?  I did leave a tip, however, because I was afraid he would only become more upset with us if I didn't!  The food was good but the sauce was a bit lacking.  There is no public restroom in the restaurant, nor in the strip mall that we could find, and not even at the gas station 4 blocks south... ???  We ended up driving to Walmart for restrooms and water!  I am usually not very picky but stopping here for lunch left me feeling disappointed and ended up interfering with our plans for the day.	1	Kabob Express	4.5
"I feel like 3 Stars is pretty generous for the review on this place. First service was horrible. I think we only saw our waitress once after we ordered eventually having to track down a manager just to get our check and then left cash so we didn't have to wait longer. 

Chicken and waffle was way overpriced for what it was. It was just fried chicken and one waffle. Nothing exciting about the flavoring or anything of the fried chicken. The syrup was a nice touch but not worth the $36 for fried chicken and a waffle. 

The menu is very small for a brunch menu. Not a lot of options. Luckily we were seated next to the kitchen and after not seeing anything my husband liked he saw a burger come out of the kitchen and asked the waitress. She was very reluctant to bring us the dinner menu and when she did told us the only thing we could order off it was the burger ( it was 1 in the afternoon not 9 in the morning) but then we continued to see sandwiches and other dinner items come out of the kitchen while waiting for our food. The poached egg dish had a very odd overpowering lemon flavor to the sauce that ruined the whole dish. The burger was super greasy. 

We ordered the peach cobbler instantly cause we had friends tell us it was fantastic (again nothing overly special) and still ended up waiting for it forever after our meal.  

Wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it. Maybe it's better for the cocktails!"	3	Yardbird Southern Table & Bar	4.5
Fantastic!  Hash browns were amazing breakfast quesadilla was awesome biscuits and gravy were just as fantastic.  Service was good. Very nice chatty waiter. After a horrible experience at yardbirds the day before this was a nice treat!!  May go back tomorrow!	5	Grand Lux Cafe	4
Took my dad here for his 70th birthday. What a treat!  Steak was melt in your mouth amazing. Crab legs were better than the stone claws but the sauce they served with them was fantastic.

"Yummy nachos!!!!! i ordered the volcano nachos and when it came out all i could say was wow they were huge. My boyfriend and i couldn't even eat half of it, and we love to eat. We ended up taking the rest home and i couldn't even close the box it was so full. My boyfriend ordered the mushroom burger (we didn't know the nachos would be so big) it was pretty average burger. 
The service was great. If you don't like to be bother while you eat i don't recommend this place. There's loud music, guys and girls on stilts walking around making balloon animals, women in bikinis walking around trying to get you to donate to Save The Tatas, and a girl sliding down into a big margarita. Overall i had fun food was alright at best but the nachos are amazing. Of course they had really good margaritas..."	4	Margaritaville	3.5

"While visiting Las Vegas we wanted to desperately  escape the overpriced low-quality  food from the hotels on the strip. Thank you Yelpers for your help  finding this jewel!
We arrived 30 min before closing and we were welcomed as if they just opened their doors. 
Our server Jacob made some suggestions since this was our first time here and  we were not familiar with the menu. I had the special: short ribs, two eggs, garlic rice and for the perfect ending German cake pancakes.
Hubby ordered the pork egg Benedict.
Oh boy...what a breakfast!!
Food came out super quick. Everything was delicious, cooked to perfection, the ribs were unbelievable.  Tender, juicy...could have been a rib eye. That good!! Thanks again to Jacob for this suggestion and for keeping my cup of coffee full at all times.  He was very attentive.
The pancakes...ufff....to die for. I can't describe it...just have them."	5	BabyStacks Cafe	4
"In desperate need of an experience manager.
Friday morning. No 2% or fat free milk for drinks  (only soy, almond and whole  we are told). No biggie for me since I drink my americano milk and sugar-free but I was also getting a nutella latte. 
Cashier probably in training because he was clueless. Ordered a fruit tart (pastry shelf was almost empty, not many options) and he had to go get help to identify  it. (???)  and almost handled food without gloves! We had to stop him.
He also struggled to get our drinks in the computer and didn't know how to determined if the reward program  awarded us a free drink today. Asked us a name for the order...
4 people in the batista area. Chatting and  One drink is sitting there.  Someone else has to ask again if I ordered an americano and what size was it. ( cashier had ask me already 3 times) so, they don't have a system to follow up on orders?
So it happens that the drink sitting there was the nutella latte, but  in spite of asking for a name for the order they just don't use it. 
I love good coffee and sambalatte  has it.  I have been to the strip location many times but this  location needs attention  really bad."	1	Sambalatte Torrefazione	4

"One star for breakfast, based on the value. 
I ordered the breakfast panini, a cup of coffee, and a bear claw; and that came to $21. The menu promised a high class version of the classic breakfast sandwich, but the cooks did not deliver. I received two pieces of plain white bread with some grill marks on the outside. Inside there was a touch of lunchmeet ham - the kind where you can see the pressmarks through the package at the grocery - a small over-hard egg, and melted Velveeta. For an $11 sandwich, I am used to receiving the heavenly goodness of Zingerman's Deli in Ann Arbor, an equally overpriced town, and that I happily pay for. Jean Philippe left me feeling angry and abused.

The bear claw was decent, and the coffee was OK."	1	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
Stopped by as I was walking through Caesar's for a quick snack, and sat at the bar. The server recommended the Scotch Egg and pub chips (fries). She was friendly and efficient, and correct on the recommendation. Both items, while simple, were done to perfection. The chips were about a third of a potato or more each, and you got eight, so quite a bit of potato. They were crispy on the outside and just right on the inside. The house made ketchup was good enough to eat without putting it on the chips. It was my first scotch egg, so I don't have much to compare, but I enjoyed the contrast of the spicy sausage, egg, and slightly molten yoke. yum!	4	Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill	3.5
"I am a huge fan of the beer selection and happy hour, not so much on the food. As a beer aficianado, I was impressed by the choices of beer on the menu. Not an overwhelming list, just a good list. Happy hour makes this one of the most affordable places in Vegas to drink, too. Also, Todd gives away free beer on the 7-second challenge. He cheats a little by making you start and finish with the glass on the table, which takes a second and a half out of the time, so a 5.5-second slam if you can. Good for two free beers a night.
Also they have four cask beers on pump, but I was mislead by the menu when it appeared they had a custom bourbon cask beer, when in reality they have a custom bourbon, AND four cask beers but they are unrelated. 
The rib-eye chili was nothing to write home about."	5	Todd English P.U.B.	3.5

"Hi Everyone,

With high hopes of finding a better Chinese delivery restaurant than China-A-Go-Go and China AAA, we tried China Joe's on Eastern for the first time on 3\/9\/17. We had every intention of posting a positive review for our first delivery, but never got the chance as we placed our second order on 3\/21\/17. Our first experience on 3\/9 was pretty good with the exception of the 45 minute delivery wait time. 

We ordered 2 individual dinner boxes at $8.25 each, which includes 1-choice of rice or lo mein noodles,  1-side  dish and 1-choice of entree. My husband ordered the Orange Chicken while I ordered Kung Po Shrimp, which cost $1.00 extra [for shrimp]. China Joe's did not disappoint and made a great first-impression with [their] tasty egg rolls and lo mein noodles. 

We ordered again on 3\/21\/2017 - this time around I ordered Kung Po Chicken and my husband ordered Teriyaki Chicken. We both ordered the lo mein and added 1 full order of egg rolls to include extra dipping and soy sauce, with an emphasis on ""dont forget to bring chopsticks"".

Unfortunately, our entire meal was a BIG disappointment. The egg rolls were ice cold and ""blah"" tasting - blah, blah, blah... AND the chicken on both entrees was so tough that we had to chew, chew, and keep chewing just to get thru our meals lol. We only ate enough to satisfy ""our hunger pangs"", then threw the rest away in the garbage can -  which meant, NO Chinese leftovers for breakfast or lunch the following day - a total bummer :(. Also, my driver forgot to bring our chopsticks, IS a big part of the dining experience in my opinion. 

We did not bother to call and complain. To be frank, I am growing very tired of the lack of consistency and subpar food when it comes to delivery and takeout dining. We've decided to simply move past this bad experience and continue our quest to find a suitable Chinese restaurant that delivers quality food in our area.

Since our first dining experience with China Joe's was favorable, we gave them 2 stars. As for our 2nd visit, we reluctantly give China Joe's 1 star as the Yelp site does not offer patrons the ability to rate a company at zero stars or below.   

[Post script] -  I just learned that China Joe's uses third-party delivery companies such as GrubHub to deliver its food orders. Since I live only a few blocks away, it now makes sense why both deliveries took over 45-minutes for delivery."	2	China Joe's	2.5
I love Hash House A Go Go - but prefer the non-casino variants.  The one in San Diego is amazing as is the one off Sahara in Las Vegas.  I have gone to most of them, and do like the food.  There's something about a free standing Hash House Building, however, that really themes the experience.	3	Hash House A Go Go	4
Burger Bar is always a treat.  Long Lines, and a small bar can be frustrating, but ALWAYS worth the wait.  All their ingredients are top quality, including meats.  What's surprising is how Amaze-balls their Veggie burgers are.  I'm not a Vegetarian, but this is my go-to there.	4	Burger Bar	4
This place was wonderful compared to the Ventian hotel pasta. The prices were cheap, and big portion of food. The bread was so yummy as well! I will come here again!	5	Pasta Mia West	4
Mini bf steak, fresh man, and mushroom ball were my favorite. Also good price of al la cart. Friendly staffs and nice food.	5	Jjanga Japanese Restaurant	4
We stopped for the lunch buffet to try out some Indian food. The buffet was not huge, but it was tasty and was kept fresh with food. The restaurant itself is nothing special, not a lot of ambiance, but it was clean and our server was friendly. For us it was a good introduction to Indian food with a nice sampling of dishes at a good price.	3	Urban Turban	4

LOVE LOVE LOVE of my life!  Well, second only to my immediate family.  I couldn't just choose one!  I had a red velvet cupcake, and please keep in mind I am a cupcake snob!  I don't do "homemade".  It was out of this world with cream cheese filling, soooooo sooooo good.  I also got a cheese pastry so good, I googled to see if there was a miracle shop like this near me, sadly there is not.  Trust that this is a must stop!	5	Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian Casino	4
This was my first time at Beerhaus and Marlo made my experience the best ever. She recommended an IPA and I loved it! I will definitely be coming back!	5	Beerhaus	4
Amazing authentic Yucatan food. Not your traditional "Tex-Mex" Americanized cuisine.	5	Chicken Itza	4.5
Visited Border Grill for a breakfast event and was treated to some delicious food to start the day. From I recall I tried Peruvian Shrimp and Grits, Bread Pudding French Toast, and my favorite was the Bacon Jalapeño PBJ, Nice location inside Mandalay Bay and look forward to coming back again for their Sunday Brunch.	4	Border Grill	4
"A friend told me about Sin City Sushi after they opened this location. This past Friday we decided to go for All-You-Can-Eat lunch. I had been craving sushi for a while so I was ready and was not disappointed. 

Located in the shopping center (Eastern\/Serene)  the exterior is nothing fancy but upon entering the interior was simple, clean and with other Asian restaurants, specifically Japanese\/Sushi, you are greeted right away. The staff were all great and made us feel very welcome. 

We ended up going after 12PM which turned out to be great timing. It wasn't that busy so we easily got seated up at the sushi bar. The main chef was very nice and quick with preparing various rolls. 
One of my favorite rolls that I find just about everywhere is the Dragon Roll. It was as delicious as ever. Upon recommendation from the chef I had their Stacie Roll and loved it. My friend had their Moon Roll and Vampire Roll so I sampled both and added to my list for next time. After doing some of the larger rolls I need to get my nigiri fix with some Salmon, Hamachi and upon the chef's recommendation tried their Albacore which was prepared spicy. Loved it all and although I was stuff I couldn't leave without some strawberry mochi. 

This will be one I definitely visit again, hopefully sooner than later. Next time I plan on doing All-You-Can-Eat dinner with some tasty beer to wash down some rolls."	4	Sin City Sushi	4
"I'm a fan. Visited this past weekend for a late dinner. It was not busy. Immediately greeted upon walking in and got seated right away. The seating in the booths is a bit narrow. I liked the decor and ambiance inside. 

Our server visited us within a timely manner to greet us, offer chips & salsa, answer any questions and offer to take our drink order. We ordered a blood orange margarita and a cadillac margarita. Both were good. 

We ended up ordering the stuffed jalapenos as an appetizer - they were great! For our entree we ordered the braised carnitas and enchilidas poblanos, happy with both!

Ordered the Tequila Lime Cheesecake which was delicious. 

Overall we enjoyed our dinner here. The service and food were great and we plan to visit again."	4	Casa Del Matador	3.5
If you are coming out to the Speedway to visit Exotics Racing then Race Day Cafe is a great place to stop for breakfast or lunch. They have a great menu including burgers, sandwiches, salads and wraps. Friendly staff, great prices and fast service. They have a few tvs also playing various sports.	5	Mo's Race Day Cafe	4
Went here for dinner recently and was pleasantly surprised. I had heard about it but didn't know what to expect. Cool decor inside and friendly service. Amazing selection of beers. Prices are great and I totally underestimated my appetite. I ordered 4 tacos and was getting full after 2. They pile on the meat and everything was delicious. Great little patio area to sit and enjoy. Definitely will be coming back again soon!	5	Yayo Taco	3.5
Wanted to go to Burger Bar but too long of a wait so went to Hussongs for lunch and had a completely different experience than my first visit. Service was POOR. It wasn't much busier than my first visit. The server mentioned their computers were having problems. During the time we were there I saw what looked like the manager helping take orders and another gentleman who was wearing street clothes start bringing guests chips\/salsa. I was bummed. Took awhile to get our check and then wait longer for someone to run the card. After we left and were just a few feet away from the restaurant a gentleman asked us if we had just ate at Hussongs and how it was. We answered "it was OK but the service was slow". I am changing my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars. I don't think I will be back anytime soon.	2	Hussong's Cantina Las Vegas	3.5
"I visited Fogo de Chão this week for lunch and it was great. 

Salad Bar: You can easily fill up on the salad bar. Great selection and everything looked fresh.

Meats: The usual meats offered at other Brazilian steakhouses and everything I had was delicious. I often had to turn my card over so I could work on finishing what was starting to pile up. 

Service: Service was great, plenty of attention with drink refills, offering meats, etc. There was a pretty decent lunch crowd but each time I turned my card over instantly someone was by my table ready to offer more meat."	5	Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse	4.5
Happy they opened a location in Summerlin! Friendly staff and delicious food. Love the Truffle Egg Sandwich and Cinnamon Biscuits. Will definitely be having breakfast more often.	5	Eat Summerlin Proper	4
"Made reservations for this past weekend. Upon arriving, no one was at the host stand. After waiting a few minutes, a server came to the host stand to get us seated. Turns out this was going to also be our server. This was my second time here. First was good, did not recall any issues. Unfortunately this visit was not so great. 

Service was not good and it was not that busy. The bar area looked fairly busy but it was just as happy hour was ending. The dining room area was not busy. After being seated and getting some water to start, we waited for the server to come back to get our drink order. By the time drinks came back, we were ready to order. After placing our order (main plus a side). the server came back to inform us they were out of mashed potatoes. Really? Um, ok. So I picked another side. Once we did get our food, the steaks were luke warm. Being hungry and not having a server check on us or both trying to flag down someone else, we just took what we got.

Unlike other restaurants where the server stops by to check on things, we didn't see much of our server after that. I remember one visit to check after we had our food and take a second drink order. Once finished and plates were cleared we wanted to get the check, but where was the server? No where to be seen. Then he shows up to ask about dessert and leave a menu, which we declined and just asked for the check. Soon as we got the check, I put my CC in hoping to have it taken back promptly, but no, the server disappeared again. After the check with my CC was sitting for a bit, someone else offered to take it for us. That other server than came back by to let us know our server was taking care of it. 

In the end, I was disappointed since I know this is a popular place, they have a great drink menu and on my previous visit loved the food. However this recent visit was not worth a higher rating. I most likely won't be coming back anytime soon. There are too many other great restaurants in Las Vegas."	3	Herbs & Rye	4
Stopped in here on the way home from work to pick up some pizza for dinner. When you walk in you instantly smell the delicious hot pizzas coming out of the ovens. Ordered 2 different pizzas and didn't wait too long. I was too hungry at the time of ordering to look over the menu for long but I'm not a big fan of thin crust normally however it was still good nonetheless. I'll have to brush up on the menu and I am sure I will be picking up pizza from here again in the future.	4	Rosati's Pizza	3.5
"As long as I have lived in Las Vegas I had never dined at Hofbrauhaus. Very glad to say I have finally done so and look forward to going back again! Have plenty of friends who rave about it and it lived up to my expectations. 

Service was great, staff were friendly and helpful. Food was great. I along with a few friends ordered #365. They always order that and after checking the menu I decided to give it a try. Loved it. 

This is not for a quiet dinner. If that is what you were looking for then you chose wrong and it's not their fault. That's like saying you go to Oktoberfest to read books and relax. No, you go to have fun and drink. That is what Hofbrauhaus provides. A fun place for drinking and good German food. Very simple formula and since it's been here for quite a few years now, they must be doing it right. 

Look forward to going back again soon!"	4	Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas	3.5
I've been here for lunch a couple times in the past with clients and most recently for Sunday football. Service is usually pretty good, especially when you have a few people with you regularly ordering drinks and apps. One of my favorites to get is their Mozzarella String Cheese Sandwich. Just what it sounds like...mozzarella string cheese melted between 2 pieces of bread. It's great and helps soak up some beer during the game.	4	Fireside Restaurant & Tavern	3.5
"I was craving AYCE sushi so I went here with a friend that had already been once last week. It is very new and they were still finalizing some of the outdoor heating on the patio. The location is great and I especially liked the roll-up door that provides a sushi bar for the patio. 

I think the servers are new to working in a sushi restaurant but they were friendly and provided good customer service. If you have been to a sushi restaurant and know what you like or want you shouldn't have any problems. 

They have a very nice decor inside with a large wine room behind glass, along with additional seating further back in the restaurant. We sat up at the sushi bar enjoying a nice afternoon view. They had similar variety of rolls and appetizers you can find at many of the sushi restaurants, along with a few I had not heard of or had before. 

The sushi chefs working at the time of my visit were very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. We were given a complimentary Hamachi salad to try. I found a new favorite roll which was the Yoshi Dynamite. With our mochi dessert our server included a half sample of red bean to try. 

We left totally full and very satisfied. Their AYCE lunch was $19.95 and I thought was a great deal, considering how much I ate. 

Overall I enjoyed eating here and thought the food was great. I will look forward to visiting again."	4	Xtreme Sushi & Sterling Steakhouse	2
Stopped in for breakfast one morning. Good food for a fair price. Good service as well. It's a perfect little neighborhood place I plan to visit again.	4	Blue Ox Central	4
"Was over at the Double Down and wanted to get something to eat while waiting for a band to go on. My friend recommended we check out Cottage Cafe. Although we arrived as they were closing up for the night, the owner was extremely kind and offered to let us order something. It was like super VIP, we had the place to ourselves, and were treated like regular guests, not rushed. 

We ordered some spicy beef and lamb with veggies to split. And had to get some Ethiopian beer to wash it down. I had no idea what to expect and was thoroughly satisfied when the food came out. My first time eating here and I will plan on coming back again. The taste and portion you get for the price is great, you can't beat it.

I'm curious to try breakfast next time. I'm a fan and have already recommended some other friends to try it."	5	Cottage Cafe	3.5
Big Ern's BBQ is a great place to stop in for lunch or dinner when visiting Downtown LV. Small dining area inside and patio seating outside is nice when the weather is right. You'll find your typical BBQ items and sides here. I've been here a few times now and will come back again.	4	Big Ern's BBQ	3.5
"Always enjoy Baja Fresh. Good menu and the food is freshly prepared. I usually always get the Baja Steak Burrito but the tacos, salads and rest of the menu are equally good.
The salsa bar is great, they have a nice choice of freshly prepared salsa for topping off your meal. I like that you get a small side of chips to go with your burrito. Would much rather go to Baja Fresh than a fast food burger joint."	5	Baja Fresh	3

"Was introduced to Buldogis via their food truck at a recent foodie fest. After learning they had a physical location as well, I recently stopped by to check it out since they had even more to offer. Nice location, near Chicago Brewing Company. They have a great selection of unique hot dogs, burgers and sides. 
Service and food were great. I had the Angry Dog. I'm sure I will stop in again another time and try something new."	4	Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dogs	4.5
I got a ticket asking me to come back after 6 hours. I came back one hour earlier but still waited 3 hours to sit. The total wait is 9 hours to get a table!!! This is terrible, don't come, idiot!	1	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"I was in Vegas at the beginning of June for a bachelorette party, and we came here on Friday night before going out. I LOVED this place!! First of all, it's gorgeous. It reminded me of a jungle, lots of dark colors. Very pretty.

Our server was totally sweet. She explained the menu really well and helped me order something I would actually like since I'm not normally a sushi lover. I think the roll I got was the Neo Tokyo. And it was sooo good! Very satisfying flavor, savory and sweet at the same time. A little expensive I thought, but alas.

Considering there were like 15 of us on a busy night, the service was pretty fast. We got our food and drinks in a really timely manner and I didn't feel like we were sitting around waiting that much.

A downside was that I felt as though we were surrounded by creepy men, but that's so often par for the course that I can't fault Samba. 
 
Very fun place. And really interesting bathrooms."	5	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
"I really don't understand the positive feedbacks that drove me here. I was looking for a quiet place to avoid the sand storm outside. I went to this indoors cafe expecting good coffee and a nice place.

- We took a Mocha Latte and a Hot chocolate. Both were terrible, any coffee from the 7-11 next door would have been better.
- Also, there pastries look like home-made (a little messy), but are just average in taste.
- The prices are high for bad quality beverages.
- The coffee place doesn't have its own place, it is shared with the Center Lobby, which means : you're just sitting in a place with a lot of coming and going of people not even taking anything in the coffee.
- You keep seeing the center officer reprimanding people in the space for not sitting right or whatever, like in a Library.
- There was a Wifi access point that said Bronze Cafe but that one was ""not open to the public"" ... so, you had to use the center Wireless, which doesn't work that well.

Well, if you want to relax, this coffee doesn't deserve the effort. You can have a better experience by taking a coffee at the 7-11 and enjoying the free wifi and seats at the Center in front of Bronze Cafe, or simply by looking to one of the numerous better places !"	1	Bronze Cafe at The Center	4.5
Second time enjoying brunch here. It was delicious. Even though they were packed to the max the server was great and super friendly. I will come back for sure to visit them again.	5	Eat.	4
Came in to timbers to have dinner with friends. Our waitress Kylie seemed annoyed from the second we sat down. We placed our order and she didn't even bring out our appetizers until our food was out. She threw down our food and then dropped the check saying she needed to get out of here fast so she could finish up and go home. After 5 mins she came back to our table and said can I take your check. When we said no, she rolled her eyes. After another 10 mins she asked if we were finished because she really wanted to go home early. Then we asked for a dessert menu and she laughed and said "no we don't have one", "why does everyone ask me that",? After that she continued to tell us she was so excited to go home. Then she insulted my friends and I by calling one of them my mother when we are friends and close in age. Which was an uncalled for comment. Once she took our bill she returned with it and proceeded to tell us what you needed to tip her and that we should tip her more. When I asked for a small box, my friend giggled, just because she giggles a lot. The server then proceeded to tell us how she experimented pot and how her email address was inappropriate. She kept making references to narcotics? I love Timbers, and their food! I don't want this girl ruining others experiences when they go there. I am very disappointed in how we were treated. All of us at the table have worked or does work in the food service Industry and just shocked of how poorly the service was we received. I will not return to this location.	1	Timbers - Azure	3.5
I went down to Hexx with my sisters and a good friend.  It was the perfect location!  We sat outside on the patio and was able to see the fountains and do some great people watching.  The patio stayed nice and cool in the heat with the misters.  Our waitress was amazing and very attentive.  The brocollini was amazing along with everything else we got.  I ate bone marrow and was obsessed with it!!!  Anyway, I totally recommend Hexx.	5	HEXX kitchen + bar	4

This was our first time coming to Oyshi and we will definitely come again! The food was delivered in a timely manner and tasted delicious! My boyfriend is allergic to avocado and cucumber (unfortunately) so finding good sushi can be a bit hard for him. Our waitress, Odi, was very cooperative and made sure that whatever he ordered was completely free of his allergies! I also noticed that she was really busy, every table in the place packed, however she remained very calm and checked on us frequently to make sure we had the food we needed and that we were doing okay. Thank you Odi for making our first experience a great one! We will be returning soon!	5	Oyshi Sushi	3.5
I would give this place 5 stars if it was based solely on how tasty the food is! I come here very frequently because I seriously can't get enough of the food but some of the employees are in such a rush to get you down the line, they don't even smile or say hello. They have also messed up my salads multiple times by not checking what is written on the top of the box (usually saying no onions and they put onion on). Overall love the food, and some of the employees are nice, just needs a little more upbeat customer service.	4	Cafe Zupas	3.5

"Got the filet mignon benedict. This was mediocre at best. Food was lukewarm. Hash brown had a cheesy topping, mostly mushy, without the crispness. The medallions was chewy... And the muffin it was on tasted like it was from the grocery store.

"GO HERE! Seriously, that gambling budget you have, spend it at these tables instead. 

Service: What you expect from a place like this. Different bread and dessert combination for our table of 4, server remembered exactly what we each wanted. Only delay was the main entree because we ordered the hen (whole hen) that takes a while to cook. 

Food: Yes, yes, and yes. Forget whatever food you had tasted before. From the butter to the foie gras, better versions than any other place I've ever been to. The bread was just medium to transport more butter to my mouth =D. 

Price: I don't drink so that affects the bill a lot. Expect at least $300 per person, this place can easily run into the thousands of dollars if you want. 

Overall: Most expensive meal of my life, BEST meal of my life. Totally worth it."	5	Joël  Robuchon	4.5
"It's alright, never got the hype. I went 2 shake shacks one in NY and one in Las Vegas, though years apart. Food was ok here, can definitely tell it's a teir above the fast food joints like Burger King. 

Bad experiences with food: 

- Shack Attack Shake. Got this in NY. Wayy too chocolately. 
- Secret Sauce: tastes of pickles... I hate pickles. So this was definitely a personal thing, but ruined the burger for me. 

Other than that, the place in Vegas is nice and clean, helpful staff."	3	Shake Shack	4
"Got the Man vs Food favorite, Sage Fried Chicken with mashed potates, biscuts, etc. It'll be $25 after tip, but it's ginormous. Dish easily must've weighed 2lbs. Girl next to me was full after 4-5 bites. I got about 3\/4 through it. This can easily feed 2 people. 

I would suggest people hop over to the bar seating to skip the 45 min line. Some couples did it and we were happy to scoot one seat over for them."	5	Hash House A Go Go	4

Ok I had to update my review because each time I've been there since they opened I've seen much improvements. I know it's just because they just opened. The food is much better, everything from the meats, shrimp patty to the finadene. Very authentic that's for sure. Sodium levels improved so it wasn't overwhelming. Last 3 times I've seen improvements so I am happy and will definitely be back with some friends. I really appreciated the service, making exceptions on certain things for me & the lil things to show the island spirit. If you haven't tried this place - it's a must for everyone having Guam food for the first time to being born on Guam.	4	Red Rice	4.5

"I am a boba addict & give this place a 5 star! The tea is good quality & they have great customer service unlike other boba places (like Tea Station which I used to go to a lot - not anymore!) 

They are so good at catering to my particular taste buds & how i like my drink that they even have my recipe on the wall since I go there everyday! Thats impressive and makes me feel very welcomed unlike other boba places. 

The staff is welcoming & you can tell they are sincere. I totally recommend this place to everyone!

And... A bonus is... Their Regular size is larger than a Large size at any other place ive been to! Love it!!"	5	Tea Space	4.5
Hmmm, what is the hype about??? The place is small with no seats, food is less than ordinary, service is just ok - nothing special. Menu is limited youd think they would specialize in what they serve? Nope! Wont be coming back!	1	The Halal Guys	3.5
I hate this place! I used to come here everyday for 10+ yrs! Yes - 10 yrs! Not a typo. I am addicted to boba. You'd think that for someone who comes everyday they would treat you better. Not this place! They are petty about the stuff that doesn't matter - buying a gift card so you can earn stamps, putting too much ice and if you ask for less they give you attitude because this is how they cheat you with the amount of tea there is in a drink. I get it. Business is business. However for someone who brings so much business at a ridiculous mark up! I pay just a lil under $7 per drink! Times that everyday for 10+ years. I tolerate their rude ass service because I do like their drinks. We dont have much options like CA does so I continued to go! Not anymore!!! Thank god I found a place that has better everything - better service, drinks & price! That's Icy Juicy on Spring Mtn\/Jones! I pay $4ish for my drink & because I come everyday they treat me great! The best value is at Icy Juicy. Authentic taiwanese drinks for less w\/ wayyyyy better service you cant go wrong!  Today after not going to Tea Station for 3 years now (and counting cuz I took my business else where)... I came back & imagine they told me they couldnt serve me my Rose milk tea (apparently they still remember me) with less ice which is how I ask it. Excuse me a-hole?? You want to charge me for a cup full of ice & have the nerve to tell me that I can only get it with regular ice? Did you forget Im the customer & i dont like my drinks watered down? Plus I pay $7 for it? I told them I will go else where & I tell you this - I will never be back! Management doesnt care either. A bunch of cheap chinese shit heads here! If you read this - ask your drink with LESS ice so you dont pay for a cup full of ice with less drink! Dont let them full you. But seriously go to Icy Juicy instead! Ppl just dont know abput them. The owner of Icy Juicy used to work at Tea Shitation!! He brought the same if not better quality for less! Tea Shitation has lost me as a customer forever as well as my referrals cuz i know a lot of ppl! But they dont care - And neither do I!	1	Tea Station	3
This place has gone downhill big time!! I am regular customer and last few times I waited an hour for me food! Wth!!!! They were not even busy and ladies standing around with their terrible attitude. You can tell by their body language! Very bad! I left pissed after an hour & only one other table today I waited 1 hr?????? Seriously!!!! Their food is not that good to wait for! Oh pls! Workers there are terrible!! Not worth it!!	1	Shish Kabob House	4
Feel very disappointed coming here. I wanted Teppanyaki and I understand I am by myself so they cooked it at the back. Everything was less than ok. Miso soup had bad seaweed cuz been sitting all day. Salad was not fresh. Worst of all the food came put so fast & was just so bad. Not fresh. You can tell its been sitting there. I mean if im going to pay the regular price why should the quality be that much less. I recommend if going for teppanyaki have them cook it in front of u. After all its the same price. I gave 2 stars cuz the server, a young korean guy, was very accommodating & genuinely apologetic. I honestly dont think ill be back unfortunately. There is a place Ohjah nearby that i go to and recommend over this place. In the end, I dont even get a thank you from cashier after paying.	2	Sushi Tower & Steakhouse	4
This place is an under-rated place! If you havent tried it - its a must! Amazing food with fair prices & great service! You cant go wrong!	5	Trattoria Nakamura-Ya	4.5
Change of ownership.  Preferred previous owners & the quality of food before.	3	Mi Ga	4
This is the best Thai restaurant I have been to. The Garlic Prawns is a must! Tried a few dishes & everything is amazing! I recommend this to all the foodies out there!	5	Lotus of Siam	4
2 stars at its best. I'm being nice. I was very disappointed in their food. Ambience is good just the food sucks!	2	Lucky Foo's Restaurant & Bar	4
Terrible food. Nice Ambience in great location. Price is high for food that isnt gpod. Im Asian so i know real asian food. The lobster fried rice which is $17 is prob the worst fried rice ive ever had. Corn in fried rice? How is that supposed to be asian? Female waitress was the nicest. The asian waiters are typical chinese jerks who give off the energy that they only care about money not caring if ur happy of not. I dont see this place making it! Terrible!	1	Rice Republic	3
I come here everyday! They have the best value - Authentic taiwanese drinks @ the best prices with good service (they are nice to me because I come everyday and they know me but this is something that has improved from when I first started coming.) But I recommend this place to everyone!	5	Icy Juicy	3
Honestly I am NOT a fan. I did not enjoy their food at all. It was almost torturing to eat. I ordered the Mushu chow mein, pork & leek dumplings and chicken with mushroom noodles. Played with the food and had to call family to come and help me eat it because I really hate wasting food. The service was ok. The Chinese waiter and waitress are typical Chinese people who rush you. Only good thing I can say about this place is that they make the noodles fresh (even though I'd rather have not fresh noodles cause it taste better)... and the location is convenient. Other than that I don't think I'll ever come back!	1	The Noodle Man	4
What a hidden gem. Food is great! Price is so fair. Relaxing atmosphere. And service is on point! What more can you ask for? This is my 2nd time here after discovering this place last week and i will for sure come back. Only thing I would say is the spice level is higher than normal so adjust accordingly. But now I know. I highly recommend this place!	5	I Am Thai Cuisine	4.5
This review is for the Hibachi cooked in the kitchen without the "show". I'm not impressed at all. Way too saucy and salty! Fried rice was drenched in butter. Felt like I might have a heart attack after. Oh my! I guess some people like that but this was just way too much. Service was good but if food isn't good enough I won't be back, unfortunately. I might be willing to try their sushi though.	2	Bonsai Japanese Steak & Sushi	4
Seriously, I would never come back! The service is ok but the food is just so... Im lost for words. I ordered the korean chicken, musubi, etc. The chicken was full of batter and I felt like I was going to get a heart attack just looking at it. The musubi was sitting for a while and was just below average. I guess it represents the name as Express but seriously... if you want better quality food, just go next door to Jun's in the same building! I was debating between the two and because I always go to Juns I figured id try this place out. Never again!	1	Island Flavor 	4.5
Terrible first experience. How do you run out of rice? I mean I guess it happens but you should really be prepared if you are running a business. I'm Asian so I need my rice or I won't be satisfied. Ugh, waited 30+ mins for it. So annoying when you are starving. Their food is ok. Not bad but but nothing special.	1	The Great Greek	4.5
If I can give this place 10 stars, I would! Good food,  good price & exceptional service. I've been here many times and was never disappointed.  Only once I said it was just "ok" and to my surprise the chef made me something special to make up for my dissatisfaction with my food.  The staff (especially Shiela) rocks!  Always going the extra mile to make sure customers are happy.  The price is amazing for what you get. I recommend this place to everyone!	5	Soho Japanese Restaurant	4.5
The best buffet in Las Vegas. I love the single serving items and it feels like real food from a real good restaurant and not the typical buffet standards.	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"5 Stars!!! If I could give 6 I would. 

I am super picky when it comes to my boba drinks. It took a few times to adjust a few things but now I got my drink down! I come I and they remember my order! I'm very impressed. Even when something is off, they gladly fix it without the attitude you'll find at most places. 

High Quality tea 
Excellent customer service 
Great Price 
Close to home 

What more can I ask for? Highly recommend!"	5	Brew Tea Bar	5
What an awesome experience! The wait was a little longer than quoted but understandable; Sunday brunch and we wanted to be on the patio. When we were seated, the hostesses apologized. The food was pretty awesome but what really made our experience so awesome was our waitress and the staff. Cheryl was so amazing! We had a child with us who was a picky eater and she was so patient and accommodating; got the little guy everything he wanted. Throughout the meal, she was always so attentive and always made sure we had fresh bread (incredible). At the end of the meal, she showed us the rewards program. I can't say enough about how awesome she was! Will definitely come back on our next visit.	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
We went here late at night for the garbage can nachos and they were fantastic. Over indulgent, yes, but they hit the spot.	4	Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar	3.5
Start off with oxtail chili cheese fries run move into the kiki's burger... By then no room for dessert! So amazing	5	Bachi Burger	4
"Food: i had the porter house steak which by far one of the best ive ever had. 

Service: pretty much like any other steak house nothing stands out at this restaurant 

side notes: we went for new years eve celebrations thinking we could order their NYE special and regular menu like their ads stated. but apparently its by table only so everyone has to do the set menu. we decided not to do that."	3	35 Steaks + Martinis	4
Nice food and service! christian Santos, promptly greated us and was more then accommodating  that our drinks were served fast,. He's very polite and friendly!	5	Northside Café and Chinese Kitchen	3.5
Outstanding!  The selections and prices are the best you csn find.  The fruit \/juice stand offers varieties of slection which are hard to find anywhere else.  if yiu miss being in Mexico snd looking for an authentic market, youve found it!	5	La Bonita Supermercado	3.5
So many people recommended this place...  Why?   The food is average at best.  All small.portions are just that, small.  Reduces over indulgance but also dries out the food.  Roast beef was tough and not well cooked.  Seafood had minmal selections.  Not one item to brag about.  Over priced hyoe for a place that servers gimick mini containers to pretty uo child portions!  Not a fan.	2	Wicked Spoon	3.5
Our server Gilbert was fantastic! If I ever go back to the buffet I would ask for him each time; however, the quality of the food was very disappointing. I was so pumped to go here and left feeling irritated at the price I paid. The prime rib was gray and dry, the crab legs cold and over-cooked. The BBQ chicken had an overwhelming taste of liquid smoke, and the fish lacked seasoning. My salad was ok. My desserts were yummy. My bottomless drinks were always filled. Thank goodness they have some of the best customer service around because it helped my celebration dinner not be a total let-down.	3	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
Why is it that customer service is dead in the fast food industry yet they want $15 an hour for something you should get $7 paramedics get $15.  I go into this store and ask for a family meal and request 4 wings with my 10 piece leg and thigh meal.  The cashier can't punch in the order due to lack of training and the manager tells me he can only do 2 wings.  Now they are for my mom and she only likes wings so I push for 4 and end up with 3.  I thought it was a managers job to solve the problem not negotiate a less than desirable solution.  Didn't offer anything to make up for it not even a soda.	3	El Pollo Loco	2
"This hotel gets one star because i'm forced to put a star 

the hotel is whatever, you obviously know what you're getting yourself into by staying here. the room is decent, beware of the horribel stench the bathroom has. 
the housekeeping lady is absolutely a sweetheart -- so can't complain there. The wifi will not work, even though you call 5 times for them to come and fix it and they promise they will but it won't. i dont care for wifi but since i had my teenager sister with me who can't gamble, you can see why the wifi was important. 


but here it comes: 

the check in lady failed to tell me my card was going to get charged $238! 
i am so angry, i could drive the 300 miles to go and speak to a manager in person and tell them to hire better staff. 
So, i got my room through groupon, i made the mistake of not booking two nights, i get that. i was under the impression that i did book two nights so when i first checked in i asked if this was true, i was told IT WAS-- check in lady: ""you are booked for two rooms THROUGH groupon"" when i checked out, same situation: Check in lady:  ""you will only be charged the $39 hotel fee, but your 2 nights were charged through groupon"" i said-- "" are you sure, only $39 will get charged"" --- check in lady: ""yes of course here is your receipt"" 

so you can imagine my surprise when i went to check my account and i have a wopping $238 charge from them! 
just got off the phone with the manager and of course there is nothing they can do. 
if i knew i was going to pay that amount, i would have stayed at a much better hotel. i can't describe the anger i feel because i was told nothing but $39 would get charged on my card. i work in customer service so when employees doesn't advise me of what's going on, i am left speechless- because i do a great job at telling customers everything that is going on with THEIR BANK ACCOUNT! 
how dare you lie to my face and tell me one thing, this is my money. so, no i will never stay here again. 

advice for Riviera: 
hire better staff who is not going to lie to their customers to their face."	1	Riviera Hotel & Casino	2.5
I cannot believe its taken me this long to write a review, mainly because I'm insanely addicted to G.R. and his shows, but apparently not that addicted because I've only given this restaurant 4 stars. So, the run down... We were on a two week road trip and one of my stop choices was Las Vegas because I wanted to eat at Gordon Ramsay's Steak. I've always been so jealous watching Hells Kitchen seeing everyone get to try his food, so I had to put a stop to it! We didn't make reservations, well, we tried but apparently calling a day in advance didn't give enough lead time to not be booked, haha, I should've known. We did find out that there is a lounge area that is first come first serve, so we showed up there and prayed we'd get a seat and we did! We didn't have to wait very long either. Our waitress was awesome, attentive, and didn't mind joking back and forth with me about G.R. and agreeing to slipping him my number next time he's in town. I ordered 3 cocktails, all were good, but the best was the HK Antioxidant, it was really good. Ordered the Foie Gras and it was probably the best part of the entire meal. I ordered the Beef Wellington of course, I have been wanting to try it for forever and in part might be why I was slightly disappointed. It wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be, that in itself isn't that big of a deal, but the pastry wasn't cooked thoroughly, so it was kind of mushy and gross, I was looking forward to the flaky pastry along side the tender meat, but it kind of made me feel sick, still I feel like had it been cooked properly it would have been awesome and I'm not one to complain. My brother and his girlfriend chose the chicken and it wasn't until after the fact that they told me the chicken was really dry. They didn't want to ruin my night, but that upset me because we all know how Gordon feels about dry chicken! I would have said something, but I didn't know. They also got the asparagus soup and we enjoyed the presentation and they really enjoyed the flavor. Then we ordered dessert, this was back in September of last year (2012) so I'm not positive of the names, but it was the sticky toffee one, this was a risk because I'm not a fan of toffee- so let me just say, it was THAT good... Amazing! Our bill with tip came to around $250, which I think was worth it for the experience and would go back again if given the chance, I feel like it was probably just an off night. However I did not slip the waitress my number to give to Ramsay as I'm looking for a stellar chef... Maybe I should try going after Graham next :P.	4	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
I have to say this place is far more worse than other buffets, crab's legs are salty, bbq are not juicy at all. Oysters are in fresh. Not recommended	2	The Buffet	3.5
I love this place. Authentic Dim Sum, great service, clean, and Elaine always makes sure her regulars are taken care of . So ask for Elaine and tell her Nikki sent you!	5	Yum Cha	4

"I am extremely pleased with the quality and taste of the food and the very inviting, exceptional service! This place is very close to home and I'm so glad that I don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown to get some good pho. As a matter of fact, I think it actually tastes better than the dirty restaurants in Chinatown. This place is new, modern, and .... Clean !!!... and most importantly, the food is good! 

Came here with my husband and a friend. Two of us had the special pho (with everything in it), bun bo hue and a grilled pork sandwich. The sandwich was especially good and the two soups tasted great too. The broth was done perfectly. 

The owner even made me a special vinegar onion, but he made it with limes. How sweet of him to show such hospitality on my first visit! 

Definitely will be coming back and telling all my friends about this place to support them!"	5	Viet Bistro	3.5
"We were visiting Vegas from out of town for the weekend and Yelp reviews point us to Namaste! This place is great! The food, service and owner\/singer are absolutely fabulous! The owner and staff are happy to recommend items on the menu for those that aren't so familiar with Indian food. All recommendations were DELICIOUS! 

Every time we are in town, we will dine at Namaste!"	5	Namaste Indian Cuisine	4
I came here in a larger group for a birthday dinner and a positively amazing experience. We opted for a tasting course menu, where we able to taste several different plates. The staff was very attentive and the service was quick! My personal favorite item on the menu was the stuffed dates, delicious!! Everyone in my group loved our dinner experience and would recommend it to anyone! I hope to go back to Vegas soon and eat there again!	5	Julian Serrano Tapas	4
Excellent service and awesome food. A fine array of vegetarian and non-veg options. Their pita bread is to die for; we couldn't just have enough of it.	5	Paymon's Mediterranean Cafe & Lounge	4
Mediocre compared to other restaurants in hotel and pathetic compared to those in Vegas in general. Don't waste your time. So much more out there.	1	Alizé	4
"food is authentic, but giving 3 stars for the pushy service. the owner\/manager tried to sell hard liquor when we were not interested. Also, he was right next to us to get the check signed....seemed desperate to get a good tip. 

Tried their buffet as well, that was good & reasonable.

Would avoid this place as there are multiple other indian restaurants in Vegas."	3	Gandhi India's Cuisine	3.5
"the menu options are really exahustive including nepali cuisine.

our order of chettinaad vegetable curry and the nepali soup can be skipped by others. The chau chau vegetable noodles were tasty.

food quantity is less & more expensive than other indian restaurants in Vegas.

Ambience is excellent though!"	2	Mint Indian Bistro	4
owned by a nepali, but serves authentic indian food. The service was slow even though we were the only ones in the restaurant on a Fri night. The location is a bit far from the strip, but worth the trip.	4	Delhi Indian Cuisine	4
No stars are deserved here. The food was bland, cold and lacking variety. Half of the signs telling you what something was, were wrong or missing. The seafood upgrade at an additional $20 per person was a waste! 80% of the seafood in this "special" area was available in the regular buffet. Dessert variety was lacking as well. Seating was disorganized and no one seemed to know what they were doing. Both the Men's and Women's restrooms had no paper towels to dry your hands and no blowers to dry your hands either. Definitely a disappointment and waste of $118 for my wife and I.	1	Carnival World & Seafood Buffet	2.5
Came here with friends during a trip to Vegas. The food was good and really low priced. Only problem or complaint is that the waiter brought out the wrong drinks.	3	Ocean One Bar and Grille	3

Sushi was fresh. California roll had real blue crab in it not imitation. You get what you pay for. Pad Thai was delicious.  Nice quiet restaurant.	5	MOzen Bistro	4
Ate there yesterday for lunch with my 14 year old daughter: for Lasagne ($12), extra sauce ($3), Garlic Bread ($6), Caprese Salad ($9). The server was very excellent. My daughter insists I mention that the Olive Garden would have been better. The Lasagne tasted like sauce out of a can that had set out for days with low grade hamburger mixed in. The very thin layer of cheese on top was so thin it was nearly flavorless and what flavor was there was not a good one. The bread that came with the meal was less than average. The salad was bland. The garlic bread was a celebration of overpowering garlic assaulting my mouth. The funky cheese on that garlic bread polluted the flavor. The impression we left with was that this restaurant's management and kitchen staff are care far more about making money and cares very little about what they send out of their kitchen.	1	Sicilian Ristorante	4
"Best meal I have ever had in this contrived town chasing dollars all possible ways. The real Japanese Deal and the beat sake list I have seen outside of Japan. 
Soft shell crab, Japanese  squash, eggplants, roe and rice, real unprocessed Japanese tofu and more.
Wonderful experience and away from the Disney land environment if the strip."	5	Raku	4.5

Food was ok!"	1	Ocean One Bar and Grille	3
Brand could be a much better restaurant if the kitchen staff paid closer attention to what comes out to the diners' tables.  My gf ordered a Caesar Salad that cost $14.  It had a handful of Romain leaves, a small piece of Parmesan cheese, and two croutons.  Are you kidding me?  Who let that dull salad out of the kitchen?  My salad, the wedge was really quite good.  However, my medium-rare strip steak was a gristly unappetizing mess hardly worth being served at an all-night diner.  We spoke to the manager, John, who was very attentive to our concerns, and he not only listened, but also "did right by us."  So give the management some credit.  Might return, but that's iffy.	3	Brand Steakhouse	4

"Great time seeing my favorites GTA at Hakkasan and huge thank you to our Promoter, Jonathan! We were able to enjoy the night dancing away and enjoyed a few complimentary drinks. The 'wait' time was non-existent, since we were escorted in. 

This club's layout is a lot different than the clubs in Las Vegas. It has levels which is interesting. Overall I really like this place. The crowd was a bunch of convention nerds which was a great one. It tends to get a little packed on the dance floor but we did go on a busy weekend. 

What Stay's in Vegas Tip: Go through Jonathan!"	5	Hakkasan Nightclub	2.5
"My boy Guy Fieri failed me. It's okay, I still love you and you are my Internet icon. 

I was really excited to try this restaurant out as it was in our Hotel we were staying at, shout out to the Linq and always seeing videos of the Mac and Cheese burger. Our wait was a little longer than expected, our fault for going at the end of lunch rush but I was able to kill time at the blackjack table. 

When we were finally seated we were welcomed with a good ol' Taylor Swift blasting over the speakers. Haha Vegas, okay. The menu was pretty pricey but again... Haha Vegas, okay. I ended up going with my fat kid self and got the mac and cheese burger. OMFG that thing was so SALTY - it was saltier than me... Of course it being so salty I was super thirsty and our waitress never stopped by the table to refill our waters until after we got the bill, even tried to wave her down a few times. The food was okay, not the best and our service S-U-C-K-E-D.

Overall, make sure you're hydrated and definitely try the fries. Those were the highlight of the visit... 

ALSO, I love my girl Taylor Swift, but hearing her 4 times during our visit is much. LOL. 

Tasty Tip: Go to McDonalds, at least you'll get an emoji pillow in your happy meal."	2	Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar	3.5
Taco El Gordo on the strip are the BEST BY FAR. Omg have to go back again. If you want really good tacos authentic come here.	5	Tacos El Gordo	4
I though Moe's was real good for an airport with the airport prices. The burrito was big and had a good flavor. Also there was not a significant wait which I have had at other LAS restaurants. I think some of the other reviewers were having bad days.	4	Moe's Southwest Grill	2
Tried this place because we didn't want a huge meal but wanted to watch a game. There are so many TVs in the bar area and if you sit in the booths you get a personal TV to watch whatever game you want. The menu is small (mostly burgers and sandwiches) but the food we tried was tasty. They also have a decent beer selection. I was most impressed with the nachos and the onion rings. The nachos had chili, cheese, tomatoes, onions, sour cream, and jalapeños. If you're not into spicy food, I would recommend no jalapeños because they are spicy. We also had sliders which were delicious, three of them came with a side order of crinkle fries.	4	The Game	3.5
Really good food but the front service wasn't as expected. We were a group of 4 and made us wait until our group was complete to be seated but they gave a table to a group of 6 that was after us and was incomplete too.	4	Gordon Ramsay Burger	4
"Had the table side guacamole and it was amazing! Enrique was very knowledgeable of the menu items! Guys ask for Enrique.... He will take care of you!!! 

Thanks Enrique!!!"	4	El Dorado Cantina	4
My colleague read about this place in her hotel room suggestions and asked that we check it out. I wish I had checked Yelp before agreeing. I'm only giving 2 stars because the service was good. We had 2 servers that took care of us at all times. However, the food was very disappointing. It literally had no flavor. We started with an $8 plate of edamame that didn't even have salt on them. The worlds tiniest spring rolls came next, they were almost the size of a tootsie roll. I ordered the Spicy Laksa Lemak, a Malay dish that is supposed to be a spicy curry sauce over noodles and seafood. What I received was a bowl of noodles with coconut broth and seafood and fried tofu. It had no flavor at all. I put half the bowl of chilies from the table in it and still couldn't taste any flavor. My table mate said that her curry chicken noodles also had no flavor. The one person that was happy with their meal had the honey walnut prawns, with were like little funnel cakes. Meals in Vegas are too expensive to be this disappointing. I have another week here, hopefully the Palazzo won't continue to disappoint.	2	Hong Kong Cafe	2.5
"This is the real deal. There's nothing like it, unless of course you go to Chicago. 

I was beyond thrilled that this place opened up in Vegas. The dough is crisp and soft in all the right places. There is a ton of cheese, but it's not overpowering. There's something about the proportions of this deep dish which make it delicious. Please come hungry. I had to divide one slice into several meals. Maybe because I had a salad while we waited. This pizza is only for the serious. 

If you eat at the upstairs portion of the restaurant, you get pretty nice view of the strip. The space is really cool.

Oh and as others have mentioned, it takes 45 min to 1hour to prep the pizza."	5	Giordanos - Las Vegas	4
Horrible promoters. All lies and scams. They honestly ruined my entire Vegas experience. Don't ever fall for them. 0 stars to be honest. If you're that desperate to get into this basic club just pay and skip the line.	1	Hakkasan Nightclub	2.5
Solid! Really friendly service, delicious food. A fancy-ish place, but had a cool casual feel and didn't feel stuffy at all. We were a big group of about 10, and they had no issues accommodating us or our schedules (since we had a show to catch after dinner.)	5	DB Brasserie	3.5
"Solid.
Even though we were staying IN the Bellagio, we still totally got lost and showed up late for our reservation (past the grace period).  They still seated us without too much fuss.
Unless you are vegetarian or have some other legit reason, you MUST get the beef carpaccio.  It is to die for, and was a great size to split for 4 people.  I also had the lamb lollipop entree, and it was great. On the pricey side, but hey it's Vegas, and the food does not disappoint."	4	Olives	4
My friend and I went to Hot and Juicy for lunch yesterday and shared a bag of shrimp, an order of sweet potato fries, and an order of corn fritters. Plenty of delicious food to share! The only thing I felt that could have helped the meal was a great sauce for the sweet potato fries- they were served with ketchup, which was ok, but could have been better. The corn fritters were delicious, the shrimp- "over the top" and the service was perfect!!!! Aubree was our server and she was so attentive and friendly! We can't wait to come back and hope to get served by Aubree again!	5	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
We took our family to this restaurant and it was delicious. We had a lot of fun and the service was really good. The all-you-can-eat sushi was fantastic.	5	Sushi Way	4.5
I came here very exited to try the food after work.  I walked in and I was pointed to a table to sit at my w young nice guy.  I sat where I thought I was asked to sit.  Once I sat down I was rudely moved to another table by an older guy.  The guy said "the guy asked you to sit at that other table", but said it with such a quick and nasty attitude.  I said sorry and moved to the other table.  At that point I really felt embarrassed and upset and felt like leaving.  I decided to stay anyways and try the food.  I ordered the bulgogi fries.  They were not what I expected.  The fries were soo soggy and the meat mushy.  I got the 1\/2 order and I'm glad I did not order the full size because after eating 1\/4 of this I started to feel nauseous.  I had ordered an order of the bulgogi rice to go.  My husband tried this and didn't like it.  He said it left a weird after taste and feeling in his tongue.  I hadn't even told him about the fries.  I will never go here again.  I don't know what everyone goes so crazy about and why the reviews are soo high for this place.  Nasty nasty and terrible service!!!!!	1	KoMex Fusion	4.5
I came here for my 1 hour lunch break.  I ordered the pork torta ahogada.  I was not too impressed with this since I though the carnitas were going to be pulled pork and not cubed pieces of pork.  The pork did not have a lot of flavor, and I kept finding a lot of fat pieces in the sandchich.  The sauce that is used to soak the sandwhich had a bit too much oregano and was too spicy( and I love spicy food). They need to keep in mind that not everyone can handle that kind of heat.  I also ordered 1 taco, and this taco was good(but not enough to be on my fav taco place list).  I had gotten a pastor taco.  The taco was not that bad.  I am willing to give this place another shot layer on.	3	Las Tapatias	3.5
Ordered the meatball sandwhich and this was delish!  I also ordered a slice of cheese pizza.  This pizza was also good.  The establishment is clean.  I went for lunch break and the establishment was packed but yet I got my food pretty quickly.  I will be back for more!	4	Cugino's Italian Deli & Pizza	4.5
"Sadly i have to update my review on these tacos 
They used to be for me, the best tacos around in Las Vegas.  But now the person who makes them is someone new and the tacos are no longer good .
I ordered some tripe tacos and they were undercooked and super soggy.  The tongue tacos were hard.  Which means the tongue was undercooked.  It's very sad that they went from being the best to being the worst.  I left them with 2 stars because their other food is ok.


I have only had tacos from here.  This is a restaurant but at night they also sell tacos outside.  I don't know if they do this during the week or only the weekends.  I have always gone on weekends.  This is one of my favorite taco spots in Las Vegas along with Las Taquizas on Lamb and Bonanza. My husband also loves these and he is soo picky with his food.  The meats have soo much flavor and are tender.  They have a condiment section and you can add any of the selections on your tacos.  They have a green salsa that is very good but super spicy.  The first time I had it my nose was soo runny lol.  I hope you guys give this place a try!"	2	La Tradicion	3.5
The food here is  great.  Has good flavor and reminds me of my grandmas cooking.  Customer service was also good, the lady at the counter was friendly and patient while we looked at the menu and decided what we wanted.  I ordered the gordita and taco combo and everything tasted great.  My husband ordered the enchilada and taco combo.  He said this was very good.  I also ordered a champurrado and I must say that it was the best I had ever had.  The taco was good, but I have had better.  If I'm looking to only have tacos, I already have another place for that.  Since the food was so good here I know I will be returning to try other dishes.  The only thing I did not like was the way the food was served on styrofoam containers cut in half.  It just looked a little ghetto to me, and that's why they got 4 stars from me.  Also, for all the food we got and drinks, our total was $16! You can't beat that, every time I go out to dinner with my husband our total tends to be around $22.00	4	Arandas Taqueria	4
Just came here a few days ago.  I was expecting a lot better.  I wish the rating score would also do 1\/2 points because if it did this review would be a 3.5.  I ordered 2 tacos de adobada (spicy pork), 1 tongue, and 1 tripe.  I ordered my tacos with everything which is cilantro, onion and salsa.  The adobada tacos were good.  I was not a huge fan of the tortillas.  They somewhat have a flavor that regular tacos do not have, not even tacos in Mexico.  The tongue taco was ok.  The tongue was just not too flavorful (probably not seasoned enough with salt).  The tripe taco made me disappointed.  The tortilla to this taco was warm because they had just warmed it up but the tripe was kind of cold :( which was sad because these are my favorite tacos.  The color of the lard was white with clearly shows also that the tripe was cold.  My tacos came with grilled onions and peppers.  These were good. Up to now, the best tacos in Las Vegas are still the ones on Lamb and Bonanza.  Las Taquizas.  I am trying different tacos in Vegas to see if I find any better but so far those are the best.  If I am ever in the area, and really wanted tacos, I would give this place another chance.	3	Taco Tijuana	4
Absolutely Love this place.  My coworker and I come here once a week for lunch.  We order ahead because it does take some time for the staff to make our food, but it is still soo worth it!!!  I also come here with my husband often.  I have been going here pretty much since they opened.  I love the chicken pesto panini, and the vegetarian panini.  Their juices are great.	5	Cherry Berries	4
I finally got to try their famous crêpes after seeing them on Facebook for so long.  I am happy that now they have their establishment.  I had their cheesecake crêpe and it was delicious.  I went in with a large party and took up most of the place.  They were very nice and attentive to all of us.  Great customer service, great food.  Will be back soon to try their savory crêpes and their paninis.	5	Crêpe Station	4
These are the best tacos I have had here in Las Vegas!!!!  I have been going here for the past 2 years or so.  When ever we have family here from out of town we have to bring them here to eat.  My husband and I come here to eat even when it's super hot, and super cold outside.  During the summer months I enjoy my tacos with horchata water, which is a sweet rice drink, and during the winter I always order champurrado.  My husband always orders the tacos al pastor, and I always order tacos de tripa(tripe tacos), taco de lengua(tongue), and I order these with cheese.  You can see the ladies making the tortillas right in front of you( if you are tall enough lol).  They have a salsa bar with all the toppings.  If you try this place out please try their purple onions which they soak in lime juice.  Also, prepare to eat standing.  To me, the food is worth standing while you eat. They also have quesadillas, burritos, and tortas but I have never had these.	5	Las Taquizas	4.5
"I have been here three times and the food here is awesome!  I didn't even know about this restaurant until my mom asked us to go with her.  The first time I went I ordered camarones al mojo de ajo (garlic shrimp) which was delish.  During yesterday's visit I ordered 1 chile relleno burrito, 1 tongue taco, 1 adobada taco.  I asked for rice to be added to the burrito, and this was done :). The burrito was great with a lot of cheese.  The tacos had so much flavor.  The day before I tried the tacos from Taco Tijuana but the tacos at
El cordobes are better that Taco Tijuana.  
Taco Ranking so far FYI
#1 spot- Las Taquizas on Lamb and Bonanza. 
#2 spot- El Cordobes
#3 spot- Taco Tijuana
You can read my reviews for all.  
El cordobes has very good prices for their food.  Everything I had was 1 burrito, 2 tacos and 1 soda all for $10.50.  When I walk into this place it feels as if I were walking into my grandmas home to eat her food.  The only problem here is that they do not have flavored water like horchata, tamarindo and Jamaica.  All they have are sodas and beers, but the food is soo good that it makes up for this.  Please make sure you get the refried beans with your food!!  Also, I think it's cash only.  I payed cash but I think I saw a sign that said no debit\/credit."	5	El Cordobes	4.5
Soo gross! I walked in here with my husband for tacos.  I ordered 2 of pastor, 2 lengua and 1 buche.  We ordered 2 drinks: 1 horchata and 1 tamarindo(these drinks are not from scratch but made from pre made powder).  The tacos were soo bad.  The tortilla was a little cold, and quickly got soggy.  The meat on the tacos was not hot at all.  It was kind of room temp.  The only taco that had warm meat was the buche taco but this taco was dripping in fat.  That's what made my tacos soggy.  Please don't come here to eat!!!  I went to the salsa bar to get some radishes to eat with the tacos but I was grossed out when I saw that some of these were brownish.  The establishment was very dirty, and is in need of remodeling.  I don't understand how this place has gotten the good reviews that it has.  Look at pics to see how dirty this place was.	1	Tacos Mexico	3
"This is my 2nd time here.  Both times I had tacos and they are the best I've had in Las Vegas.  I love the style of the tacos and Jaime really hooks you up!
The tacos are big, and they have the perfect amount of meat.  
I order the tongue tacos and pastor and they were really good.  Besides the great food Jaime has the best costumer service.  Both times I have been there we talk like we have known each other for a while.  He is from Veracruz and doesn't like the hot weather here in Vegas ;).
Go and enjoy the food, and get to know this awesome man :)"	5	Taco San Francisco	5
We are from out-of-state. Their service was absolutely great. The pricing was good. They told us where we can go fish and enjoy our kayaking experience.	5	Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar	4
"This is my first visit to Rivas.  The food here is very tasty and fresh.  I walked in here and ordered 2 tacos.  1 steak and 1 shrimp.  I didn't order anything else because I was worried that I wouldn't like the food but I was wrong!   I am mildly allergic to shrimp, but I love shrimp and had to order one lol.  The rash on my face will go away in 1 day so no worries.  I'm glad I went against my health because the shrimp tacos are delish and have great seasoning.  If you try the shrimp on its own it is a bit salty but in the taco, it really makes the flavor stand out and the salt is evened out by the other toppings.  The tacos come with pico de gallo and guacamole.  I am not a fan of pico de gallo since I don't like raw tomatoes.  I asked the cashier if I could get onion and cilantro instead of pico de gallo which are considered ""extra toppings""(75 cents each) and she said yes :) . When I got my tacos, they had no cilantro and they said they had ran out :( My tacos were still good.  The steak taco was very good as well.  The steak was tender, juicy and seasoned perfectly.  They have a salsa bar and the green salsa is good and spicy( I love spicy food) so beware if you can't handle the heat.  Salsa heat scale 7\/10.  For the tacos they use the regular corn tortillas instead of the small taco tortillas.  The tacos are big.  The tortillas are soft so my tacos broke when I was eating the taco (hate it when this happens).  My grandma was always very very picky with the way tortillas are warmed up, and she would not have been happy with Rivas.  Since they were not warmed long enough they broke easily.  The guacamole here is very good and thick which I love.  After I ate my 2 tacos I got up to order one more shrimp taco!  This place is 2 minutes away from my house so if I am really craving these tacos I would stop my here for them.
 But for the best Mexican tacos I would go somewhere else.  So far these are my rankings for best tacos(in my opinion) in Vegas.  Keep in mind that I am looking for authentic tasting\/looking tacos.  
#1- Las Taquizas (Lamb\/Bonanza) taco truck
#2-El Cordobes (Tropicana\/Nellis)
#3- Rivas Mexican Grill
#4-Taco Tijuana (Forgot the streets\/google it)
You can see my reviews for all these.  Thank you, 
Taco Lady"	4	Rivas Mexican Grill	4.5
Their food is very good.  They have a great variety of food options.  My husband loves the sushi, I love the potstickers(which not a lot of Chinese food buffets have).  I have always agreed with the rest of my family that the food is very flavorful.  What you pay here is more than at other Chinese food buffets in Las Vegas but it is clearly because of the food, and to me the food is worth the price.  The only reason why I give this place a 4 star rating is due to the customer service.  In all the times I have been here I have never had a staff member smile at me.  They do make people feel like a number.	4	Buffet At Asia	2.5
The family and I came here today.  I ordered the guacamole boyger with the chencho skinny fries.  My brother ordered the the pastrami boyger and also the same fries.  We asked for the burgers to be cut in half because we wanted to share and I'm glad we did.  Both boygers were awesome!  Fries were great! Will be back for sure.  We were a party of 8 and they accommodated all of us in there perfectly.  Great customer service.	5	Fat Boy	4.5
The food is good but not the best food there is.  I had ordered for delivery.  I was told it would be about 30 min.  An hour after I had ordered my food I decided to call to find out what was going on since it was taking longer than told.  The guy that answered the phone said that they had gotten busy...  Ok, they did have my cell phone number so they could have called me!!!  About 20 min later the food came. Once the food was being delivered, the delivery guy kept calling me to ask where I lived because he couldn't find my home.   I had to go outside to basically wave him over.  Sorry,  I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(	2	Los Huicholes	4
The sandwich I ordered was sooo delicious and people working here are really kind. I especially really like the idea of selecting what we want on the paper bag, since I am an anxious person when it's about ordering food, haha. I definitively never go to subway again. I found my new favorite sandwich place !	5	Which Wich Superior Sandwiches	3.5
"I was craving curry and my boyfriend & I was searching for a good place to eat some. Sadly there's not a lot of place that sell good curry in Vegas but with some research we found this place and I convinced my boyfriend to go try it even if it's quite far away from our home. It was a really good decision ! The owner gave us a warm welcome and was really friendly and talkative with us. The curry is amazing ! The gravy is thick and give this warm feeling that curry should have. And I like how we can add the topping of our choice (I was really glad they have cheese as topping option, as a cheese lover, haha.) 

So if you live in Vegas and want good curry, Oh! Curry is the place you need."	5	Oh Curry	4.5
"Very disappointed. The order was wrong. We asked for white sauce on the pizza since my boyfriend and I have hard time to digest tomato sauce and we actually got tomato sauce instead of the white one. Also, the cheese is almost absent and tastes absolutely nothing. The crust remind me a piece of cardboard box. Really not worth the price and the delivery fees. So I suggest you to avoid the pizza from here.

UPDATE 10\/31\/2015: The chicken wings are as bad as the pizza, no flavor. My boyfriend asked for mild spicy and he got plain wings. Apparently this place was good a few years ago, we wonder what's happened. Very disappointing, we won't let them a chance anymore."	1	Sorrento Pizza	3
"I was staying at The Hotel and came to The Cafe for brunch before checkout.

Food (5\/5)
I enjoyed the Vegetable Panini here. It was a good size and came with a mound of lightly-seasoned garlic fries for $16.

Service (4\/5)
The staff was friendly and our waiter was helpful in describing the dishes I was considering. The service was quick. My only negative comment is that one staff member came to ask if I was finished as he reached for my plate (I had finished the panini but hadn't touched the fries) and I said no but he still grabbed my plate and I had to say ""no"" again.

Ambiance (3\/5)
Relaxed setting with a view of people walking by with luggage or tall drinks."	4	THEcafe at THEhotel	3.5
I had to call the restaurant from inside of it in order for somebody to come to the counter to take my order. Girl was short and unwelcoming to me. Sad because the pizza here is always very good. Too bad it's not good enough to make up for terrible service.	1	Naked City Pizza On Paradise	3.5
Best Burger on the strip. Our server Mallory was amazing. Super energetic and told us about all the options and specials for beers and cocktails.	5	Fat Bar	4
Great place for a drink, especially on a cold night! Cozy bar area, but has a decent dining area as well. Love it here!	5	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
The all-you-can-eat sushi was very good. Their service was very friendly and nice. For a Japanese sushi restaurant the desserts were delicious as well.	4	Sakana	4
"Well I agree with quite a bit of the other responses, definitely not worth the money.  The meal was $29.99 plus tax for the seafood buffet.  The only reason it even deserves one star is because the crab legs were tasty and already cut in half making it easy to eat.  Other than that the food was very bland; mussels were not very good, shrimp ceviche was sub-par, NY strip had no flavor, prime rib was cooked to medium well (way too done for prime rib), sushi rolls were not even worth eating, even the grilled vegetable tasted like they had no salt or pepper use.  The only other thing worth mentioning was the grilled sausage, it was rather tasty.

The service was horrible.  I waited 15 minutes before one of the people seating came over to me and said ""I see you have not been served a drink yet.""  Then when I emptied it, the waitress walked by the table and grabbed my dirty dishes and never returned to fill the drink.  I ate the plate of food that I just got (crab legs) and then had to go to the back and ask a ""bus"" lady for a drink.

Never again!"	1	MGM Grand Buffet	2.5
I had breakfast here. The burrito was big and good (could have used a little more meat filler). I also had a churro which was excellent. As you can expect it is airport pricing.	4	Baja Fresh	2.5
"I went to this restaurant after seeing some really nice reviews here at yelp.

 We ordered chicken manchow soup, chicken lollypop and veg noodles.

It was very disappointing. Hope they improve in future."	1	JaiHo Restaurant	3
"This was the second night of our culinary vacation in Las Vegas and the food did not disappoint!  The service was not quite as perfect as it could has been but I think the waiter had his plate full.
We started simply, ordering the foie gras, when the amous boush was sent out by the chef.  It was a potage with tumeric, chives and crispy ham to top.  And while bread and butter may seem simple, this was not the case at Andre's.  Our butter selection was a trio selection of sun-dried tomato, kalamata olive and simple sea salt.  The kalamata olive was out favorite, the flavor was creamy and salty with a hint of grape.  (I know what you are thinking, how can that be?  The magic of Andres.)
Our foie gras was the most amazing that we have ever had.  It was like Christmas IN your mouth.  A generous portion of pan seared foie atop a perfectly poached apple floating in a 5 spice creme anglaise with a port wine reduction that was to die for. (Or stab your partner's hand with the fork so I could eat it all.) Did I mention the skinless grape that was sliced so thin that, if portioned properly you has a slice of green grape with each bite of foie, apple and creme?
After this delight, we were brought our Summer Truffle Risotto.  Market Price.  Turns out for the amount of truffle that was shaved onto our mint risotto with duck comfit it was really inexpensive.  Creamy, balanced, earthy, (just enough) cheesy and so delicious.  I am very happy this was my first experience with black truffle.
The chef then sent out an intermezzo of grapefruit sorbet floating in a bit of soda water to cleanse our palates.
I had the free range chicken, which was cooked perfectly, juicy and tender
on a bed of corn and chile ragout.  It would seem to be a bit on the spicy side for someone unaccustomed to heat, though it was perfect for me.  The mole was delightful and full of flavor."	4	Andre's	4.5
Great selection of food. All you can eat has a great selection of delicious rolls and other type of dishes you can order from. Courteous  servers it was a great place to eat sushi	5	Umiya Sushi	4
This place is HORRENDOUS. I booked a courtyard room and was given a gorgeous view of the parking lot and some bum walking next to my window. The remote control did not work. The volume on the 100 hundred year old tv was the only thing that worked. I complained about the room and cancelling my stay and Julio was very helpful. Julio and the bell man did not look surprised about our complaints. I would rather sleep in the car under a bridge than ever stay here again. You could not pay me to stay here. This place is disgusting	1	Palace Station Hotel & Casino	2.5
"I've been meaning to get here for a while when down in Vegas. Should have come sooner! Had the Tamago Burger and Jazz Fries. The burger was really good, but those fries with excellent gravy and their 'crack sauce' (Japanese mayo and a hint of spicy rooster perhaps) are worth the trip alone. 

I showed up on a chilly 10:45pm evening as their only two customers were leaving. They could have easily said they were shutting down, but didn't. The host\/server was super congenial and made me feel welcome; like he was grateful to have another customer for the evening, rather than annoyed he had to stay open. Even had the chef come out to say hi! 
Go to Fukuburger, you won't be disappointed.

New location coming on Spring Mountain and Jones-ish? Soft open maybe next week."	5	Fuku Burger	4
"Love margaritaville... Until now. For overpriced food and drinks you come for the scenery. They closed the top floor ""because management said so"". Cool, so they sat us with a view of the strip... Cool, what that meant is a view of the walk next to the strip.  Whatever the nachos are great so it's worth it right? 25 minutes later no one looked at us so we're out. Manager said someone went home so they got confused... Usually don't write reviews for bad service but they sat us well after they knew the server
Left. Done with them."	1	Margaritaville	3.5
"Came here on a Friday night, had heard from a coworker that it was good. I had the Rahm Schnitzel,  sauce had decent flavor; however the spaetzel was very dry and over cooked. Portions kinda small, and no salad, pretzels or bread included with dinner. My husband had the Worstplatte, which is a selection of their sausages. Over cooked as well. Mashed potatoes were runny and not enough of them. Sauerkraut was very tasty. Price per dinner for what you get is not worth it.  (Oh and the cost of their first Saturday dinner buffet has gone up to $22.99 supposedly includes beverage and dessert.)

Overall disapointing. I can make better at home."	3	Café Berlin	4.5
"My impression is that I am not nearly hipster or yuppy-vapid enough to truly appreciate this place, I guess. My husband really wanted to go here so I humored him and we did just that, luckily it was after 9pm on a Thursday so parking was easy enough to find and we didn't have to pay, but any other time I can see the HUGE draw back. 

There were the drunk pretentious Vegas\/LA type people who are only their to drink and be seen. Most of the shops were closed, except for the food and beverage scene. Not impressed at all. Pricing like that of The Strip, which I guess means it is normally overrun with tourons. If I want that experience i'll go a few blocks over to Fremont or down to The Strip. 

NOT going back if I can help it."	2	Downtown Container Park	4
"So after much haraunging by my husband we were able to swing by the container park near Fremont street. It was after 9pm when all the under 18 crowd is kicked out so a peaceful uncrowded stroll through something akin to The Pearl District\/Pioneer Square in Portland, OR. Piped in music and almost no crowd now, where to get some late night munchies after gambling for the last few hours at a local casino? Pork & Beans... ok I'm game name sounds cool, smelled delicious, and... well yeah. 

I got the Classic which is Pork and Beans with a garnish of a random piece of over cooked bacon (ie burnt) and parsley. The beans were blah, really gritty texture and had to ask for some of the stone ground mustard to put on it to give it some sort of flavor. They were also not very hot temperature wise. 

Now I want to make note that as someone who is a classically trained chef and whose mom was from the south I can appreciate a yummy rendition of southern food. This was not it, disappointed to say the least.

My husband got the Ultimate Hot Dog, it comes topped with the stone ground mustard, carmelized onions, and chopped pickle relish on a hoagie roll that was toasted on a flattop. He enjoyed his food thoroughly. (He is a chef too, just fyi)

We decided to try the rockyroad brownie as it looked tasty when served to some other patrons. Cold. Yes it was cold... and the parchment paper was still stuck to the bottom. Ugh, the flavor was awesome, chewy chocolatey goodness with toasted marshmellows and chunks of chocolate oh and lets not forget the crunchy walnuts mixed in too! Would have been way better warmed up with a dollop of whipped cream or the option of a scoop of vanilla icecream, just a thought. I guess if you are looking to serve people here in the dead heat of summer cold would be better, shrugs.

Service was prompt, probably because the place was almost empty, and and the people there were nice. All seemed appreciative we were there, even the security guard checking our ids as we went in. 

Best part of the whole evening was the giant praying mantis out front whose antennae spit out 5 foot flames. If nothing else go check that out after dark!"	2	Pork & Beans	3
Nice place to hang out with friends and have few drinks. The golfing experience here is comparable with bowling.	4	Topgolf	4
"My hubby and I as trained chefs and coming from the NW  always are on the look out for tasty food that has fresh ingredients and offers them at a decent price. This cafe does just that. Think Mediterranean menu meats fresh organic deli type food. 

I had the turkey sandwich which was delcious, with the seasonal seared tuna on mixed geens with a ginger seasame dressing and edamame. The sandwich was done panini style and was an addicting blend of textures and flavors all completely in sync. The salad had such a delcious dressing with just a hint of pepper heat to balance out the sweet. My hubby had the Pide (greek style flat bread?) BBQ chicken flavor and it was very good too, he ended up dipping the crust into the dressing remains of my salad. 

Only reason not five stars was we were served on paper plates and a plastic trays while other customers were served on actual plates with real silverware. The salad dressing made the paper plate soggy and made a bit of a mess. Although the plates and plastic wear were compostable, which I do appreciate."	4	Presto Cafe	4.5
Food great, service good, two stars for the super loud music that they refused to turn down. Would have been nice to carry on a conversation with out having to yell. Just fyi management, makes it difficult to enjoy a meal when it's not conducive to visit. Which is one of the reasons we as humans go out for food, its a bonding experience,  but not here. More of an eat and get out. Even in the middle of the afternoon when there were maybe 15 diners total.	2	Hash House A Go Go	4
After enjoying the rides in Adventure Dome in Circus Circus with my wife and 4 yo son, we decided to eat at Mexitalia since it's in front of the dome. I didn't mind the cafeteria type service, which means we wait in line to order and then when our number is called we pick up our order. I ordered fish tacos, my wife- beef tacos and my son mac and cheese. When I got our food, it was cold! Mind you we were the 2nd people in line! The fish was not fresh, it reminded of frozen fish tater tots! My wife's beef was tough! The kicker was even my 4 yo old son spit his mac and cheese out! He said it was yucky!!! How can anyone mess up mac and cheese! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE	1	Mexitalia X-Press	2
"Bought a 6"" Turkey with avocado a couple nights ago and was very disappointed. The meat was plentiful; they threw in 5 slices, which was awesome. However, the entire sandwich was ruined when it came to the avocado. The avocado was past it's due date. It was evidenced by the fact that it was brown and tasted bad. It might have been a one time thing, or maybe the guy didn't notice.

I would give them a second chance, just to see if maybe it improves."	2	Subway	2.5
"What the heck are all of you complaining about? this Is a great deal and the owner is always very friendly! The pizza is very good and always heavy on the toppings. I live right here in providence and an happy not to have to get a crappy pizza from Domino's all the way down on Durango. That place sux!! So what if the Kids were drinking soda and what not, their like 16 years old and do a pretty dang good job if you ask me. I had to sign up just to stick up for this new business in our neighborhood. Not too happy about the smoke shop, but what can you do.

Oh Yea It's $7.00 pizza people relax!"	5	MrJims.Pizza of Las Vegas	3.5
"Gross! Tastes like microwaved mush.

 Everything cold and covered in gelatinous ""sauce"". Orange chicken not at all crispy....had the texture of a sponge and cold. Mongolian beef swimming in brown liquid and overpowered by green peppers....cold. Spring rolls also cold and mushy. Chicken fried rice had no vegetables in it.
Just awful.... $45 wasted. The only thing edible was the plain white rice and it was also cold.
2 stars for prompt delivery but this was disgusting and I will never order from here again."	2	Gourmet Wok	3.5

One of the good Indian cuisine restaurants in Vegas. Their buffet is my favorite!	4	Delhi Indian Cuisine	4
I'm in town for the night for a conference tomorrow. Found it on Yelp due to high ratings and within a mile of my hotel.  Then saw the feature by Guy Fieri on Food Network and knew I had to check it out. Tried pork belly bao duck bao and the pot stickers. Both versions of the bao were really good but the pork belly dish was out of this world.  Already wondering if I can sneak off at lunchtime for another visit before heading home.	5	Fat Choy	4
I've been at this establishment several times and the host staff always greets us promptly and is very courteous. Wait staff varies on attentiveness; however, the food is great! You get a salad or soup with your meal. Prior to your meal they serve you hot ciabatta rolls with whipped butter. The caesar salad dressing is made perfect- with just the right anchovies. The prime rib is always tasty- perfectly cooked and seasoned well. They offer pure horseradish and less spicy horseradish sauce. On the side, you have a choice of potato or vegetables. The price of the meal between 3 of us was under $60 without tip. It's a great value. Keep in mind i've had prime rib at Lawry's and Prime Rib Loft is better.	4	Prime Rib Loft	3.5
"I would say this is more like 2.5 stars and don't waste your money if you are looking for delicous meat dishes. 
Tried multiple items:
Lobster bisque- good
Fried Chicken tasty
Prime Rib- all over cooked (horrible gray)to the point there was no flavor
Quail- same as the prime rib little to no flavor and overcooked
Duck-overcooked
Needless to say I tried multiple meat dishes and had them discarded because the dishes were bland and overcooked. 
When we notified the staff, the wait staff was very cordial and sent over a manager. The experience with the manager was probably the least ingenuine display of empathy in her eyes even though the words coming out of her mouth made it sound like she cared. Either way you get a sense that your feedback is going in one ear out the other.
Overall this buffet does not really have anything that really sets it apart from say the Caesar or M resort buffet other than the beautiful ambience.
Caesar definitely has a better selection of meat dishes and they are more flavorful and not overcooked."	2	The Buffet	3.5
"Went here for New years and ambience was perfectly laid back with the right kind of lighting. Seats were comfortable. Ordered the gyoza to start and perfectly tender in the middle with a crispy fried outside. Spicy tuna roll was well prepared and unlike some other places it didn't fall apart when picking up with chopsticks.  Pork belly was a tad overcooked but delicious
Service was excellent!"	4	Pier 215	4.5
Beats any other donut place I have tried so far  in my lifetime. Seriously after eating one I can't help eating a second and wanting a third. Glazed donuts are the true test.  Ronalds glazed isn't too sweet, the dough has that brilliant tang and is perfect. If you want some delicious custard in your mouth go for the Boston creme or ask for just a glazed plain filled. Absolutely mouth watering just thinking about them.	5	Ronald's Donuts	4.5
"Walked into this place and 3 people standing behind counter with one at register. One behind register didn't acknowledge me and walked away .  One person finally asked if I had been helped and proceeded to take my order. My order was prepared but he walked away without taking payment and said another individual would take payment. Was given my sandwich and I had to tell them I still haven't paid. He kept yelling to a female. She finally came up front to take payment. When I commented on there disorganization there was no apology.
After I ate the sandwich I was still hungry so I went back in for the same order -apple smoked bacon, pepper jack, 1 egg and cream cheese on an onion bagel.
I went to the same register I went to the first time. I kept looking at the employees and nobody acknowledged. Other customers walked in the door. The light bulb finally went on as I had not seen the sign before where I was originally standing under said pay here. It should have been a ""duh"" moment but in all my experience this setup is backwards from most other stores which they have the ordering counter up front after you walk in the door. Well being this is my first time in this store imagine my surprise. Regardless of my ignorance about the backwards setup, an employee should have acknowledged and pointed that out to me. So I stood in  the proper line to order and the man behind the counter was pleasant and took my order and then of course I went to the pay here register.
Overall the experience was poor. It cost me $5.40 for the first sandwich and $6.90 for the second. Why the price difference for the same sandwich?  Well the first time I asked for cream cheese after they took my order so I was given a side. Little did I realize they charge$1.50 for cream cheese. What a ripoff. 
So in total I paid  $12.30 for breakfast. The next person who says fast food is cheap should think again."	2	Einstein Bros	2.5
"Looking at the previous reviews and the wait to get in I really thought I was in for an amazing experience. However, the experience was truly disappointing.
I was sitting at Extra Lounge enjoying cocktails and live music and thought I would order a burger to go since I was literally next door. The hostess kindly took my order and I paid for it and was told they would text me when it was ready. I waited about 20 minutes and then finally received my message. It took one minute for me to see the text and go back to the restaurant. When I picked it up the boxes were bagged to go, no utensils or napkins. I then requested the items and the hosted grabbed them. It took me less than a minute to get back to my seating. When my friend and I opened our to go boxes, both burgers (the farm and uber) looked like they had been sitting out and they looked like pre-frozen shaped patties. He had his protein style and mine was medium rare with the bun.  I took a couple of bites and was expecting some incredible flavor bursts but was let down. Both burgers  were bland with no seasoning and I realized then they left off the bacon I requested. I proceeded to take my burger back and reported to the hostess that the burger was cold and the bacon was missing. The manager came over and promptly apologized and removed the cost from my bill. Giving me a deer and head lights look she tried to convince me to try dining with them again. It was the least genuine attempt I've seen.

I worked in the restaurant industry long enough that I can tell when food has been sitting.
This burger, although ordered as medium rare, should have been warm on the outside.
There wasn't any hint that it was even cooked on an open flame and I couldn't even distinguish the cheeses. Mind you I eat rib eye steak or ground beef (raw, rare, or medium rare) almost every day and I can smell and distinguish flavors very easily.    Overall, this is overhyped and doesn't deliver. Don't waste your money."	1	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
"Lovely ambience and lighting,  perfect place for catching up with friends.
Ordered the grilled octopus starter which was flavorful but overcooked. The manager attended to us quickly and removed the item from our bill and apologized. 
For the main meal I ordered the scallops and asked for a low carb alteration which included brussel sprouts instead of the cauliflower. The entire dish was delicious and perfectly cooked. 
Would definitely go back."	4	Honey Salt	4
"If you want a hip and up beat place for delicous breakfast, this is the place to go. I had the standard waffles with eggs and bacon. A good test for me is if I can eat the waffles without syrup and really enjoy the flavor of the waffle. This place definitely passes the test. 
My friend had the chicken waffles and the fried chicken was outstanding.  Overall great breading and juicy chicken. 
Service was excellent and the have fresh squeezed orange juice."	4	Hash House A Go Go	4
"On the plus side the dishes are very flavorful and the staff is pleasant. They have a mint duck that is not on the menu that is delicious.  Staff is friendly and the interior of the restaurant is delightful and comfortable. 
On the down side the amount of meat placed in the dishes is stingy to the point my friends and I went to 168 for a whole duck and picked dishes from here as sides. For example the tom yung koong they put 8 shrimp which sounds like a lot but really isn't and if you want more they charge $1.50 per shrimp. They won't even add extra duck to any of the duck orders. The pork fried rice had less than 1 ounce of pork in it. At that rate what's the point of calling it pork or chicken or whatever meat you get in the dish because there is barely any meat. 

That's why this deserves 3 stars instead of 4. If you are a meat eater don't expect to get much from this place; however if you are fine with that then expect a flavorful experience."	3	Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant	4
"I always plan on having breakfast here while I'm in vegas. Great prices, Great food and Great Service. 

Carole Ann served us today and she was great. 

Worth the wait. If you have a group, Call ahead and let them know. They will try and get something set up for you before you get there."	5	Egg & I	4.5

"***It's a really long review, I hope it doesn't deter you from reading it***


I really wish yelp gave the option of  giving 1\/2 stars. . .  

And so with that opening sentence, here is my review:

A group of friends and I went to Dal Toro out of sheer desperation. It was a Saturday night and well, being Vegas, all the good restaurants were already booked. Now, I know that we could have gone to any restaurant but we were starving and that was the only place we could get. The restaurant is at The Palazzo and located in the lowest level of the hotel. It was actually really hard to find and feared that because we were late, our reservation had been canceled. No such thing. Upon finally arriving, we checked in with the hostess. While we waited to be seated, a bride and groom (it is Vegas after all) went up to the hostess and asked if they could accommodate a party of 23. They said they were willing to wait since it was a walk-in. The manager comes out and says that it will take about 15 minutes. Now, THAT should have been my first clue. Sadly, I thought nothing of it.

The hostess tells us that our table is ready, so we go in. Looking around, I didn't see that many people but again, didn't think twice about it. 

Our waiter comes to greet us and take our drink order. A few of us decide to get a bottle of wine while another one asked for a virgin daiquiri. The waiter tells her that they don't make frozen drinks there. So, she gets a Shirley Temple. Now, the wine selection was not that impressive and to be quite honest, they prices were a bit high.  

We get our drinks and now it's time to order.  2 get the Tuna Tartare, another on gets the Salad di Campo (which is just greens with yellow red pear tomatoes with lemon olive oil) and I get the Caesar salad. while waiting for the appetizers, we munched on the bread and this delicious pesto-type dip. The appetizers are here, yay! What a big let down. 

Let's start with the Tuna Tartare: the description said it was a spicy fresh tuna with a balsamic reduction and micro arugula. It was neither spicy nor fresh. The balsamic reduction was a drizzle on the plate, not even on the tuna. Oh and the micro arugula consisted of a sprinkle of little teeny-tiny leaves, so that was true to the description.

The salads were basic, nothing special about them.

Our waiter comes and asks how our food is. We tell him that the tuna does not taste fresh and it's pretty much a disgusting dish. He asks if we want the kitchen to make a new. Hmm, let me see. . . that would be a no! We asked for something completely different and off he went. The new appetizers were Crab Cakes and a Caprese salad. The salad was good, the crab cakes were not. We didn't say anything else because we feared that our food would get spit on.

The entrees come and we all look at each other not know what to expect and hoping to be pleasantly surprised. Sadly, that was not the case. We ordered the following: Veal Milanese, Prosciutto Pizza, Pasta with chicken and NY steak with a peppercorn brandy cream sauce.
*sigh*

The veal was crusted with  panko bread crumbs but it was so dry, cutting it was next to impossible.  Presentation wise, the pasta was a big mess but it was edible. The pizza was nice and crispy with a generous amount of prosciutto and an even more generous amount of arugula. Upon first impression, the steak looked good. However, when trying to cut it, it disappointed. I say ""trying"" because it was so tough, I had to struggle with it. It was then that I realized I was using a butter knife so I asked for a steak knife. I thought that would solve the cutting issue but again, that was not the case. I could not cut a piece for the life of me. I was arm wrestling it, no joke. The manager happened to stop by as I am doing that and asks how our food was. (I assume he heard about the tuna tartare) I tell him my steak is so tough I can't even cut it with the steak knife. So he asks if he can try to cut me a piece. Even HE struggled with it but played it off like I wasn't cutting it right. He then has the nerve to ask me what was wrong with. Really? He suggest maybe cooking it a little bit more (it was med-rare) and I tell him that that's not the problem. The problem was the big tendon-nerve running through the whole meat. I tell him that I don't want it and do not want anything else in its place. Boy was he mad! He took it and said nothing.

Not once, did he apologize or even PRETEND to feel bad for our experience. Quite frankly, we felt that we were the inconvenience and not the other way around. To be honest, we felt a bit disrespected for having spoken up. With so many restaurants and so many choices, one would think that they would go out of their way to make our dining experience a pleasant one. Our waiter never came back, that's how bad it was.

I hope that although a bit long, my review helps you in deciding whether to patronize this restaurant."	1	Dal Toro Ristorante	2.5

Awesome restaurant, great sake! Great value for money and the owner is really friendly!  Highly recommend!	5	Kushiyaki Inyo	4.5
This place is AMAZING! Not only do they have great food but INCREDIBLE customer service! I made a reservation for 11 people and as soon as we walked in we were seated right away, not all of our party came in at the same time but we were still seated. Some places u have to wait until your party arrives. Food came to our table so quick! They were all very attentive, empty plates were taken as soon as it's cleared, they asked if there's anything we would like to order. This is WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. Very impressed! Scott remembered us from our previous visit and that's very rare. Price is very reasonable. By far the best AYCE Sushi in town! And I'm very impressed with decor, atmosphere, and they played good upbeat music! Very modern!	5	Jjanga Japanese Restaurant	4
Food is "ok" this is not "Asian Fusion" as they call it. Very disappointed in service. Very slow! It took an hour for our food to completely come to table. They prioritize take out orders first and to top it off, they're "cash register" wasn't working when we were ready to pay. They even double charged our Credit Card and they were still trying to attempt a third charge! Very ashamed that this is a Filipino Restaurant!! I will never come back to this place and will not recommend to anyone!	1	Full House BBQ	4
"Went there for Valentine's Day  Brunch.

The restaurant decor itself and all of the service ware - linens, stemware, plates, etc are GORGEOUS! It must be fun to have a BIG Budget! 

Photo booth is a fun distraction when waiting for your table - and a smart little marketing tool to boot!

Orzo Meatballs were delicious as was the Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese. The buttermilk gelato with raspberry sandwiched between lemon cookies made for a simply divine dessert! A highlight of our weekend's culinary escapades! I will say, however that the plate could have used a bit of decoration\/garnish - maybe a mint leaf or a raspberry drizzle. Just a little extra effort. 

When it came to service and pacing of our meal, they really came up short. The staff were friendly but scattered. The meatballs seemed to fly out of the kitchen \/ and everything else after just crawled. We were in vacation mode - and it was still jarringly slow! My coffee - that I ordered once I realized the Prosecco Sangria was just sparkling wine poured over under ripened fruit - no infusion, macerating or flavor imparted by the fruit whatsoever - was Never refilled (despite a very slow meal!) it was overpriced but that kind of comes with the territory. And I know they are going for a minimalist vibe but if you are serving egg dishes, I think you should have salt and pepper on the table. 

Of course I would go back - because it
Is such s well decorated spot - and I love Giada!"	4	Giada	3.5
"Our best meal in Vegas! Went there for Monday morning breakfast before leaving town. 

We were seated right away, decor is fine, all decked out in French Bistro style. Service was friendly and professional. 

Corned Beef Hash was spot on. Husband's bacon was cooked as requested and very tasty. Their meat vendor deserves a raise!  

Barista was on their game too - vanilla latte was frothy and perfectly flavored. 

Worth a visit when you're in town - well run and enjoyable."	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
I am honestly giving this Buffet a 1 star just because the customer service.It was amazing every staff member working there with a great attitude.Which I honestly give them props cause its soo crazy bussy! Non stop .As far as the food not impressed at all. I was expecting great quality food since the Dinner price was $54.99 per adult.They dont have a big selection at all. And to top it off the whole experience is just waiting from the time you sign in to the time you pay, to the time you wait to be seated.Great were Inside the buffet starving after all that waiting well suprise!!! There is still long wait time at the popular selections Seafood,meat section. Like a previous person wrote its honestly just something to cross off your bucket list. Food is not good at all,Honestly dont know how it is the "Best" buffet.My favorite is still the Rio Buffet.	1	Bacchanal Buffet	4

"The Buffet is in Wynn Hotel offers various dishes that customers from all around world could enjoy the fine dining experience. Particularly line of menu are long and well presented. If you like pasta, seafood, steak, or vegetarian dishes, you name it the buffet have the exact one or similar kind. Even though the buffet offers long line of attractive dishes, some of them are not cooked well nor have the great taste like other high-end restaurants would offer in that price range. Servers who serve drinks are well mannered and very friendly: however I found out that servers (or they might call themselves as cook or chef) behind the food table area serve steak or refill foods might be busy talking to themselves and less responsive to customers' request (visited three times and observed three times). Such a restaurant in one of the best hotels in Las Vegas, I would expect the better service or, at least, have the professionalism from cooks and chefs behind of the food table area. 

* Service: Below average (compare to other high-end buffet or local restaurants in Las Vegas hotels) 
* Price: Pricy as all high-end restaurants would (you may find discount coupons from local discount shops) 
* Atmosphere: Excellent (very nice and well presented) 
* Food Quality: Slightly below average for seafood (remember you are in desert area not by ocean side) and great for dessert (wide range of dessert). 
* Parking: Valet parking is available or self-parking in Wynn hotel garage (free of charge for self-parking)
* Avoid factor: Make sure to leave some room for dessert. Be patient with cooks and chefs behind of the food table if they are busy talking to each other. Particularly, steak and meats area, Cooks\/chefs may not responsive well nor friendly. 
* Recommendation: Try their dessert (better than advertised seafood - in my opinion their seafood are overrated)."	2	The Buffet	3.5
Probly one of the best burgers I've had!! I got the double smoked bacon burger n it was delicious! I would have to say between here n gordon ramsay burgr i would say here! Great American Burger!

I cannot in good conscience even rate at one star. This office has very few good points in their favor. No one answers the phone, the reception person is beyond rude!

"Growing up on the west coast, all I ever craved was In N Out when I came to visit cali BUT Shake Shack changed everything for me. I didn't think I'd have a chance to try this east coast sensation unless I traveled all the way to NY but the stars aligned when I found it in Las Vegas. 
The fries are crinkle cut and crispy. The shake shack burger was simple but mmmm, so good. THEIR FROZEN CUSTARD THOUGH. If you were forced to order only one thing off the menu (hopefully that will never be the case), then get the frozen custard. It will make you wonder why you ever ate ice cream...creamy frozen custard in a cone is the way to go. 

Don't order the fifty\/fifty, it was watered down a bit. Eh."	5	Shake Shack	4
"I ordered 2lbs shrimp, medium, extra juicy and a side of rice. The shrimp was extremely over cooked, to the point where it was mushy. I ate less than a pound before I told my bf I was done. It was just too mushy for me. The rice was also mushy, they used way too much water. Service was alright... We didn't get our limes and salt\/pepper until I asked for it. The food took a while to come out. I prefer the Chinatown location, but the fact that this location is literally 2 mins away from me I can't complain. This venue is nicer, I love the open concept. They also have two sinks outside the bathroom, if you just needa wash your hands! 

I gave 4 stars because it's still very new, and I have no doubts that they will improve!"	4	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
"If I could give ZERO stars, I would. I'd honestly go into the negative. We made a ""reservation"" for 8:45, even called in before we arrived. The dumbass (excuse my language) at the podium said ""5 mins, your table will be ready when you're here."" We get there on time, weren't seated until 930. Oh, and they seated 6 people in a booth. My family and I are not big at all, but even we wouldn't have fit comfortably. The manager offered to get us a drink while we waited, ordered 2 miller lights... 2 seconds later, he asked ""you wanted bud light right?"" Because his friends came in and he stopped in the middle of our conversation to talk to his friends. I nearly lost it. I snapped back and said ""MILLER."" Dude, you manage an outback, your job really is not that difficult. Our waitress was alright, I suppose... Forgetful but alright. She tried her best. A for effort. We ordered a couple apps, waited and waited and waited and waited. To the point where my dad, brother and I craved a cigarette. So they started walking outside, for a smoke, the dumbass at the podium said ""if you go out, you can't come back in, company policy"" when they told me that, I was livid. I told her, I'm gonna have a smoke, and get my wallet unless you don't want me paying for this dinner. Honestly, it's pretty bad if you start craving a cig in between apps and entree. Anyways, steaks came out... Warm. Ordered medium rare, my steak nearly gave me lock jaw from chewing it so much. We should've saved this horrible experience by eating at the damn chili's next door. I swear, a blind, tasteless person could've cooked a better steak than the chefs in charge of this joint. Sorry to be so harsh, but this is seriously the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I want this meal comped, and matter of fact, I'd like to be reimbursed for my time wasted in this restaurant. 

My conclusion, if you want to get treated like nothing, be surrounded by the dumbest staff in America and eat DOG FOOD, then this outback is the right place for you! 

To the blond hostess, that sucks so bad at the easiest job in the world... Congrats. You're employee of the month!"	1	Outback Steakhouse	3.5
I was so excited to try this place! I dragged my sisters and boyfriend here for lunch... Highly disappointed :( I love soup and was eager to try all the soups they had... I ordered the mushroom bisque after having samples of the lobster and cauliflower. Needless to say, I prefer Campbell's mushroom soup from the can. I got the pick 2 combo, turkey bacon avocado. Again, first bite I was disappointed. For some reason, the sandwich was sweet? I asked for regular yellow mustard, and when I opened my sandwich the bread looked like it was drizzled with honey. I literally took a few bites and called it quits. My boyfriend and sisters, also not impressed. Only thing my boyfriend liked was the sauce they used on his Italian club. I did enjoy the complimentary chocolate covered strawberry though. Definitely made the lunch better. Sadly, I will not be returning. I'll stick to canned soup and homemade sandwiches or Panera Bread.	1	Cafe Zupas	3.5
"Being a true lover of Settebello, I have to admit myself, I was truly impressed!! My boyfriend had mentioned seeing a new pizza place and wanted to try it. I was skeptical that it would beat Settebello, but first bite of our piping hot pizza... I had a change of heart. We ordered spicy marinara, lots of fresh garlic, whole roasted garlic, basil, spicy salami and banana peppers. Chef Marc explained to us the style of pizza it was and how it's made to eat a certain way. I asked him to make it extra crispy and he said he would try his best. We sat down, got all our necessary seasonings and chef Marc brought our pizza to us. Oh man! Crust was super crispy and the flavor of just the crust was amazing! I could eat the crust alone! All of our toppings were complimenting each other so well. I love how they offer spicy marinara! Because it adds even more flavor to the pizza. Every bite, my eyes were huge and I was satisfied. I kept raving about how good it was after each bite!

Only thing I could ""complain"" about is the atmosphere. If it were a more cozy restaurant, where it didn't feel like I was just grabbing something quick. I really like Settebello's environment. It makes lunch on a sunny day so much better! But that's the only ""bad"" thing I could say.

I DEFINITELY recommend this place for any pizza lover. Don't be skeptical, I know there's hardcore Settebello lovers out there, but I encourage you to try this. It's amazing! I'll be coming here every time I crave pizza :)"	5	Novecento Pizzeria	4

Don't even waste your valuable time in SIN CITY going to this place. 1st off we get there a party of 12 , they bring chips and salsa right away which we're good, but then the horror starts.

I had 7 MARES and it had a nasty taste.The meals took for ever not to mention they ran out of MENUDO, who the HELL runs out of menudo on Saturday morning.

"I had the pleasure of trying Lazy Joes for the first time it was an excellent dinning experience! I must say that it was by far the very best Gluten Free fish I have ever had.
I loved the seasoned French Fries. The Value you get for the all you can eat Fish and all you can eat shrimp was excellent.  if your dinning with a friend one of you can get the all you can eat fish while the other gets the all you can eat shrimp and then share it was amazing! The Cole slaw was also a highlight of the meal. the only down side is its a small restaurant so large groups of more than six  may have a hard time sitting together. I recommend Lazy Joe's Fish and Chips"	4	Lazy Joe's Fish & Chips	3.5

"Decided to try this place for the convenience (in our hotel) and the lobster mac & cheese.

When we arrived, there were four young ladies (staff) at the hostess stand talking to each other.  We were asked how many in our party, but they didn't shift to customer service mode very quickly. Our party of four stood there awkwardly for a bit before being seated.  

It took a bit for our server to show up to the table, but he was friendly and helpful when he did.  He was knowledgeable about the menu and the Yelp check in for a free (house) beer (when you order a burger).  After we ordered, he delivered the house popcorn that had a little spice kick to it...pretty good stuff.   

We didn't have silverware and napkins... not sure which staff is responsible, but neither the hostess who seated us nor our server noticed.  We had to get up and ask for it from someone after our popcorn was brought to the table (hence, we'd been there a while)...

I had the Rising Sun, an Asian fusion burger made of kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado - cooked a little rarer than my requested medium well, but fine with me.  It was pretty tasty!!

Two people ordered the lobster mac - one said it was okay and one said it was really good.

The atmosphere is lively with a DJ playing a variety upbeat of music.  

Overall, the food is good but the service needs improvement."	3	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4

"I was so excited to hear they opened a Serendipity here.

It was a must to come and have a frozen hot chocolate.
We arrived in the afternoon and it was packed for a Monday.
We had to reserve and wait, but the bar seating was open.
It was a treat to sit there because we were able to watch the bartender make some yummy drinks.

We had a glass of sangria which was fresh and just good.
The frozen hot chocolate was just as I expected. I tried the Peanut Sin City Frrrozen Hot Mocha which had a shot of peanut rum.

We also ordered a cheeseburger and sweet potato shoe strings.
The sweet potato shoe strings were off the hook. I haven't had sweet potato fries like that.

Definitely will come back!"	5	Serendipity 3	3
If you choose a restaurant based on service alone, this is your place. But I don't know too many that do that. Our server, Amanda, was attentive and wonderful. I've never met a macaroni and cheese I didn't like until now. The cheese was more like the queso we had at Yolos the day before and had no more than 10 small macaroni noodles in it. My husband likes the creamed spinach. The Caesar salad lacked some flavor. The steak was kind of mealy tasting and the Parmesan crust is a waste. The crust just falls off when you cut the steak and it's too thick a slab of cheese. The lobster was also kind of chewy and lacked some flavor. Disappointed in this especially considering the prices you pay at steak restaurants. The grapefruit Moscow mules are delicious.	2	Strip House Steak House	4
Sat at the bar and had great service. The food all lacked flavor which is disappointing bc you expect so much flavor at a Mexican restaurant. We had shrimp fajitas and the shrimp were cooked perfectly but it needed some spice and\/or seasoning. Same with the guacamole, no flavor. Good salsa and chips though.	3	YOLOS	3.5

cheap, good, late night food. try the oxtail soup!! the won ton saimin was good too. it's a $20 cab ride from the strip and the downtown area is a little sketchy looking (compared to the strip), but if you have a car, go for it! the oxtail soup is only served from 11pm-11am, though.	4	Market Street Cafe	3.5

My cousins went here a couple weekends prior and said this place sucked. I shoulda figured it'd just gone downhill in the last year. Or maybe I shoulda checked my previous review first. My dumb ass ordered the bun bo hue. Shoulda gone with the fried pho. Maybe that's still good..	2	Pho So 1	3.5
"Pretty decent food, I was pleasantly surprised. Huge portions on the salads. I mean, huge. For real. Great service. The chicken tortilla soup was thick, way heartier than I expected, but good nonetheless. And fish tacos were good too. The rice and beans? Take it back. I can do better from a can or a box of instant.

I liked the french toast. And the tuna melt. It wasn't too greasy or mayo-y. Could've benefited from some veggies tho. The potatoes were good too. Great service. I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but if I was in the neighborhood, I'd stop in again.	3	The Original Sunrise Cafe	4.5
The food for dinner service was excellent. It's perfect for a date or to bring the whole family. The service was top notch all the way around. The food was amazing we were a party of three and ordered three different items so we could get a feel for the place. Everything was perfect. I recommend the Chicken Tikka Marsala at a level 5 spice. I love when a place gives you the option of how spicy you like your food from a scale of 1-10 because they make it fresh from scratch. I can't wait to try the lunch buffet. The bill was fair considering an upscale restaurant, top service and quality food.	5	Angara Indian Spice Grill	4.5
I'm @ panera 5 days a week and its always five stars. All the staff and management are great. Nick, Luke and Angela are always more than helpful. When it comes to food it's hard finding a place that's consistent. I highly recommend the bagels they are soft and fresh and perfect to start the day.	5	Panera Bread	3.5
"This place has an excellent atmosphere, clean floors\/tables, great service and perfect pizza. The variety is the key because you can just keep coming back and experimenting with all the unique combinations. Personally I like the jalapeño and the margarita. Don't forget to save some room for the tiramisu. This is a great spot for a date, group of friends or the whole family. I felt like I was at home as soon as I walked in and was greeted promptly. The place is upscale quality with reasonable pricing which always makes me happy. Also the portions were hearty and not skimpy and you can tell that the meat was fresh and well prepped and not just thrown on at the last minuet like most pizzerias are doing these days... 
Overall I just had to give a five because the place is so well rounded and after multiple visits the consistency in quality really won me over."	5	Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana	4
This place is not a five it's a 10 ! You can not beat the tamales here no matter how hard you try. The tamales are stuffed full of juicy meat not all just full of corn meal !im talking stuffed to the max with the best juiciest meat it's unreal !! The green sauce is so good I can drink it down out of a glass. Everything is made in house and all original recipes !!! Amazing just amazing really I can't get enough. Sometimes I just order a dozen to go with a large container of green sauce and take it home. The best Tamales in the world !!!	5	Dona Maria Tamales Restaurant	3.5
Just went to greens and proteins because it was recommended by my neighbor. First of all the place is spotless and the staff is friendly. I was skeptical because healthy food tends to be poor in taste but this is not the case at G&P. The chocolate and peanut butter shake was excellent and I had no clue there were vegetables mixed in. Then the meal came out and wow the whole wheat French toast was scrumptious ! This place has completely changed my mind about health food tasting like cardboard that's for sure. The owner himself even came out to greet me and ask how my meal was. I give five stars for the original recipe, the cleanliness of the establishment and the fact that the owner has direct involvement in the operation. This is always indicates that someone takes pride in what they do and wants the best quality products\/services for their customers. I'll be back soon.	5	Greens and Proteins	4
Love it love it love it chicken is off the hook. I've eaten here a hundred times and never been disappointed. The consistency is the key because you know the quality is always there and you don't have to think twice. Too many places have different cooks and its hit or miss. The chicken is amazing the pulled pork sandwich is very nice as well. Go in grab a half chicken with honey mustard sauce and let me know what you think.	5	Nevada Chicken Cafe	3.5
Excellent quality food, the sandwiches and soups are always hooked up just right. I'm always customizing my orders and they are always coming out exactly how I ask. I order delivery to my business and to my home. The manager Joe is on top of his game he must be double checking the orders because they never come incorrectly. I highly recommend the broccoli cheese soup and the Cuban press. The chocolate chip cookies are always soft and freshly baked. Thanks to all the staff for making the food consistently and delivering on time !	5	Jason's Deli	3.5
This is a full five star restaurant. The service is as good as it can be and the food is always on the level. This place really goes out of its way to put that little extra something on the plate. Whoever doesn't like Juan's just simply doesn't know good Mexican food. I have been eating here from the day it opened and I'm not going to stop anytime soon. Thanks to all the staff at Juan's ill be back soon as usual. Highly recommend the breakfast burritos and the chimichangas !!!!	5	Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina	4.5
I am from New York originally and until now I couldn't find edible Italian food for a reasonable price in Las Vegas. When I make large delivery orders they always throw in some garlic knots or cookies on the house !!! I have tried everything on the menu and haven't found something I didn't like yet ! The food is always on point and even after I moved farther away they still deliver to me all the way out on trop and fort apache ! I love these guys because they know the value of their customers and they show their appreciation by taking extra care. The sandwiches are always fully loaded and the meat is quality. Thanks you guys for giving me a taste of home.	5	Rocco's	4
My favorite breakfast place in the neighborhood. I know the staff well after all my visits they call me by name. I'm here twice a week for breakfast or lunch. I recommend the biscuits but everything is great. The key to this place is that everything is made from scratch including the sauces that come with the food. The customer service is excellent and the prices are super reasonable. The lowest prices in this area by FAR. Go to original house of pancakes your paying for every single thing A la carter.. ok I think the bastards even charge for butter and syrup separately 47 dollars for a two person meal. My cousin and I were at biscuits to burgers the other day had breakfast for 19 bucks out the door. Better quality then the competition and at a realistic price. The place is never too crowded that you don't get the proper attention from the staff and you won't be waiting outside for 30 minuets like at OHP.	5	Biscuits 2 Burgers	4
The woman bartending tonight was incredibly welcoming, even shared her nachos while I waiting for my food and tended to the other customers in a fashionable manner :) the cook there tonight did an awesome job on our order. Thanks for the great first impression guys, I will be coming back every so often to grab some dinner!	5	Kopper Keg West	4
Pulling up in a lyft was a bit questionable due to the shopping center this restaurant is in, but I am so glad I went in. Service was fast and the Lobster Eggs Benedict was delicious. This place was also very reasonably priced! Coming back for sure.	5	Omelet House	4.5
Attempted to enjoy this restaurant twice when it was Extreme Sushi and was disappointed both times. With the change in ownership and name I thought it was time to try again. I had high hopes, but again they were not met. The service was ok, but nothing exceptional. The selection on the menu was good, but the actual food was disappointing. The rolls were creative, but piece size and ingredient distribution were inconsistent. The Sushi pieces were small and the rice didn't hold together. Maybe I set my expectations too high, but I expect perfection when it comes to sushi and only one place has met that expectation... Kobe Sushi on the 215 and Rainbow.	3	Kazuki Sushi	3.5
While I will continue to eat at this establishment, I will only do so because it is the closet Chicago food place near my work, otherwise I would completely avoid this place due to its outrageous pricing. There are better tasting and cheaper options all over the valley.	2	Chicago Dogs	3
"My friends invited us to dinner here as our one fancy dinner night in Vegas. I'm a steak lover and enjoy going out for a good steak. I wasn't that turned off by the prices as I'll pay good money for a good steak.

First off the service was very good. Waiters were attentive and friendly, hence the second star.

However, the food was not good at all. I have to say the only thing that was tasty were the buns they brought to the table. The steaks were flavorless and all 4 of us at the table agreed that the meal was sub par. Those steaks might be worth 1\/3 of the price they were charging. 

I know it's Vegas and you pay a premium but I can guarantee you a better meal at another restaurant for a fraction of the price. We paid $225 per couple for 3 drinks, 3 sides, and 4 entrees. Pretty dissatisfied."	2	Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak	4
"Staying at the Aria and stopped here for an early dinner as soon as we arrived on Christmas Day. Restaurant was only 1\/2 full, but we were told the wait would be 20 minutes, so we opted to sit at the bar. Service was quick and we watched a basketball game. We ordered the salmon spring rolls for an appetizer. These were top notch...salmon, cheese, and basil fried in a slim roll with sweet chili dipping sauce. I ordered the Pad See Ewe (spelling?) at a spicy level 3 out 10 and the man ordered Pad Thai with Chicken at level 5. The Pad See Ewe was just ok, I'm not sure it was meant for spiciness and it also needed more veggies! The Pad Thai was excellent! 

Only real issue was the bartender, who doubled as our server. He was loud and ignorant...we found many of his comments to be inappropriate and offensive."	3	Lemongrass	3.5
Tasty, but BEYOND greasy.  Being from Chicago, we are pizza snobs, but this was by far the greasiest pizza we've ever had.  We both had a to-go slice of the forager (white pizza) to bring back to the room.  The box and three to four napkins were soaked with grease before I could take a bite...I was glad I had a sink to wash my hands and face when done, but it was quite tasty, just not what I'm used to.  Because it's so limp, they should give you a fork and knife with purchase, as it's very difficult to eat with your hands  But I'm a pizza diva.	3	Five50 Pizza Bar	4
Awesome food and awesome service.  We arrived around 8:45am on a Friday and waited about 20 minutes, not too bad.  Our server, Lonzo, was quick and knowledgeable.  We ordered the famous Chicken and waffles and the corned beef hash breakfast.  Both did not disappoint.  Hash House A GoGo is WORTH the wait Vegas Diners!  It is inside the Linq Hotel, on the second floor.	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
Choose Aria Cafe for breakfast on our last day because Aria doesn't really offer much else for breakfast other than the buffet and Starbucks. We were pleasantly surprised at the quick service and quality of the food. Our server was very professional and attentive. We each got an omelette, the ham & cheese and the Ultimate Omelette, which had shrimp, goat cheese, and asparagus. Both came with two hash brown "cakes" and toast. The hash browns might be the best I've ever had! It's a little pricey, but what isn't in Vegas!?!?	4	ARIA Café	2.5
Only stopped in for a drink, but would definitely come back.  The atmosphere and service were spot on.  You walk in and automatically forget you are in a casino with the quiet irish background music playing to set the mood.  You cant go wrong with a glass of wine and a pint of beer, but we were very happy to escape the sounds of slot machines, smell of smoke, and catch the end of a football game on their big screen for 30 minutes,	5	Nine Fine Irishmen	4
"There is not much else to say other than Babystacks is hands down AMAZING. I come here at least once a month, if not more. I am never disappointed. Service is always on point. Clearly, all of the employees enjoy working there because they are always in a great mood. The food is also freakin awesome. I've tried so many things on this menu and have never once been disappointed. One of my personal favorite breakfast foods is biscuits and gravy and Babystacks has the best plate of biscuits and gravy that I have ever had. 

If you want an outstanding breakfast, go to Babystacks."	5	BabyStacks Cafe	4
No reviews & open 24 hours, 7 days made us very leery to order but gave it a shot. Pleasantly surprised. Crust was excellent...not too thick. Great taste, good cheese & fast delivery.	5	Mama's Pizza	3
"My wife and I went to Bouchon for brunch with high expectations.  Unfortunately we got a late start and got there about 5 minutes before brunch was over and were told that they were now serving ""Express Lunch"" and had a menu thrust at us to review .  We were disappointed but our lateness was our own fault, so we figured we'd give lunch a try anyway. We were seated near a window and not far from the server station.  The restaurant was about 1\/2 full and 2-3 servers were frequently standing at the server station chatting away.  The problem was that no one ever came by to serve us.  We waited 15-20 minutes and not even a glass of water was poured.

During the 20 minutes we waited, no one else came into the restaurant.  As we walked out the host told us to have a nice day and had no clue that we were the last people he seated.  When I commented to him why we were leaving, he asked if I would like to speak to someone.  Apparently he was not a someone, just a somebody in an over sized jacket. I would have thought that he would have not even asked the question, but instead insist on bringing over a manager.

The good thing about this is that as we walked back through the shops, we stopped at a little bistro that was serving both breakfast and lunch that had excellent service and very good food.  In the end it was a much better experience than I think we would have had at Bouchon, had we ever been served.

Now I'm sure this review comes off as being a bit snooty.  However when you decide to dine at the restaurants in Vegas that are rated among the best, there are certain minimum expectations that you come with. To me customer service and food quality were big ones, and I experienced them every where else but Bouchon."	1	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
"First off, expect to spend a LOT of money here. This ain't Black Angus or Lone Star. No $10 steaks here! Some friends and I went here to stay at a timeshare. Since my friend got the room, I bought dinner here for the three of us. We all got the filet mignon, a couple side dishes, and lots of drinks. The menu is a la carte, so it can get a bit pricey. But you get to choose what you want and the sides are enough to feed several people. 

The filets were amazing! They brought them out on a big cast iron skillet. Just the steak and nothing else. No fancy presentation needed. I've had better filets (not many better than that), but this is right up there with them as one of the best I have ever had. The food was amazing!

The atmosphere inside of the restaurant is very nice too. It is dark and very romantic feeling. A great place to bring your girl. The service was also very good. They have a fantastic wine list that is reasonably priced. I didn't have desert, because we filled up on our meal and drinks.

Next trip to Vegas and I'm stopping back in here again."	5	Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak	4
"It's been a while since I have been here, but this was always a favorite stop for my friends and I on our last day in Vegas. They have a gigantic Harley above the entrance and an even bigger American flag made out of chains inside. I also like the ""railroad"" thing they have going on with all of the Harleys on it. It's like a big Harley showroom on a conveyor belt. You can check out all of the Harleys as they move across the restaurant above you. (I'm hoping they still have all of this). One of the few places I've eaten at that has rock music blasting from it's speakers. They also have a lot of autographed gas tanks and motorcycle displays throughout the place.

The food is pretty good and you get a lot of it. I usually get the roasted half-chicken with some mashed potatoes and corn. That's a lot of food! The service has always been great and I haven't had a bad meal there yet. 

This is a really cool place to hang out, especially if you like Harley Davidsons. I'd recommend it if you are looking for a fun place to eat in Vegas."	4	Harley-Davidson Las Vegas Cafe	3
"First off, I would have given this place a better rating, but the service knocked it down a couple of stars. I would normally have said something to them about the service, but I had to leave right after eating and didn't get a chance to wait around for a manager.

Food - 5 star
Service - 1 star

I ordered the Tagliata (fillet, of course!), which came with a sauteed spinach and a red wine reduction. Not as good as the Craftsteak restaurant across the hall, but still very good.  Why did I order a steak here anyway, knowing that Craftsteak was across the way? Oh well.

Now of the service. The waiter brought out my menu and came back about 10 minutes later to get my food order. I placed my order and he walked away without even taking my drink order. Uh, hello, I wanted some wine.

I flagged down the hostess and asked for the wine list, which she promptly brought back to me (Thank you!). I didn't see my waiter until he brought out my food and then I had to place my drink order. I ordered a half bottle of wine. He brought it out and set it on my table and then said he would be right back and walked away. He went to another table to take their order and talk with them, then disappeared. Uh, my wine wasn't opened yet. He then came back to open my wine and pulled the same stunt again. Except this time he disappeared for about five minutes where I couldn't see him. I finally got my wine opened and forgot all about the bad service. The food was terrific.

I got called to a private party just as I was finishing my food, so I couldn't speak with a manager about this. Otherwise, I would have. That is, if I could have found one. I only saw the hostess and waiter the entire time I was there. (I was sitting in the ""patio"" area where you could see all the people walking by.) Not sure what the ""inside"" of the restaurant looked like. I put those words in quotes, because if this place was outside that is what they would have been called.

As I walked out, the hostess asked me how everything was. I told her the food was incredible, but my waiter wouldn't even do a good job as a greeter at Wal-Mart. Not sure what her reaction was, because I didn't stick around to find out. I will definitely try this place again, because I'm sure that waiter is gone by now or if he's still there, I won't get him again."	3	Fiamma Italian Kitchen	4
"I heard great things about this particular buffet but it just reminded me of a higher quality old country buffet. the food was unoriginal and there weren't that many options. and the maki rolls...sigh. 

The line is unnecessary long and i would recommend visiting another buffet. the wait is not worth it."	2	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
"Forget the bellagio, wicked spoon is  what's up. 

The food is fresh, unique, cutely\/smartly served in tiny portions, and sophisticated for a buffet. 

The options are unlike any other buffets - it felt as though i was going to a 5 star restaurant and their entrees were buffet items. Example, they serve gelato. You won't find that at the bellagio or OCB. 

It was also refreshing that there wasn't a huge line. It told me they were more about the service rather than showing off."	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
I love this place!! The biscuit sandwiches are amazing!! The manager Steve went above and beyond to help me out!!	5	Yardbird Southern Table & Bar	4.5
Heads up the hostess here is well not a hostess no better way to say it ! So slow we ended up just walking in and seating ourselves! I got the fried chicken it was great!! I would have given a higher rating but that hostess was just bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!	3	Pantry - 24 Hour Kitchen	3.5
"This is a good buffet for varieties of food they have american,european, & asian cuisine. knowing the asian in me, Iam looking forward for that good ol' fried rice, i love their calamari, i was saving a room for a lot of food  God forgive me for my gluttony that day..but still there are so many of them that its impossible to taste it all.. that's what i hate in a buffet i feel i have the right to eat them all but it's very impossible.err.. they have it all DID i need to say all food that you can think of.. from steak ,pizza etc. yay! don't go there if you're on a diet. you'll goin to ruin everything! hahah!

Oh by the way i like their automated machine which works like an atm. which also gives you exact change.. no hassle very smooth.."	4	Bayside Buffet at Mandalay Bay	3
Talk about BIG PORTIONS with a diner feel.  I have been to two different Hash House A Go Go in Las Vegas and they were both very good.  This particular location is right on the strip so we did have to wait for a table for about 30 minutes or more.  We went into the casino and did a little shopping and came back and we was seated immediately.  We had breakfast each time we came and couldn't finish any of our food on our plates.  We left with big bellies and smiles on our faces.	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
With a handful of new sushi burrito places in my neighborhood I decided to give Teds a try especially with the great grand opening special they are currently having. Buy 1 get 1 half off for the month of October. Good deal in my book. I ordered a create your own spicy tuna burrito and my husband ordered the  sashimi oishi bowl. All for a whopping $16 with the discount. The poke tasted great, the toppings were fresh and the different sauces were flavorful. The restaurant, although small, was very clean and service was on point. While enjoying our meal the servers brought out a small side of house appetizer which was pickled cucumbers and carrots which was a nice little touch. I will definitely be returning to Teds to try their other amazing menu items!	5	Ted's Sushi Burrito	4.5
"Finally stopped in for happy hour with some friends yesterday and we were not disappointed. We enjoyed the beautiful outdoor seating area although, it get loud at times due to the close proximity to the airport. We didn't mind though, it was kind of fun watching the planes land and take off. Flemings has great happy hour specials with food and drink specials starting at $6 everyday from 5-7pm. My friends and I brought our own bottles of champagne for which they charge a $20 fee for corking per bottle which is reasonable for a nice restaurant in Vegas. The happy hour burger was absolutely delicious with Gruyere cheese and served with a side of well seasoned french fries...definitely a 5\/5. My friend had the mushroom ravioli which she enjoyed as well and gave it a 5\/5. 

We were a little disappointed with the service which was 3\/5. Our server forgot an appetizer we had ordered and upon inquiring about it she immediately blamed us for not even placing the order when all of us at the table heard her confirm the order back to us when we initially placed it. She later came and apologized telling us she couldn't read her own handwriting. There were many times through the night that we had to pour our own drinks and an ice bucket for our champagne was brought to the table after we were done with 3\/4 of the bottle. 

Despite the glitch in service we will definitely be returning to Flemings for the great ambience, delicious food and of course the amazing happy hour specials!"	4	Fleming's Prime Steakhouse	4
Finally stopped in here with my husband for happy hour and I must say...prob one of the best happy hour spots in Vegas! I mean who can beat $1 oysters with 3 different delicious sauces on the side!? We also ordered the deviled eggs with a  fried oyster on top and it was probably the best deviled eggs I've ever had. Cocktails were unique and quality especially the whiskey manhattans. Good quality craft beers on tap. We sat at the bar and the restaurant was not too busy at 5pm on a Thursday when they open for happy hour. Service was fast and friendly and they explained all their specials very well. I can't wait to go back to this restaurant. Prices compliment the food well.	5	Other Mama	4.5
Visited with a few friends because it was close to home. Food and service were both okay. In a town where there's a vast variety of AYCE sushi places this one didn't really have a wow factor that would make me want to return on a regular basis. I might stop here again if I wanted something quick without having to drive too far.	3	Sumo Sushi 2	3.5
Husband and I finally decided to try  this place after talking about it for months. Location of the restaurant appears to be in a very popular and busy plaza but parking is ample to accommodate the crowds. My husband ordered the very popular "big bone" bone marrow pho. He enjoyed the flavor and highly complimented the taste of the broth. The soup naturally required a lot of messy work to eat and for $18 I would think it included noddles but thats an option for an extra $2. Overall though my husband gave it a 4\/5. I ordered the double down which included Kalbi short ribs, Chinese sausage with a side of rice topped with an egg. Very hearty dish and good portion. I had enough leftover to take home for another meal. We ended our meal with their coconut ice cream served in an actual coconut. Delicious and the perfect end to a great meal. The highlight of our meal was definitely the pho. Can't wait to return and try more of their yummy noodle soups!	4	District One	4
I have visited DW Bistro many times both for lunch and dinner and the food has consistently impressed me every single time. The decor of the restaurant is very modern contemporary with beautiful splashes of color and natural lighting. The menu offers many unique items with a bold mix of flavors. They also have a variety of cocktails some of which are daily infusions of tropical flavors. The only reason for 4 stars is the inconsistent service we have received as regulars. Luckily the food makes up for that. We will definitely continue to return.	4	DW Bistro	4.5
Stopped by here with my husband tonight and we were pleasantly surprised. Spacious restaurant with easy to choose menu. All hotdogs, minus the veggie dog, are bacon wrapped with 3 different bun options. There's also a secret menu which we were educated on by our pleasant cashier\/bartender. Good beer choices on tap although they were out of a few due to changing out the kegs. Overall a good neighborhood restaurant with good service, good beer and delicious hot dogs. Will be visiting again.	4	Dirt Dog	4.5
My review is based solely on their happy hour. Stopped in with a friend for a after work martini only to be disappointed. I am a regular dirty martini drinker and the dirty martini I had here was honestly one of the worst ones I've ever had. It tasted purely of olive juice with shriveled up olives served in the drink. My friend had a apple martini which tasted like pre mixed syrup. Truly disappointed because the the location is great with great ambience. We had big expectations for a great martini since it's called "The Martini". We will not be returning here for happy hour.	1	The Martini	4
One of the best happy hour spots on the strip! The outdoor patio seating is beautiful with hanging lights and an open atmosphere. My friends and I have been here many times for happy hour and have never left disappointed. Good drinks that range from $3-5 during happy hour with great food specials. We absolutely love the loaded nachos which comes in perfect portion. The happy hour tacos are bite size starting at $2 depending on what type you get. Definitely a local and tourist favorite.	5	El Segundo Sol	4
"My girlfriends and I frequent this place often. We enjoy their happy hour specials which is half off all cocktails everyday from 4-8pm. They have a wide selection of martinis and other crafted cocktails. Some of our favorites are the dirty martini, pear martini, lychee martini and the morning after cocktail. They have a large outdoor seating area with an outdoor bar as well. Service is always inconsistent and there are times when it's easier to order a drink at the bar instead of waiting for someone to come to the table. Getting a table has never been an issue when I've gone with my friends which is usually between 4-730pm any day of the week. 

Food menu is limited to appetizers only such as flatbreads, dips, fruit and cheese plate and other simple varieties. No wow factor with the bites but they are also half off during happy hour. 

Overall and good local bar\/lounge with fun cocktails and martinis that I will continue returning to."	4	Blue Martini Lounge	3.5
Great neighborhood restaurant that's always consistent with great eats. I've stopped in here a handful of times and I've never left disappointed. My favorites are the green and yellow curry, basil fried rice and their various noodle dishes. They have a very extensive menu with many vegetarian options for those interested. Today my friend and I had the chicken basil fried rice and the tofu pad see ew. Both dishes were very flavorful and the spice levels were just as we had requested....spicy!! They have beer and wine on the menu. Prices are very reasonable. My friend and I paid no more then $10 for each dish and we both had leftovers. No wow factor here but a great overall restaurant with delicious food. I will continue to return here.	4	Surang's Thai Kitchen	4
First visit today and definitely not the last! Extensive menu with great variety of options. The menu is a bit overwhelming but the servers were very helpful. Lychee Chu-hai cocktail was absolutely delicious with a refreshing summer floral taste. We ordered the tonkatsu ramen, miso salmon and tuna belly appetizer all of which were delicious! Overall, good service, great food and yummy cocktails! Cannot wait to return and taste the other delicious menu items!	5	Izakaya Go	4.5
"Second time visiting this location and I loved it just as much as I did the first time. There was no wait for a table at around 1:30pm on a Monday and service was fast and attentive. We ordered some nice cold brews that they have on tap as the waiter made menu recommendations to us. We decided on the oxtail chili cheese fries as an appetizer which was very good however it did have more chili then I would've liked  but that didn't stop me from eating half the plate. We ordered the Miyagi-San burger which is their most popular burger which was 5\/5. The spicy miso burger which had a good kick to it and also 5\/5. The Kalbi burger which comes with a side of kimchi also 5\/5. Burgers were perfectly cooked and the buns had a nice toasty crunch to it. 
Prices range from $9 for a basic burger and extra for add ons to $15 for their gourmet burgers. A bit pricey for a burger joint but their gourmet burgers are very filling and portions are huge and can be shared. I will definitely be returning!"	5	Bachi Burger	4
This is one of the few happy hour places I've been to with my friends that has been consistent every single time. The lychee martini and kiwilicious drinks are amazing with real fruits in them. Food is average but the drinks, service and ambience makes up for it. I will keep returning for their happy hour specials.	5	Geisha House Steak & Sushi	4
HUGE fan of The boiling crab! I can honestly say I crave and visit this place at least once a month! Nothing beats the shebang sauce with your choice of seafood and a variety of sides such as corn, potatoes and delicious sausages. My go to menu items are shrimp or crab with half a pound of sausages and a side of corn. My only issue with this place is the long wait on weekends and price increase in the last few months but that hasn't stopped me from my frequent visits. The restaurant is very spacious with ample parking and great customer service. If you plan to go on a weekend day between 6-8pm be prepared to wait at least 30-45 mins. Worth the wait in my book.	5	The Boiling Crab	4
Brought some out of town friends here for Sunday brunch and I was glad I did. $19.98 for 5 brunch options and endless mimosa, Bellini, and bloody Mary's....amazing deal! $12.98 without the alcoholic beverages. We had the smokehouse hash 4\/5 and the bacon steak with grits 4\/5. Service was great and the restaurant itself is quite large with spacious seating. Their jalapeño jelly which accompanied the bacon steak was amazing especially for those who enjoy spicy flavors. I would love to return for their AYCE rib night on Mondays. Pot liquor is a keeper for a weekend brunch option.	4	Pot Liquor CAS	3.5
Not the best Vietnamese place I've been to in Vegas but definitely fulfills the craving when I don't feel like driving to Chinatown. The portions are quite big and reasonable. Their boba teas are yummy! I'm waiting for them to add Vietnamese sandwiches to their menu. I would've given them an extra star if they had sandwiches.	3	Jenni Pho	3
"I have been lurking on Yelp for a number of months now, maybe a year even. I finally signed up so I could add my 2 cents about this place.

Don't think about it, just go. The food is AMAZING.

This is DEFINITELY on the list of places to go every time I'm in Vegas. Yes, it is a ways off the strip, but JUST GO. Get a taxi if you have to, it's worth it!

The cheesecake: to die for. 

Scampi YUM. 

My friend had lobster ravioli that was delicious--big lobster chunks, not minced-up-probably-lobster. 

We also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, but I'd recommend going with pork roulade instead. SO GOOD."	5	Zest - Bistro & Bar	4.5
Worst service ever. Buy 2 pretzel and large drink and get free pretzel, and display pretzel cups and don't honor that such false advertisement. Not a happy customer. Then they start arguing and getting defensive. If I could not give a star I would. They need to fix this. Use a pretzel picture instead of the pretzel cup	1	Auntie Anne's Soft Pretzel	2.5
Family member suggested we come here. The rice was fresh, the food was excellent the portions were excellent, the service was excellent. They substitute some items we were unfamiliar with for those we were. If I had a gripe it would be it's not a place you sit down and eat. There's a TV but it wasn't on for those who wait. There's music but it's Chinese. It's almost like they don't want you to stay and eat. Since that was our intention there's no harm.	5	China Passion	4.5
Fast, very, very friendly service. Food was above average. We ate at a nearby casino with a breakfast special of $5.99. This place was $10.00 more on my bill, BUT I have a better experience! Lots of stuff on the menu, looking forward to coming back tomorrow.	5	Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant	4
I had great expectations due to reviews. The food was excellent! Portion size for the first time in life I needed a carry out!  Service was SUB PAR! I waited too long to meet my server and get drinks and refills. I was missing a whole portion of my order. The service left much to be desired. In their defense, it seemed crowded and I think they were unprepared. I'm in Vegas for 9 days to bury my father. I was looking for a"go to" place while in town. I don't know if I would go back. If the service was better they would have gotten 5stars, the food was just that good.	3	Black Bear Diner	3.5
Went based on reviews. Ordered a pizza a wings. Wings were overcooked and very small. Pizza was 1step above LITTLE CEASERS -twice the price and wait. Im angry and want my money back. I m from Chicago. I know good pizza. This AIN'T good pizza!!	1	Joey's Pizza	3
Always take ant opportunity to visit Tommy Bahama Restaurant. This one doesn't disappoint. A little off the strip and with all of the favorites. Service is great food is always outstanding. Don't miss when in Vegas!	5	Tommy Bahama Restaurant | Bar | Store - Las Vegas	4
In the Bellagio this restaurant is a delightful combination of flavors and choices with amazing ingredient. The carts that come by are a great idea. No matter what you like this restaurant has something for you. Great cocktails and an expansive wine list. Service is over the top. Definitely worth the visit.	5	Harvest by Roy Ellamar	4
I just recently moved into this neighborhood. I love curry and saw the 4 outa 5 stars and was excited to check them out! It was Wednesday night around 8:15pm. There was one person in front of me. I was reading the overhead menu deciding what I wanted to order while I was in LINE. Another patron walked in the front door. The front counter girl knew him and and he started to rattle off his order. I told her that had been waiting and that the guy cut in front of me. She continued to help the guy who cut because she obviously knew him. Too bad I had to leave immediately without ordering and I'll NEVER go back due to the lack of customer service at Curry Zen. She didn't care and proceeded to talk crap about me to the loyal customer.  As a small business owner I'd be appalled if ANY of  my customers were not treated equally.  I'm not sure if it was just this employee or a management issue but I'll be sure to not patronize this business and tell ALL friends likewise.	1	Curry Zen	4
Great Shakes.   The burgers also tasted very good. Reasonably priced and that is hard to find in Vegas. They are also open late so even more convenient.	4	Shake Shack	4
"Wow what a bomb ass sandwich!  A few weeks ago I was testing the water at our Float Sanctuary Las Vegas and my partner brings this guy to the back with free bagel samples.  He goes on to explain to me how there's no microwaves on site and he uses nothing but the freshest ingredients yada yada and hands me a flier and I read his name on it and I'm like oh shit are you the same Avery Cardoza like the iconic gambling book publisher? He said yes sir.  Funny cause one of his writers is one of my peeps going like 10years back so that was a trip. I knew then that it would be real Brooklyn grub so I kept wanting to go. Even though its just down the road I'm busy as fuck so its hard to sneak away and grab ish.

Fast forward to today.  My partner and I are like are no matter what getting some sammy's down at Gamblers Cafe. We called in an order for pick up.  The girl on the phone was very friendly and accommodating. My partner went to pick up the sandwiches.  I was sitting at the  float center dying of hunger and anticipation to see if the sandwich lived up to Avery's hype.  When she got back we immediately began to tear open our sandwich paper.  The first thing she noticed was that they put two stickers on there in case you only want to eat half your sandwich and wrap the other for later.  How efffing thoughtfull!!  We both got the Loaded Dice. which consisted of the dopest flavor of turkey and ham sliced thin but piled HIGH with bacon and fixings. My partner is a bacon FREAK and she gave the bacon an enthusiastic two thumbs up. We both got all the fixins and the colorful staff did a great job of balancing the amount of fixings for the sandwich. She didnt want the ham so she asked for extra turkey.  Of course we compared our amounts of meat just see if they didnt skimp on the substitution.  Gamblers Cafe passed that test! Both sandwiches were piled equally high. The best of the sandwich was of course the Italian style bread!!!  Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside....LEGIT!!  I told myself I was only going to eat half but hell no i macked down the entire thing it was so delicious!! The Brooklyn style pickle on the side was like icing on the cake.  We will fosho be back to Gambler's Cafe and cant wait to try their breakfast and other REAL FOOD!"	5	Gamblers Cafe	4
I used to love the Grand Lux Cafe here at The Venetian but the service by staff and quality of food have certainly declined.  One of the best things about GLC is that it is open 24hrs, but the last three times I've visited late night they've all been disappointing experience.  Maybe it's because I'm used too excellence when dining here, but they just don't seem like what they used to be.  The wait time was much longer than what I was told and there were forgotten items and modifications made to my meal.  On top of that, a plate that I always order here was not served to it's potential.  The chicken that night tasted absolutely plain.  It's going to be a while before my next Grand Lux meal	2	Grand Lux Cafe	4
The food here was surprisingly decent. After a week of disappointing crusine that cost an arm and a leg (and this from a New Yorker), it was refreshing to find a place where you get what you paid for. The tenders were nice and crispy but in terms of flavor kindof bland compared to Popeye's chicken. You definitely need sauce with these. The place looked clean and the staff is helpful. Good place after a long day and a week of paying for expensive food that isn't worth it	4	Original Chicken Tender	4
Cockroach IN food. Disgusting. They comped meal,  but it wasn't worth it. I'm feeling queasy!	1	Thai House	3.5
"Food was reasonably priced and service was excellent Christine was very attentive and friendly.

For such a busy day (Mother's Day in Mexico, May 10th) we were seated very promptly and did not feel rushed to finish eating.

My one complaint us the lack of Boysenberry syrup, that they used to provide."	5	IHOP	2.5
"Serviceable food, comparable to a decent ""roach coach"".
Hot dogs are pretty good (better than Pink's on the Strip though) but not bun length, chili was o.k. but lacks in comparison to Original Tommy's and even Stagg's canned chili.
The fries were bog standard for a diner so nothing overly special.
Overall decent food at a reasonable price but nothing to write home about or go out of your way for."	3	American Coney Island Chili Dogs	3.5
Excellent fresh fare at the salad bar. Probably my most bitter salad -  mixed dark greens and spinach with Bleu Cheese crumbles and dressing, plus some Kalamita olives - all balanced by the 1\/2 sweet tea 1\/2 black currant tea.	5	Jason's Deli	4
Great food! You can judge a Mexican restaurant by its chips and salsa and these were on point!! Lovely atmosphere on the casino floor but tables are far enough away that you don't feel like you're eating in a casino. Would definitely go back!	5	Javier's	4
This place was delicious. Truly inspired menu with such great flavors. Would recommend to anyone looking for great food around the Venetian.	5	SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill - Las Vegas	4.5
The food was very good! The tenderloin was cooked perfectly, so tender, and the sauce was amazing as well. Make sure to get tagliata style. The pasta in a jar was also delicious. The texture of the pasta was great and it was interesting how it was shaped. The branzino was also superb, maybe a tad bland but it was cooked very well and was very tender. Jose was very attentive and was a pleasure. He did an excellent job! I will certainly be back.	5	Veranda	4
First off i just want to thank the restaurant  team again for the consistent, fast, efficient and  friendly service provided during my visit.  The decor transported me to a calm and serene inner quiet vibe that only got better throughout the night.  I ordered the pork pork rib yellow curry, the crab fried rice, and the calamari. All three fantastic choices.  When I tell you I've never found hapiness in a bowl until i had the first spoon full of this curry!!!  I'm not exaggerating!  Not to mention the prices here are phenomenal!!!  I cant wait to come back.  This is a must have.  If you're  a food lover do yourself a favor and try this restaurant! This was an unforgettable  experience.	5	Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert	4.5
Love this place!  Fast and friendly service is just the beginning.  The food is fantastic!	5	Culinary Dropout	4
Total redemption from the management team at Firefly.  Thank you Tabitha for reaching out.  Last night was no less than perfect service from Irina and staff.  I also tried the beet salad and the lamb chops with lentils which by the way is now one of my favorite dishes.  Thank you again for providing a great atmosphere and delicious dishes!	5	Firefly	4.5
First time here and the girl at the register is a sweet heart!  Thanks for a great experience everyone was amazing.  Now the food is out of this world. Fresh and clean eating at its best.  So refreshing I'll be back!	5	AmeriBrunch Cafe	4.5

"I can't say how much I love in-n-out, not just for their food but for being a leader in their industry. I actually love Dairy Queen but every time I go there the order is wrong and the employees are not trained well. So I stopped going. But I have never had an issue with in-n-out. The employees repeat their order to you at least 3 times so they haven't made a mistake with my order yet. They seem more positive and upbeat at their jobs. I hear that the pay is decent or at least higher than at other fast food joints, I think that helps employees have pride in their jobs when they feel they are being taken care of. When you feel like you're not compensated properly it reflects in your overall view of your workplace and, unfortunately, that will be passed onto the customers. 

People will come back when they have a positive experience and you might lose them for good if they have one bad experience. In-n-out, at least this location, is doing a wonderful job and I will continue to be a loyal customer."	5	In-N-Out Burger	4
"My husband and I had pizza and brownies last night and I woke up feeling not so good. I used to live in San Diego and acai bowls were everywhere. Not the case in Vegas. I had to drive 25 minutes to get to bowlology which I found on an article posted on Facebook about healthy places to eat in Vegas. 

I ordered the Hula bowl, it was delicious and I felt great. It was 8.10 with tax for the regular size. Maybe it was a little more expensive then when I lived in San Diego but worth every penny.

I hope they open a location closer to me. I'm in southern highlands. I ordered one to go for tomorrow but now sure how it will hold up, this is the kind of food to be eaten when you buy it. 

I had to wait a few minutes for the second one I ordered and they gave me a couple of coupons for a free ones for my wait. I will definitely go back whether or not they did that but it was nice that they did do that anyway."	5	Bowlology	4
"This review is for dinner.  I had a great time.  I made reservations and alas I was running a few minutes late.  The host was very welcoming and sited my guest and I.  Our waiter was Jason and he was fab.  I went as part of the Buffet thing and this was our last meal.  I wish that we had made it our first.  The waiter was very attentive in getting our drinks.  I asked for two drinks a lemonade and Mountain Dew - done.  Now onto the food.  I was stuffed by the time that I walked out of there.  There was so much food - but soo little space in my belly.  The tri trips, suasiages, chicken, etc.  The prime rib was great.  I evern saw them put on whole legs on the fire and start to cook.  Now the seafood - crab sticks, mussels, etc was great.  I had the Salmon and it was done great.  I wanted to eat more but I was stuffed.  The crepes with the whipped cream.  The cook had to use a spoon to get it out of the bowl.  The crepes were done to perfection and crepe was not precooked like at Planet Hollywood.  It was like I had gone to heaven.  I ended up with two crepes and that was enough.  Now the Creme Burle,,,it was great.     People may complain that the buffet has gone down over the years.  For me it was great.  It was well worth going.  

They have food from different parts of france and the scenery made it even better.  Sometimes it is the small things that matter - a waiter to bring you your drinks, good food, and then the deserts...no more needs to be said.  Just go.  Again, jason was wonderful and I hope that he gets a raise soon."	5	Le Village Buffet	3
I am unsure what negatives are saying. Great place. GORGEOUS... Unbelievably nice people work here. Management is amazing and very involved. Really worth trying...	5	Pancho's	3.5
This place is still as great as I remember from back in 2012. Oliver is still as amicable and gracious as ever. And thankfully they still sale the best ginger ale ever!	5	Baguette Cafe	4.5
"This place is my new obsession.  There go my hopes of dropping weight before the new year.  It started when I just wanted to grab a quick cup of coffee without having to go all the way to Starbucks.  I live in walking distance of this spot so it was very convenient.  While waiting to get my drink, I watched as the guy ahead of me ordered a strawberry-filled crepe that looked and smelled delicious.  My olfactory sense made a mental note and I knew I'd have to make a return trip.  I ended up never even getting a crepe but tried a personal-sized Fuji Apple Pie instead. Lemme tell you when I say, I'm literally a slave to them now.  I find it very hard to resist swerving into the shopping center to check in to Suzuya to see if that wonderful pastry delight is sitting there calling me like a Siren to indulge in its culinary wonderment.

In the last two weeks or so, I've had about 3 or 4.  I even ordered a full-sized one for Thanksgiving and literally prayed that no one would touch it before the night was over.  THANKFULLY, my prayers were answered and I was able to devour the pie all by myself over a course of a few days since Thanks.  (Try it with butter pecan ice cream and you'll be in heaven!)  I just recently tried the Pumpkin Pie and now I'm torn between which is my fave...so I just buy them both. :) 

The folks that work at Suzuya are sweet, polite and incredibly gracious providing the kind of hospitality that you only get overseas.  Just going inside, I'm transported to a place and world I've never been to but would now love to visit--Japan!  I count myself a a proud patron of this establishment and wish them all the success in the world.  I'm contemplating stopping by even as I type this... :::grabs keys:::"	5	SUZUYA Pastries & Crepes	4.5
"Tried this place out since it was close by and had late hours. I've only had this new sushi burrito thing once before and it was decent. I like the idea of being able to instantly fulfill a sushi craving on the go without having to sit down with chopsticks at a bar or table. So I was immediately drawn to this concept. 

The first place I tried was okay but nothing memorable. So glad I gave Teds a try. I had the #2 Ted's Unagi... I was a bit puzzled about what toppings to add but ending up adding seaweed salad, cucumbers and ginger to the spicy crab and BBQ eel. It was so delish I wished I ordered another.  Service was a bit slow because there were so many in person and online orders ahead of me but they were playing good tunes over the soundsystem (90s Hip-hop and R&B) while I waited so that was enjoyable. 

The thing is...I know I'll be an obsessive regular now because I love sushi so much especially on hot days. And we have quite a few of those in Las Vegas.  I can't wait to bring out of town guests to try out this local phenomenon--sushi burritos-- but only at Ted's!"	4	Ted's Sushi Burrito	4.5
Food was ok.  The kabobs were dry and hard.  Rice was great. Chicken was great.  Service was great.   We did go very late at night so I'm thinking during their busy time it's better food.   50 bucks for 2 people.  Keep that in mind.	3	Kabob N More	3.5
"I have heard good things about this. But wow. No. It wasn't good and wasn't worth it.  Chicken was so dry had to spit it out.  The steak was ok.  

The Latin food.  No. The tortillas were crap. The rice seemed like it was from a Mexican rice box.   The Asian food was good. 

Crab legs you really can't go wrong.

Ribs had no meat on them. 

And the deserts were ok. But really not worth the 41 bucks.  Sad. I was really expecting more.  Our whole party was really disappointed.  Never again"	1	The Buffet at ARIA	3
The food was ok.  But the service is excellent.  Everything was a bit greasy and there is only 1 person working at a time.  I would not come back unless I was forced to eat it again.	2	Abuela's Tacos	4.5
"I tried this place out 3 times, but only because I was working across the street.  

1 Star Because the food is EXCELLENT - I tried there BBQ Rib lunch special and it was amazing.  There Egg Noodle Soup is also very very good.  The duck noodle soup is good also.  The food is not super high quality but they make it work.

1 Star Because the service is very good and nice.  They know every person that comes in by first name and provide a friendly atmosphere

1 Star Because the Thai Tea is very good.  Any that restaurant for me should have excellent Thai Tea.  The portion is a bit small but standard.

1 Star Because the parking is easy and the spot is big enough to fit everyone and you are seated immediately.

-1 Star due to the food taking a very long time.  A lunch is 1 hour standard for most people.  I work across the street and cannot get my food in time.  It takes at least 40 min for the food to come out and i made it back late to work.  every time.  I even left early to go eat at panna thai and i was still late.  One time, every single person in the restaurant did not have food.

Total: 3 Stars = Eat on weekends and nighttime if you are local.  Not a place to drive far to eat or if you are rushed on time."	3	Panna Thai Restaurant	4
I'm here again. And once again this place rocks. I love how it's always consistent with great service and updated music. The food is great and the alcohol is awesome. Once again five stars	5	Karaoke Q Studio	4.5
"Tried this place on late night on a weekday.
I was trying to make a list of the things that would fast good since the menu has like 1000000 things.  I was very very happy with every dish that i ordered.
The beed tongue and Pork cheek skewers were amazing.  I actually went back the next day just to order the Uni Pasta again.  That plate melts in your mouth and is absolutely 100% one of the best dishes I have ever had.  
I highly recommend this place. All dishes are made fast and the quality is very high."	5	Izakaya Go	4.5
Wow! What a great place to eat. Gives iHop a run for its money any day of the week. The babystack pancakes are to die for!  Everything on the menu looked and sounded delicious. After minutes of decision making I went with the country fried steak with the upgrade and the hazelnut pancakes. I left happy with a full belly. Would be coming back soon to try the rest of their pancakes. Please open up a chain in San Antonio!!	5	BabyStacks Cafe	4
"Certainly not as good as the one in San Diego. The sage fried chicken was very good. The bloody maria was exactly what I needed. 

What I specifically don't like is that it is in Imperial Palace. There are no windows, give it a basement-y feel event though the place is large and bright. 

Really, i insisted that my husband and I share, but he wanted his own. Anything is enough for 2 people and if you don't have a refrigerator or microwave in your hotel you wont take this to go so just share."	4	Hash House A Go Go	4
Ana was rude as we were checking out. This place could be much better if they were pleasant. However the food was good if you can deal with marginal service at best.	1	La Creperie	3.5
Although the employees are kind, this place is a mess. Poor location and ridiculously expensive. They didn't even have fish and chips on their menu. I think the man himself needs to clean this place up.	2	Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill	3.5
As usual the food is pretty hard to mess up. It is Costco afterall. But the service is horrible and I think it makes the food taste bad too. They could use some time and stress management training for their team.	2	Costco Food Court	4
Good food and great service. Portions were surprisingly large and wonton soup was great.	4	China One - West Charleston	3.5
"I normally dont care that much but this place was a terrible experience for me and the other table's around me. The service is bad, there are pleny of employees walking around. The guy directing everyone did nothing but tell the other people where to sit customers coming in meanwhile everyone is sitting and waiting for water or any attention at all from a server. 

The servers use some tablet thing to put in the orders so placing your order takes extremely to long. The funny thing is the food came out extermly fast which suggest its not all thay fresh. All in all I,think this place is porrly managed, i could tell my server was doing all he could but not getting the support from management or the resource needed."	2	Sugar Factory	3.5

Lets just say you get what you pay for.  The hotel and room was clean but that's about it.  The room needs a lot of TLC.  Bathroom sink has a large crack as well as the bathroom floor tiles were also cracked.  I booked a strip view room and got a pool view.  I was only stay a short time so figured no big deal.  Wrong, the pool noise level was stupid loud and not a single person poolside?  Anyway, the service was good but the food was not.  Hung out Sunday to watch the game in the sports bar.  it was full with people and 1 poor girl working.  Like I said, you get what you pay for and this was $200 cheaper than the other places I was looking at.  Next time I will pay the extra money.	2	Hooters Casino Hotel Las Vegas	2.5
"Blackened Chicken Irish Nachos.  They're so delicious that I want to write an ode to them.  I'm sure the rest of the food here is delicious, too, but I'll probably never know.   Nachos made with homemade potato chips?  Brilliant.  

I wish I could give this place ten billion stars.  It's got everything going for it.  An Irish pub that's open 24 hours a day and serves the tastiest nachos to ever pass through my lips?!?!  With video poker at the bar?  It can't get any better, right?  

Wrong.  It can.  It's also a NY Jets bar.  I love that more than I love the nachos.  

I'm packing up my car and moving to Las Vegas."	5	McMullan's Irish Pub	4
"This place catered for a work conference. Buffet style lunch. One day Italian and the other day Mexican. I thought it was pretty good. Much better than to be expected. the reviews on this place aren't great and I couldn't speak about the regular meal service. However, everything I had in the buffet lunch was really good, cooked wall and lots of flavor. The Mexican lunch was a little on the salty side but hey what isn't salty in Las Vegas? 

Service was good, just busing but the were prompt about everything."	4	Phil's Italian Steak House	3
"I had the lamb chops in a balsamic Serrano chili reduction sauce. The chose I ordered medium rare. The plate was saturated in this sauce which was incredibly over powering, too vinegary and really needed to reduce longer or use a better quality balsamic. I had this taste in my mouth for days. It was edible but I don't feel was executed properly and for the cost I would expect that. When i told the waiter he said it's not for everyone. I explained that the issue was the vinegar was over powering and if it was properly done it should be more sweet than vinegar. The lamb chops were a little over done cooked medium well-ish and were and effort to cut. The tamale served with it was underwhelming at best. 

My friend had the ciopinno, and it was phenomenal.. I was very  very jealous of his dish and he was lovely to share with me. The flavor of the broth was sensational, I could drink the broth. The seafood was quality.

We had the hibiscus margaritas, which I loved! 

The bread served at the beginning was interesting. Some I liked more than others. the jalapeno corn bread I felt just had a weird flavor, and the taste of baking soda was intense. My husband didn't seem to notice. 

The ambiance definitely leaves something to be desires. I feel more as if i am in some high ceiling-ed cafeteria with table cloths. It's not romantic or special, more of a cattle call. I think the design could have lent a little more to the intimacy and experience of enjoying the food. Again, for the price I have had better for less. 

Based on my experience and for the cost this place, I would say I expected more.  The Ciopinno is what saved my experience. I might try this place again if I was with a group or person who insisted on going but would not get the lamb, and most likely wouldn't seek it out again."	3	Mesa Grill	4
"I don't even know what to make of south american influenced sushi but why the f**ck not. this place is worth try, better than throwing your money at gambling (don't kill me ghosts of Las Vegas' Past)

 I felt I could have shoved a few sushi rolls up my butt to get some attention in this place but whatevers. I liked what I had, but seriously you better be dipping my sushi in some beluga caviar to justify these prices. All I'm saying is, why is every place is Las Vegas so dingy? The cleanliness of some of these places is really atrocious. I just expect a little less worn in place for the price is all i'm saying."	4	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
"I dream of this place sometimes at night, shamefully I devour each delicious bite of a  wagyu brgur with truffle sauce and frois gras. I know frois gois if evil, horrendous, etc etc, but is is sooo delicious. Crispy outside pink in the middle with a matching ground juicy burger below it. I could literally drink the truffle sauce, it's a-mazing. Even if you just dip your fries in it, just do not come here without ordering it. 

I ate the whole thing, on my own and stuffed to the gills I wanted more. I love the atmosphere, the service and I prefer to sit at the bar... hence burger bar, but if you must table it then you must table it."	5	Burger Bar	4
"This place is great. Cantonese style chinese food. Really good. I just needed some vegetables in me and something that wasn't a gut bomb. After 4 days in Vegas you can start feeling a little lethargic from all the booze and fat and carbs, that you begin to crave a fresh salad or some simple chicken and vegetables. 

The wonton soup was EXACTLY what I needed. I walked here easy from Treasure Island. It's kinda funny to find, you have to walk through the bar. It was seriously the coolest things ever. I think it goes something like this:

Two hungry tourists walk into a bar looking for Chinese food. The townies, and burnt out regulars hunched over their drinks hardly look at you as you walk around like a dizzy cheerleader ""like where do I go for the Chinese food?""

Service was fast. Prices were cheap. Ambiance was nil. I would most pleasurably go back."	4	Diamond Chinese Restaurant	4
I don't normally write reviews but we had a bad experience here. First of all they were out of mc chickens which I don't mind but the thing that made me mad was the lady at the window was so rude. She handed us our food then shut the window we then waited for her to open it up to ask for sauce she gave us attitude and only handed us one. We then said thank you and she didn't say anything just shut the window. We then drove off and once we got to the freeway we realized all of our food wasn't there we had items missing that we ordered, plus one of our sandwiches we asked to get it plain and it was full of lettuce . So we turned  around drove back went inside, there was a long line so we went to the front and the lady then told us we had to wait in line. Why should we wait in line when they messed up our order and we had already waited once in line. Just overall im not happy with them and I won't be back.	1	McDonald's	1.5
The Bellagio buffet has gone down hill.  The food quality and variety was ok.  The service was slow.  It used to be much better several years ago.  The empoyees looked unhappy, and unethusiastic.  It showed in the way they worked and dealt with customers.  I won't be going back anytime soon.	2	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
"Simply the best baked goods.
It is a must stop when I am in Vegas.
I will bring back some pastries for the family.

the rasberry beignets-the ultimate form of the jelly donut.
the macarons-perfect texture.
the chocolate bouchons- moist and chocolatey.
the ham and cheese baguettes- perfect balance of ham, cheese."	5	Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian Casino	4
Great atmosphere with a fantastic music set list. Top notch service, compliments to Edgar and others!  Plentiful portions, well seasoned food, tender and delicious steaks.  Silverware and fake candle were not consistent with this high end restaurant. Definitely worth going!	4	Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak	4
"Sad to say, but what I enjoyed the most, excluding our company, was the restaurant's music play list. Food was good, far from great, small plates and high prices. 
I expect higher prices in LV, but this was ridiculous for what is offered. I see no reason to return."	2	Giada	3.5
"Best breakfast we have had in Vegas. Service was excellent - Carlos was our server. He catered to everyone (8 of us) and made sure everything was perfect. 

Kids' breakfasts - lots of food for the price. Our kids enjoyed everything.  The pancakes are pure perfection.  Taste is a cross between a pancake batter and cake. Warm syrup to top them with. 

Adults had a make your own omelette- ham, bell pepper, onion with Bite hash browns (delicious); chocolate chip pancakes; Addiction was their version of eggs Benedict with a great tasting hollandaise sauce. The bacon and sausage had a great flavor. 

This place is worth the drive from downtown.  We will definitely be back."	5	Bite Breakfast & Lunch	4.5
The food taste is fine but the service is horrible. The waiters tools forever between order and order. I get the endless shrimp and took fifteen minutes to refill my plate. I order a beer. Took almost ten minutes to bring it. Never more!	2	Red Lobster	3
It's hard to fine Cuban food in Vegas with authenticity. Definitely this is the right spot. Roasted Pork and Cuban Tamales has the real taste. Simply love it! Only thing they need to improve is supply. This is not Cuba! You can't running a business with shortage. If you ask for something in the menu should be there	4	El Tinajon Cuban Food	3.5
If you want enjoy a hand made tossed pizza this is the place. I'm a fan of pizzas and this one are so great. One of my favorites!!	5	Manhattan Pizza IV	3
"Just recently moved to Las Vegas.  Painted Desert is now my home course.  While its shorter than many golf courses, tight fairways, difficult bunkers and lightning fast greens make it challenging nonetheless.  Painted Desert is a classic ""target golf"" type course.

Course management is at a premium.  If you just like to rare back and whale away for distance, you'll find yourself in trouble more often than not.  Many times a considerably shorter drive will place you in a better position to make the green in regulation.

Oh, those greens.  Fast, fast, FAST.  On top of that they undulate in unexpected ways.  On some holes (notably the 7th) an unforgiving pin placement and a ""too long"" putt will find your ball in the water hazard.  (P.S. Try not to hit the ""coot herd"" on the 7th in the winter)

Overall, playing Painted Desert is an enjoyable outing from check in to the 19th hole, the staff is friendly, accommodating, professional and dedicated to giving you MUCH more bang for your golfing buck."	4	Painted Desert Golf Club	3
"Cheap good eats abound. A simple bacon and eggs had six strips of crispy bacon, two large prices of toast three eggs as what looked like around two cups of home fries. 

Really things were perfect as I was a little more than satisfied borderline full from a $6 breakfast item.

Really the only way to get this review to a five was to have better atmosphere. I wouldn't want to pay for a better atmosphere so the score is about the food and service."	4	Ellis Island Hotel, Casino & Brewery	4
By far some of the best Thai food I have ever had.  Had the prawns and crispy duck panan...just because it was recommended ... well worth it. Expensive but good....I have to say the service was stellar! I would definitely return when in Vegas.	5	Lotus of Siam	4
"I have been eating pizza for a fairly long time. I make my own pizza dough and use fresh toppings. So what I am saying is, I know food. You didn't want a review from a pizza hut expert, did you? Anyway, I have had two pizzas from here (same vacation!) and they were both excellent.

The Brooklyn Bridge is an awesome pizza. I never thought of putting ricotta on a pizza before. Also almost nobody make a proper caprese salad any more. It was served to me, the proper way. No dried oregano, no balsamic drizzle, just cheese, tomato and fresh basil leaf.

If you haven't tried pizza here, don't be discouraged that it is a ""chain"", you'd just be doing yourself a disservice."	5	Grimaldi's Pizzeria	4
Either they use stale beans or the machine is not set up properly. Whatever you do, DO NOT think of ordering an espresso from here, you'll get nothing but a shot of coffee WITH grounds in the bottom of the glass. I will blame the owner for the staff not being able to pull a decent shot.	1	Red Velvet Café	3.5
"We kept hearing about Babycakes from our friends that live out around Summerlin or Lower Utah area LOL and because of the distance we put them off. But, we were around the area running errands and found some time to see what everyone was hooting and hollering about. I'm glad we did.

We walked in around 11:30 and it was semi crowded. We got seated quickly and service was quick. Right away someone took our drink order and also brought our daughter a kids menu and crayons (that was very important). My daughter also noticed the decor, especially the 2 huge butterflies on each side of the beautiful flat screen that was on ESPN. I really liked that decor...not the butterflies but the ESPN. They also put up the kids Babycakes menu colorings all around the restaurants. You can also see the cooking area, it is small but they churn out ONO grindz!

This was our 1st time but we've heard enough through our friends and  Yelpizzles on what we should try. My wife ordered the Cowboy omelette which was pretty big and ordered their new Rock Road Pancakes. I ordered the Kalua Pig benedict.

~RR pancakes. Our kids loved it and what kid wouldn't. The chocolate pancakes were fluffy and loaded with mini marshmallows, choco syrup, slivered almonds, and topped with whipped cream. They also have other pancakes which you can get in full or short stacks. ( we'll try these next time)
-Red Velvet
-S'Mores
-PB & Jelly
-Lemon Ricotta
-Carrot Cake
-Bacon Pancakes
-Whole Wheat

~Cowboy omelette-  For $9.95 she got good size 4 egg omelette with ham, peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese. And you can get either toast or get 3 buttermilk pancakes. You can also upgrade the pancakes to any of the above.

~Kalua Pig Benedict was really good. I've had this before at other restaurants and they get thumbs down, but Babycakes does it right. The Kalua Pig-shredded pork has a nice smokey flavor and not too salty is served on a toasted English muffin, topped w poached eggs, and a nice hollandaise sauce (they don't slather it on...It was just on the eggs). They also put a bit of sauteed cabbage on the tender Kalua pig which added a nice crunch. You might think to yourself ""Why cabbage?"" In Hawaii we grew up eating a dish called Kalua Pig and Cabbage, it was an easy and delicious home cooked meal. This a favorite in my book.

I saw the person next to me order the Loco Moco and i wanted to reach over and snake a bite from him. But, my wife said don't do it. This will be my next choice.

Babycakes is worth the drive and the wait. We've been here once and it won't be our last. But, we do have a message to Babycakes owners....Babycakes please make your way to GVR area...PLEASE!! 

A Hui Ho"	5	BabyStacks Cafe	4
"Mahalos to Island Flavor for coming to the 9th island and sharing what good Local food is all about. Island Flavor does local food right...Thank God!!!

If you have a craving for local food this is the go to place in Las Vegas. Its a sit down restaurant but they also have counter service. The place is clean, everyone is always friendly. and the food is ONO!

Not many Hawaiian restaurants in the mainland make me feel like i'm back at home but Island Flavors does exactly that every single time. I've tried a lot of their menu but my favorites are:

1. Love their Oxtail stew- Its ONO period.
2. Any of their Loco Moco's- hard to finish off its a mountain.
3. They got good poke...best on Fri\/Sat when fish comes in
4. Pocho Bean soup...very good, almost like my Aunty's-almost
5. Roast Pork...melt in your mouth! 
6. and of course their hand wrapped Laulau's- I think its served only on Aloha Friday. Its a good thing they only serve it on Fri or I would have to buy new pants.
7. Their mixed plate is like the Zip pac on steroids! So much food...and much better.

This place is a winner in my book. They would put a lot of local restaurants in Hawaii to shame. What are you waiting for? Stop Yelping for a minute and drive your okole to Island Flavors. And don't forget to bring your appetite because they pile it on. Trust me, you'll be taking food home unless you are sharing your plate with 2 other people.

Aloha to you too!"	5	Island Flavor	4.5
"Monta is definitely one of the better ramen shops in Las Vegas. Its in the same strip mall as Raku on Decatur\/ Spring Mtn. 

Monta reminds us of Japan's ramen shops...its all about order your food, eat your food, and get out, so the next group can eat. It's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables\/ seats. The restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.

The menu is simple. Miso, Tonkatsu, or Shoyu ramen. My favorite is...all of them. Huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  I seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. They give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, green onions, half boiled egg, and kikurage. Its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.

Another favorite is their pork belly bowl. Its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. You get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. Its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. We always get a small bowl and share it.

Their gyoza is good as is the kim chee fried rice. We need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that Monta is known for.

Its easy to over order food at Monta. Because the ramen bowls are big...resist ordering other dishes unless you have a big party and you want to share. 

Monta is great on a hot day and better on a cold day!! 

Arooha!!!!!"	4	Monta Ramen	4
Amazing tasting of appetizers, cocktails, chicken & red velvet waffles with a twist and a unique carrot cake desert to top it off. Great new DTLV restaurant. Walking distance from the Container Park. A fresh look for Downtown with good lighting and high ceilings. The private loft on the 2nd floor gives it a VIP feel that's perfect for a group or larger party. The bar is comfortable with a wide variety of drinks including a few frozen cocktails - try the frozen mango sangria, spa looking with fresh fruit garnish- refreshing and smooth. Lots of parking near by and tons of foot traffic around.	4	Therapy	4
Happened to be here during restaurant week - they had a set menu option - the food was fabulous - only one Pinot noir option by the glass but it was excellent. All around one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Also, the Four Seasons is an oasis of sanity in the world of Vegas - very relaxing meal and great service. Thinking about eating here every night ...	5	Veranda	4
"We had a small intimate wedding in Vegas on 8\/20\/11 and decided to have our reception at Pampas. We had planned this about 6 months in advance with their event coordinator, Jasmine. She was very helpful. 

The day of the reception, everything went smooth and we were very impressed. The decorations were done well, and our wedding cake was made in-house and it was a 3-tier cake and was huge. We were very impressed with the cake. We had eaten here previously so we already knew how the food was, but our guests praised them. We had about 60 people. 

All in all our reception was done well and I would not hesitate to eat here again or use them for a family gathering\/event."	5	Pampas Churrascaria Brazilian Grille	3
I've been to better. The best part are the crab legs. Other than that, its like any other buffet. A little pricey to be like any other buffet. For the price, go to wicked spoons at cosmo.	3	Le Village Buffet	3
"Me and my wife wanted to see what all the hype was about so we went at 5pm on a Sunday. It actually doesn't open for dinner until 5pm daily and there was no line and was not busy at all, however not sure how Friday and Saturdays are.

Food was excellent and presentation was very unique. Most of dishes are served in mini dishes to proportion them out which is a unique idea. There was wine at the table ($20 extra if you want) and a bottle of water that is filtered on site. So when you want more water, pour yourself. The only buffet that I've been to that served bone marrow....but it was good...lol. It was just an overall excellent experience. I will have to say this is by far the best buffet I've been to in Vegas, with the Wynn and M Resort buffets sitting at second. Although at $35\/person ( a little pricey), I believe Friday and Saturday is a little more, you need to at least experience this once and you may not even think about the price afterwards."	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
I came this place twice. Order the same---Chirashi Bowl！BUT it's A LOT different！The first time I visit, they give really thick cut and 12 piece of Sashimi on a Chirashi bowl！That's why I came second time. But I feel so disappointed this time！The second time is really thin cut and don't have 12 piece. I ask them why is big different and they said："oh because it's made by different chef so it's different" WTF？！！I really don't know what I should say.	1	Tomo Sushi	4.5
Wow. This place is amazing. I've never had such a great cup of coffee and donut in my life. The whole top two rows are vegan, and they sell out QUICK. It's el yummyo.  My favorite was the maple donut and you should all try it. Next time, when your in the area, stop by Ronalds. After all, you can buy about 60 donut holes and spend about 5 dollars. Go RONALDS! :)	5	Ronald's Donuts	4.5

"Really not up to Nobu standards. This is the 3rd Nobu I've visited and each time have had a fantastic meal with excellent service. The food on this trip was largely OK (missing something compared to other Nobu meals but I can't put my finger on it) but the experience and staff were terrible. 

Long story short, after a long standing reservation, we walked into a half empty restaurant and were literally seated at the worst table in the place. After asking to move or find a more comfortable spot at one of the 20+ open tables, we ended up essentially being told no and taking a seat. 

The waiter didn't help much. We're much more into the cooked side of the Nobu menu (they have a lot of non-sashimi and sushi options) and have always found a helpful waiter who guides us the right direction. This waiter had no time or desire to do so.

All and all, certainly not returning to this Nobu nor would I recommend this Nobu as a true Nobu experience. Long story longer, this Nobu also offers room service to the Caesar's hotel. Nobu should focus on quality and not over extending into non-essential business ventures."	2	Nobu	4
Great food! Best kimchi among all in the foodcourt!!! We always eat here! I recommend them!!! :-)	5	Song's Family	3.5
"My Buddha and I read about this place and thought to give it a shot. We waiting in line for maybe 15 minutes and sat at the bar. The bartender Mario was great with us! Offering beer tasting until we found the one we wanted. Suggested great burgers and the truffle fries! I had the Hells Kitchen Burger and haven't had a burger from a restaurant taste so delicious! Cooked to perfection at Medium and the avocado brought out a fresh flavor it. 

The other bartender that was working was rude. A foreign couple came and sat next to us at the bar. They were order drinks and there was a language barrier, but the bartender had no patience! He brought them the wrong drinks then got upset with them because he didn't understand them when myself and Buddy knew exactly what they wanted. 

Overall I highly suggest you go here! Great food at great price!!"	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
They say they have a few of the fountains, but the trees block most of it. The beer is expensive and you can't get a flight. Service was okay but there was no one in the place while I was there so hard to completely rate them. If you are looking to try beer go to beerhaus	2	Beer Park	3.5
Great place to grab a brew! Food is subpar. Staff was really friendly and was able to have a couple flights! Great spot to get craft brews on the strip!!	4	Beerhaus	4
"Not fusion. Not affordable. Not creative.

I could have done better myself for a fraction of the cost with better ambiance in my hotel room at NY-NY.

Mediocre service was the icing on the cake. (no water, no silverware... Until the tortilla line cook noticed we were just sitting there debating whether or not to use the dessert spoons left at our place settings -- not too handy for a meal mostly consisting or romaine lettuce.). I'm not Paris Hilton, but paying $50 for less than 750 calories is ridiculous. 

Otherwise the food was tasty given that we had no expectations of Jose Andres."	2	China Poblano	3.5
"I had the champagne brunch. The wait is 1.5 hours. They have a great variety of food but no king crab legs (They have it during dinner). The ceviche is pretty good, the omelet is only so-so while both meat at the carving station is good. The spring roll, Shu-mai and sushi rolls are nothing special - as one would expect from a buffet.

In conclusion that is a decent buffet, the price is higher than the average buffet but that is compensated by 
located in Wynn
Large variety"	3	The Buffet	3.5
"I went to L'aterlier de Joel Robuchon two years ago for the first time. That is the meal of my life. Last week I went there again to try the tasting menu. While I am satisfied with the meal, I didn't wow me the same way it did two years ago. Over the 9 course tasting menu, I found that the lobster soup is the best (very creative), the John Dory is nothing special, and scallop is way too salty while everything else is above average. 

Overall, this is a very good restaurant if it is located elsewhere. But with all the choices in vegas, I probably would like to try something else next time."	4	L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon	4.5
I went there for the happy hour (4-6pm). Everything is appetizer sized (except for rolls) and they are dirt cheap (equal or less than $5). My companion and I share 3 orders of sake, 7 dishes and 1 roll and the whole meal is less than $50. Great  for a meal, especially you lose your shirt in vegas. :)	4	Sushi Roku	4
I am so glad I finally got to experience the old more iconic side of Vegas this weekend.  This place is totally excellent.  Today with all the new Vega$ sometimes it is great to go back to the start.  I visited both the Lounge and restaurant.  The late night food was simple and good, which certainly helped after cocktails. If you like the idea of the old Vegas with, Elvis, & Rat Pack days, then you should stop in for a drink or bite and experience a true treasure. Cheers!	5	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
Food is trash. Got a combo pizza, side salad & Stromboli. Pizza was bland, barely any flavor, undercooked. Stromboli was the same no flavor, outside was done but inside the cheese wasn't melted & center was cold. Saved the side salad for lunch but not expecting much at all.	1	Sicily's Pizza	2
After searching for dog friendly restaurants in the area I am very pleased to have found the Grapevine Cafe. It was the end of a long, busy vacation and was looking for something with a more relaxed atmosphere that we could all just enjoy good food and conversation. The ambiance filled that expectation of a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere. The patio was spacious and inviting for all of us including the dog. The staff was attentive, friendly and never made is feel rushed. They truly made us feel like guests in their home. We ordered appetizers, salads and pasta, it was all prepared perfectly with small twists on dishes to call them their own. I wish I could get their recipe for their Penne Pasta a la Vodka, it was the best thing I had in a long time and have to thank our waiter Luis for such great recommendations for food\/ wine pairings. We all had a great experience and will definitely come back when in Vegas!!	5	Grape Vine Cafe	4
We love Lazy Dogs! The food is consistently good, very unique atmosphere, friendly staff. I love the mac&cheese, tortilla soup, grilled cheese and tomato soup, trout dinner really anything on the menu. Plus love the patio for taking your dog buddy with you.	5	Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar	4
Very impressed! Great theme. Food was really good. We ordered the calamari for the appetizer. The best I have ever had. We had a great pizza which was a happy hour special. Also, had the shrimp\/grits dish. Everyone was pleased with the food and drinks. The most important part of the meal was the server, Ron. He was not only an excellent server( the best I have seen in a long time) but the way he took a genuine interest in us was amazing. He was so attentive and just made us feel so special. We were all very impressed with this young man.  Ask for him you won't be sorry!	5	Public School 702	3.5
Brandon was a great bartender. Really nice and helpful when deciding on all the beer choices. Loved his recommendations. Def try the young berry chocolate if u want a dessert beer the only reason I'm giving this review 3 starts and not 5 is because being vegetarian its disappointing when u order a gardein pizza and after eating u realize it wasn't vegetarian at all. It def wasn't his fault. Another server had asked if we wanted something else and we should have stuck w the same bartender to begin with.orher than that, next time we go Vegas well def be stopping by to visit Brandon again	3	Yard House	4
Delicious, not one to eat at the "as seen on tv spots", but was frankly impressed here. Burgers are delicious and ingredients are fresh, had a Chicago burger, amazing, from bun to party everything in between was amazing. Great for kids, family atmosphere.	5	Bobby's Burger Palace	4
Excellent food, great service will definitely be our future stop in Vegas. The rib eye was also delicious. Kids had a California roll which exceeded all expectations. All the fish was fresh and delicious.	5	Zuma Las Vegas	4.5
"Five stars on account that my expectations were set very low going into this. The circus circus is well, a circus, however you will be pleasantly impressed by the gem it holds within, this place is dark and quiet and has incredible mesquite grilled steaks, I enjoyed every bite of my New York steak and would definitely try and visit next time.
Thank you for your excellent food and service, and to those who think this place is not worth the money, nothing worthwhile in Vegas is cheap, and cheap things aren't good."	5	THE Steak House	4
"I was in Vegas last weekend and, in my quest for a unique breakfast, stumbled upon this place. First, let me say that this restaurant proudly represents what Vegas stands for. The food is big..Huge... And ultra...  I mean ULTRA tasty. When I draft a review, I comment on 3 areas: Food, service, and price. 

The service was decent... Above average, but not over the top. The servers we experienced were attentive and friendly. Some were rather unique looking but hey, that's Vegas. One thing I liked was that everyone we talked to acted as if they were happy and proud to work there. I like that! The atmosphere was very casual and the place was a bustling with activity. I was happy and comfortable.

The food....WOW...the food.  OK, it took me quite some time to decide what to order.  Everything on the menu looked good!  So did the plates of food I saw passing by!  I ended up ordering the fried chicken benedict...a Man vs. Food favorite.  It did not disappoint.  In one word: Unbelievable.  This place prides themselves on twisted farm food.  The portions were HUGE and the taste was outstanding!  My girl ordered the brown sugar and banana pancake.  It was the size of a medium pizza!  It tasted so good that you would need to sit down to eat it.  This is simply no joke.  My only regret is that I didn't get to try other things on the menu.  If you are in a party of 4, I would highly recommend ordering 3 totally different breakfasts and then sharing them.  This would allow you to try different things and you would in no way be short on food.  This restaurant definitely did deliver in every sense of the word.  BOOYAH!

The price was amazingly reasonable for Vegas.  It was priced similar to IHOP but with all the huge portions and pizazz of a meal you cant get just anywhere.  For the two of us it was 28 dollars with drinks!  We did order too much food though as neither of us could finish.  My taste buds wanted more but my stomach simply couldn't handle another bite!

I just love this place.  I am glad we found it and I cant wait to go back the next time I visit Las Vegas."	5	Hash House A Go Go	4

"So we had reservations for 930 on a Friday night and were seated immediately upon our arrival. The (almost all-male)staff were attentive, informative and friendly. 

Our meal:

-Edamame with shaved seasalt
-Sashimi yellowtail with miso and jalapeno (yummmmy, Bobby's favorite)
-Black cod in lettuce cups with filo flakes (my favorite, so perfect)
-Sashimi with garlic chips (little too salty)
-Salmon sushi
-Toro sushi (very tasty fish)
-Dessert: edamame icecream atop a brownsugar brownie,Caramel sauce, and tiny sliver of decadent brittle...the icecream scoop was so tiny that we really couldn't taste the edamame. 

A super treat for sushi, but be prepared to spend money!!"	5	Nobu	4
"Had reservations on a Saturday night (10\/11\/14) with my wife and her parents. Wanted to sit outside but settled for inside as there was no open outside seating until after 9pm. Good ambiance and a nice setting with the fountains faintly visible in the background.

Food: Menu had many options that looked great and we all ordered something different. Unfortunately, the food was so average to below average that it led me to write a review . The ladies each ordered a flat bread  (Prosciutto and Fig & Spicy Chicken Sausage). They were fine but nothing memorable. Below average dough with some fancy toppings. Father-in-law ordered the special, Braised Short Ribs. It had good flavor but a little on the dry side. Lastly, I ordered the Crazy Mushroom Pappardelle. It was $34. It was an Olive Garden dish that had a bout 4 or 5 mushrooms in it. It even had the ""Signature Dish"" stamp next to it; it was a disappointing signature dish. I'm rarely a harsh critic when it comes to food but the price we paid and the meal we got was disappointing.

So why 3 stars instead of 1 or 2...
The servers, managers and everyone that had to answer a million questions from my mother-in-law. They were so friendly and genuine in their conversations. I am terrible and can't remember their names, but the staff that worked with our table saved the experience."	3	Olives	4

This was our second visit here this week. First visit was dinner, I had the steak which was cooked perfectly, hubby had the pork chop which was also very good.  Today for lunch it is busy but server is very attentive and food was amazing! The price is great for the strip and love the 3 for 10 drinks special . We will be back!	5	Ocean One Bar and Grille	3

We were unsure after reading reviews, but we are so happy we gave it a try!! If you think you are coming to a fancy establishment then don't come! This is a down home diner with amazing food! The shrimp and grits was delicious, the smothered fried chicken with world famous gravy was AMAZING!! We are now aware of why it is world famous!! Our server was great. Will be coming back, maybe tomorrow lol!!	5	M&M Soul Food Cafe	3
Find this on my way home, the portions are huge, I can't finish one lunch special by myself, I had a lunch combo, which is beef with broccoli with fried rice and chow menu noodle. With the lunch combo, you get a 24 oz drink and 2 egg rolls too. The staffs are nice too, they give me the soup too even it says the soup is for dining in only, they let me take it to go. Besides the big portion, the food there are made to order, I can add spicy as the way I like. I will definitely be back.	5	China A GoGo	3
The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries is AWESOME! So much flavor and very filling. My husband and I decided to share a burger because we wanted to try so many appetizers. Nothing was disappointing. The chicken is fried pieces with a dipping sauce (if you are from Hawaii, similar to Mitzuken or Sugoi's). A must try is the the Pork Belly steamed buns. I was craving this on the plane ride home. We had to try the Shogun Burger, a $25.00 burger but it was soooo gooood! It has Foie Gras, Unagi and although that may not sound like it would be good together, it was GREAT!	5	Bachi Burger	4
I tried this place based on other yelp reviews and I am glad I did! In a strip mall just past the Wynn Hotel, it is easily missed as somewhere to try but, stop in and try their food. $2.00 street style taco's so full of meat. We tried the carne asada and the spicy pork, both were so flavorful. We also ordered the carne asada fries, man this could feed a whole family. $10.00 but worth it. You will be sharing. Fresh food, made on the spot. Friendly, friendly service! It is seems to always be busy but the lines move very quickly so don't let the crowd deter you. Everything had so much flavor!	5	Tacos El Gordo	4
We came with a group and there were at least 20 of us. I asked about a specific roll because I am allergic to shrimp and crab. Not only did she double check, she would warn me each time she place a dish down that had either shrimp or crab. With so many people ordering, that was really going above and beyond. The food quality is very good. I was a little nervous going into an AYCE but it was really fresh. Everyone was happy with the food.There was not a bad dish on the table. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Las Vegas. Thank you Island Sushi and Grill!	5	Island Sushi & Grill	4
This was our first time at Hanabi restaurant and we were very disappointed with their services.  Their foods however was very good but we had to wait for a very long time for the foods to arrive,  a little later that evening either the owner or the manager came over to us and showed his concerned to make sure we were okay,  I did tell him that it was unusual to wait so long for the foods.  My son did not get a straw with his drinks.  We were there on Tuesday evening around 7 pm so it was even crowded, and because it took a long time to get out foods,  we didn't get out of there close to 9 pm.  If had their services was great they would have gotten 5 stars.  We will unlikely be going back again.  Since it was my wife's birthday,  they didn't have any candles and yes we know it is not the restaurant's responsibility but it would have been nice if they had candles as well.	3	Hanabi	4

How the heck can you run out of bread as a McDonald's run out of burgers I've never seen such a mismanaged such a ill-fated run shop it's like a tire shop saying we ain't got no tires I understand you may be running out of one item but the bread the main thing on a Saturday night at 7 o'clock they need to fire whoever runs this place and the district manager to because he's not smart enough to go to another store and bring that store some bread	1	Capriotti's Sandwich Shop	4

They're slices are made with fresh ingredients cook perfectly the bartender was sweet,,, excellent great conversation.. a definite stop for a great slice of pizza and a drink great atmosphere and really really clean bathroom kudos for that	5	Evel Pie	4.5
So glad I found this place only right down the street from me. Their prices are a whole lot more reasonable than the competition in the area and they hook it up! If you're looking for a friendly local auto shop this is it!	5	MVR Auto Services	4.5
I came here for a 4 piece meal and I got 3 pieces and this thing on the side. I ordered corn and I got flour. There was no line and I can see why now.	1	El Pollo Loco	2.5
Another Chef Marvin's genius creation. Eating here is like seeing God in the food. The speed and execution is unparalleled. Service is impeccable. Must visit when you are in LV.	5	Echo & Rig	4.5
OMG! You have got to be kidding me! This place is a disgrace. The pizza was a greasy piece of rubber. No flavor what so ever. I hope I don't get sick from the cheesecake. The brownie tasted like stale DIRT! The driver looked like he was homeless and on drugs. HORRIBLE! 1 star because 0 stars isn't an option.	1	Flamingo Pizza	2.5
Surprisingly decently good service and food for 1am. The waitress was super friendly and the food came out in roughly 15 minutes. I ordered The Cafe Surf & Turf which was great, came with green beans and I opted for French Fries.	5	Grand Café	3
"IKEA is IKEA no matter where in the country you go. This one did the job in regards to making the items
I came for available to me. My biggest disappointment here though was absolutely no one being available to help or I should say seen. With how large the store is, we found our selves needing to wait and go to the other end of the floor only to be pointed to return back where we came from, no ""let me show you."" 

Their as is section was a bit of a miss but they have no real control over that.  

Being the only IKEA in the area, I'll have to come back if a need were to prompt me but I have no real desire to return."	3	IKEA	3.5
Always a go to breakfast\/brunch spot for us. Everything I've gotten has been consistently fantastic. And have you tried the banana nut muffins??!	5	Egg Works	4.5
"It's not the best pho I've had, or even good. I'd probably rate it as mediocre pho to be honest, however the service is actually fast and straightforward. I do like the $1 option for extra noodle and I think $3 for extra meat. Prices are also a little higher than I've seen at other pho places, but it's certainly not overpriced or bad.

It's decent for the location since it's very close to the strip in an open strip mall and there is also a big wide area for seating. I didn't try the sandwiches though, but I was in a mood for noodles. Perhaps next time."	3	Pho Thanh Huong	4
"It looks nice from the outside, and definitely tries to be classy and more on the upscale side. Locals come here often, the waitstaff mentions.

The food? Meh. I think my expectations were set high, as it was mostly forgettable in my mind. I only remember the Caprese to be very excellent, though. Through a variety dishes from risotto, steak, osso buco, etc it was not as flavorful and tender as I was expecting.

The experience on the whole was nice though, as I came here for a friend's birthday. I merely asked for dessert and the waiter gave a whole schpeal about how he's risking getting fired to give us a complimentary slice of cake for the birthday girl -- I'm not sure he was telling the truth or not, but I found it more annoying than flattering.

He also called out a roaming magician to perform tricks for our table. I guess is night, but I felt a little invasive.

Um, I guess it was alright."	3	Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar	4
"Great service, great egg dishes. When you order coffee they give you a pot so you don't have to constantly ask for refills. This particular location has more locals so you know it's a decent place to grab breakfast.

Definitely worth a trip out for breakfast if you are an out of towner like I am, or if you are in the area. So many dishes to choose from, that's probably the most annoying part about this place!"	4	Egg & I	4.5
"A girlfriend and I were in Vegas this past May celebrating graduating and Hakkasan made it into our plans both nights we were in town. When we arrived around 11:30 after taking our time to get dolled up, there was a never ending line for people trying to get in. I had some sort of question and ended up approaching one of the managers who ended up escorting us to the front of the line. While that was flattering, I felt horrible for everyone needing to wait in that ridiculous line. Basically the same rules as anywhere else apply here at Hakkasan x10. If you've got a massive group of females - you're entitled and are able to enter immediately. If you're a male, particularly a group of males, you get robbed of all the money you have after you've waited in line for 3 hours. 

I was lucky enough to have been let in and we had a great time time the first night. There was no event going on but the music was spot on to our taste - hip hop\/R&B, throwbacks. Everyone was on the floor having a great time. Drinks were good but expensive as you'd expect, lucky enough to have them bought for me. Then the dreaded happened - my 5 day old phone was stolen out of my purse! We ran to find Hakkasan personnel and happened to be the most unhelpful, unsympathetic beings I've ever met. =( Given the nature of the establishment they must assume everyone they speak to is sloppy drunk, that's the type of attitude I received and was questioned how someone was able to take my phone out of my purse and me not realize it. Seriously? I was incredibly upset and sadly not drunk - the little buzz I had going had completely diminished upon learning my phone was gone. 

We went back the following night after getting on a bottle service list for Lil John. We had a great time, awesome seats and private dance area and unlimited alcohol. 

The lines and their standards really infuriate me along with the way the staff felt it was appropriate to speak to their guests in such a manner. Two stars off for that."	3	Hakkasan Nightclub	2.5
"To be honest I was a bit inebriated while getting to this joint because I was pre-partying during the car ride from LA to LV... however that didn't stop me from eating. After 10pm ""sexy ladies"" eat at a discounted price, but really it's just girls in general. I know I would have rather rolled in my hot outfit, but I guess it was better to embarrass myself in a t-shirt and jeans instead of something I would have regretted spilling something on.

However! I still enjoyed myself and most of the dishes were alright. Fresh oysters were pretty good, a little spicy but still satisfying. Sampled a few different sushi I don't remember what kinds... but it was ok! It's what you would expect from AYCE but a tad better... it's no premium sushi, but for what you get it's not bad at all.

But yes, Vegas is known for the buffets and AYCE, so you can get your belly's worth of sushi here as well! :D"	3	Hikari	4
"I really love this down to earth coffeeshop in Downtown LV a skip away from Fremont Street. The staff and baristas are super friendly and will cater to your needs - there was a vegan couple ahead of me in line in which they modified their orders to fit their dietary needs.

Food is good, and everything is freshly made in house. Coffee is also great and in the evening they serve beer on tap! They also have a section of records, posters, and even an art gallery up front and in the back. They will also occasionally have bands and performers. It really feels like a local joint that has a free, creative, friendly spirit - what you really would expect from Downtown LV, away from the strip.

They also spin records up front as their background music, so great! :)"	4	The Beat Coffeehouse & Records	4
"I was really looking forward to visiting this CPK location as you don't see many chain restaurants on the strip with 4+ star reviews. 

I arrived, was seated and waited on promptly. I ordered the gauc and chips appetizer to start. I've had this before so I thought I knew what to expect. Well they use frozen corn, which is absolutely fine but among your gauc bites you get freezer cold bites of corn. Haven't had it served to me that way before. 

Then I ordered what I really came for, the garlic cream fettuccine. Unfortunately this was also not prepared the way I had expected. There wasn't much of a cream to the sauce at all that the pasta was even sticking to its self while hot. The garlic flavor was very subtle and the sauce itself didn't offer much taste. Regardless I had left overs so I took it to go and needless to say it was impossible to take out of the to go box to heat up because it was all brick solid. 

I did enjoy my drink - strawberry mango cooler, the strong taste of ginger offered quite the kick. I also enjoyed the ambiance. They have a large patio section and equally large interior. They had the game going and The Park had live music so I got the best of both worlds. 

I don't know that I would return for the food. I was pretty disappointed and that's never been the case with CPK, though it was my first time at this location."	2	California Pizza Kitchen	4
"Stayed at the Elara and was looking for a tasty relatively inexpensive place to eat aside from the big names (that suck) on the strip. Yelp came to the rescue and I saw the Nacho Daddy was within the Miracle Mile which is connected to the Elara. It feels like you're exiting the property which you are but when you turn right, the establishment is right there close to - couple yards from the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd. If you sit outside you can hear and see a lot of the hustle of the strip. 

Nachos were really good, I was happy to see all the vegetarian options. I would have liked my nachos to be more cheesy. They were perfectly spiced however and the flavors all melded very well. Huge portions and so two people can easily share. I had a peach margarita along with my meal which was quite strong but good. I was happy with the prospect that I could take it to go as I had an early morning but still wanted to enjoy it back in my room. They had live music while I was there and it was a fun little joint to enjoy when you sort of just want to get away from what is the strip. Will defiantly be back when in Vegas. Not for that scorpion shot though!"	4	Nacho Daddy	4
"Not one star, ZERO stars! This is legitimately the worst Pizza Hut I've ever been to in the history of pizza huts I've been to throughout the country. Why you may ask? Because I called and explained my dad had a flight to catch and that we needed the pizza to be ready upon arrival and that I wanted to dine in, the lady said oh ok no problem come on in and just ask for plates, it'll be 20 minutes. Well we showed up 25 minutes later and I'm told the pizza was just put into the oven, what? So we wait, fine. I ask for a plate, the lady at the register says I can't give you a plate you're not dining in, I say yes we are and I spoke to the person that took my order. She stares at me for a minute as though she can't figure out who would allow such a thing. She hands me two plates after more explanation, one of which is dirty - keep in mind these are paper plates. Then my dad orders a drink and I want water and she states there is no water, bottled water? No, no water. I'm absolutely mind blown.

The location was filthy, the employees have no regard for their job and quite frankly didn't want to work. I'm not sure why they're still open or even a fine in facility if they don't appreciate patrons. I will not be returning and am thankful that this is not my local Pizza Hut location, so I really won't need to return."	1	Pizza Hut	2
Located inside the Venetian in St. Marks square. Average at best. Limited vegetarian options, bland tasting as well. Good wine. Had to ask for necessities - napkins, olive oils, crushed pepper, Parmesan several times. No reason to go back when I'm in Vegas.	3	Canaletto	3.5
Met up with a friend for lunch this afternoon at Margaritaville. I've frequented the one in Chicago but this was my first time trying the Flamingo location. I ordered the loaded nachos - subbed black beans for the meat off the appetizer list and boy were they loaded! They're definitely an appetizer to share - FYI. Service was fast, though there wasn't much checking in. Vegetarian options are limited so I'd much rather go elsewhere but my visiting friends chose Margaritaville. I would come back to try a margarita or two!	4	Margaritaville	3.5
"I can't get enough of Shake Shack! With the incredible food scene in LV, I question why I always want to go there and the answer is the shroom burger, fries and purple cow float. I swear I'm not 10 years old . But seriously, I've never had a better burger! Consistently crispy with the perfect ratio of cheese stuffed into the portobello. Fries are great, piping hot with the perfect amount of salt and I hate salt so I would know. Their self serving condiment area is wonderful so no one can judge the amount of mayo I take. The purple cow float is great, I've been there with several different people and it's not something everyone seems to love, but I really do. 

Opportunities for improvement are the water dispenser at the condiment bar. The water is always lukewarm, which is annoying when you're there in the spring\/summer\/fall. The bathroom could use more tidying up. It's a small space so filth anywhere doesn't do it any justice. It's always littered with paper towels. 

Random FYI - I'm from Chicago where I have a Shake Shack only 20 minutes (out of my way) away but for some reason I never make it out. There's something about the one of the strip that makes me crave it through my entire trip every time I come to Vegas. Hey I'm saving money at least!"	4	Shake Shack	4
Met up a girlfriend at Libre and left wanting a little more. First of all, they close at 10.... yes 10. Which left me alarmed from Vegas standards. We felt a little rushed for that reason. They don't offer any vegetarian tacos and their food all in all was very bland. Definitely wouldn't recommend the gauc. I had the mini tostadas, they were OK but again lacking flavor. They have margaritas for a dollar so that doesn't hurt. I'm not sure I would return necessarily.	2	Libre Mexican Cantina	4
"Delicious, delicious, delicious spin on staple Indian street foods. 

I had a paneer chili taco, masala fries, paani puri and a mango lassi while my friend ordered a chicken chili taco. We both very much enjoyed them. Be warned, they are tiny and addicting, you'll want one more and then one more again! 

Seating is outdoors, the establishment is food truck-esque and they have patio tables to enjoy your food. We weren't there on a very busy day but I imagine it fills up awfully quickly when it is. They're only open until 8pm so plan to show up accordingly. 

What makes it even more special is that two very kind souls, Dharmesh and his wife now own this joint and make everything from scratch. They are a 2 bodied business and work extremely hard to please each and every customer. We were asked multiple times if we enjoyed our food and if we needed anything more. 

I can't wait to return and take my visiting family and friends!"	5	Desi Burrito	4
"I'm learning Vegas surprisingly has quite the Indian food dining scene, which is fantastic to say the least. My family and I were headed back to the strip (our home base) after a long but fun day at the west rim of the Grand Canyon. We knew we wanted Indian but the strip joints couldn't promise a 4-5 star meal. I did a quick search as we got closer and Mint was just a couple minutes away and seemed to have a good track record. 

We arrived and were seated immediately. We were given a good amount of time to review their expansive menu which by the way is filled with more variety than I have ever seen in any Indian restaurant coming from Chicago. A lassi bar, lassi cocktails, various styles of naan, an inferno challenge - living upto the Vegas touch, foods labeled clearly as vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, Jain, etc. We ordered masala papad and sev puri as appetizers to start and both were above average. We felt the sev puri lacked much flavor. For our entrees we did paneer tikka, pineapple schezwan rice, fire roasted garlic naan, kabuli naan and bhatura. The paneer tikka was excellent - full of flavor, as was the naan and bhatura - yum! The rice was far too spicy to eat so I wish we hadn't gotten that and the kabuli naan tastes like desert so I wish I had passed on that because it was odd having to eat it with the paneer tikka. 

Overall we had a great meal and were quite impressed with menu and selections, the ambience was nice and service was quick. There's definitely room for improvement however. I guess some of the busboys don't know English (they don't communicate this to us) so when we would order something with them a waiter would come and ask us again and everyone would be lost as to if someone was getting our order. It would be much simpler if those that don't know English would just grab someone that does or not work the floor. For drinks we saw lychee lassis on the menu and knew we had to have them, so we ordered only to find out they're unavailable along with the tandhai, two of their most unique flavors!!! I was so disappointed to learn this. The owner explained it's because they need someone to bring it from India whenever family or friends go which is hard to rely on, but then I feel the menu is a tease in that way. I feel when it's available they would make a ""specials"" menu for the month and include it on there. In that event I went with a rose lassi which was great, my got a mint lassi because again the uniqueness of flavors. Well that was a mistake. We were thinking mojito like sweetness in a mint lassi - we were very wrong. For those of you that know what the mint ""pain"" in pani puri tastes like, it's that, mixed with yogurt. Absolutely unpleasant in the context of a lassi. Regardless of the mishaps, we had a generally great meal and would definitely consider returning when back in town. Only a 5 minute drive from the strip, well worth it for the quality of food."	4	Mint Indian Bistro	4
"I really wanted to like Thai Pepper but it fell short on a number of accounts. As a vegetarian, there's not a whole lot to choose from. I had fried green beans to start and some vegetarian noodles as my entree along with a Thai iced tea. Well something didn't sit right and within the hour I was in the bathroom. Bummer. Food lacked flavor, it was spicy yes but not flavorful. Ambience is busy, crowd is mixed, the area is a bit sketchy and I'm glad I came in the afternoon. 

Would hesitate to return."	2	Thai Pepper	4
"Yay for Wolfgang Puck being my neighbor! Their happy hours are great. The ambiance is nice and the staff is friendly. Anyone I bring here really enjoys it even though it's for purposes of a quick meal. That being said, they're also very fast. Wish they would add more vegetarian options but the pizza hits the spot so I can't complain much. 

Discounts for checking in! So definitely take the second to do that."	5	Cucina by Wolfgang Puck	4
"I enjoyed the unique view and ambiance of Lago on Saturday night but found there to be few vegetarian options to choose from. I had margarita pizza which was a bit over done. They claim to be tapas style but my friend and I had our own meals. I noted my friend's birthday was coming up and our server was kind enough to bring out a desert on the house. Overall service was good. 

I would return but likely not for the food just drinks. It is conveniently next to Hyde if you plan to make your way there after as the promoters refuse to leave you alone on the way to Lago."	3	Lago	4
"Yay for veggie ramen! Wanted ramen after a long day of running errands and having tried ramen for the first time in LA, i was under the delusional impression that everyone makes a mean veggie one! My bubble burst quickly as I pulled up to JINYA, got on the the wait list to realize the wait for one was over an hour because couples get table priority over me. I was starving so I started making calls from Yelp and was 10 deep when I got a hold of these awesome folks. 

Their veggie ramen is plentiful and definitely fills you up. I do wish they were able to add miso paste for more flavor to the veggie ramen but I was told this is only available with their broths that contain pork broth. 

Nevertheless it was good, I don't know if as good as JINYA (haven't had the one out here yet though) but certainly of caliber that I would return for. 

My hostess\/waitress was very sweet and asked me not to rush when I was the past patron after close. I had a bit of a hard time finding the establishment but it's across the street from the Korean strip mall on the ""darker"" side of the strip. They give a punch card for return visits, be sure to get yours!"	4	GO!KU J-Wraps & Ramen GOKU	4.5
East Side used to be good, but getting worse each time I go. Placed order for a large cheese. Was told 15 minutes. 35 minutes later someone asked me what I was waiting for. I told them and they had no idea about my order. The pizza maker didn't speak English and the person at the register had to translate. They kept apologizing and said my pizza would be ready in a couple of minutes. They hadn't even made it yet. I  told them to just refund my money. It took 3 people to return cash. They offered to deliver a pizza to me at no charge but it would have been 830pm. I just got my money and left. don't think I'll be returning.	1	East Side Pizza	3
"My first time here was in June 2016 and I thought they were the end all be all on my trip. I ate there 3 times in 5 days. 

I had buffalo wings, pancakes, and shrimp and grits. 

I went again in August of 2017, still good as last year. 

It's so hot that they have sprinklers spewing a light mist on you to cool you off. HOWEVER, I'm a black woman with black hair and my hair doesn't do well WET! It is a nice gesture but they could at least have it in a timer to go off periodically NOT continuously. This didn't happen in 2016. The waitress said they couldn't turn it off because it's on a timer. So for that, I'm taking away a star."	4	Tom's Urban	3.5
My husband and I came to Vegas for our anniversary and I knew I wanted to try and find somewhere that sold Sonoran dogs. He lived in Tucson AZ for two years and loves them, but it's hard to find a good version outside of AZ. We were really impressed with this place! We got the Sonoran dog and the Sinaluense smoothie. Both were so good! I would highly recommend this place. Definitely coming back!	4	Mexicali Raspados	4.5
If you are craving a New York-style pizza, this place has pretty good pizza. I have ordered from this place three times now, and the last two times, there was something left off my order. Last time, they forgot the sausage on the sausage\/pepperoni pizza. This time, they left off the pepperoni on the sausage\/pepperoni pizza and also forgot to include ranch with my order of chicken fingers. The crust is hit or miss. When it is good, it is REALLY good. However, the last couple times I have ordered, the crust was slightly undercooked.	3	Familia Pizzeria	4
The server suggested that we get it cooked to medium. Upon the first bite, the most pleasant flavor of the cherry glaze and pork took over my senses. I knew right away what it was: BEST PORKCHOP EVER! Hands down. The truffle oil fries were magical as well.	5	STK Las Vegas	4
"We went here last night. The food was amazing !!

We got 3 prime rib specials and the chicken dinner. It was incredible !!

Kudos to Kenny (our waiter) and Raphael (the chef). We've got multiple allergies and Raphael came out to our table to explain how each meal was prepared and what the different ingredients used. 

We WILL be back !!"	5	The Broiler	4
I would have to say that this is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in town for several reasons: The food is consistently good, the service is always impeccable, and the AYCE menu offers a vast array of appetizers, salads, rolls, nigiri, and dessert. I had a couple of girlfriends in from out of town and they claimed the sushi was very fresh. Most of the specialty rolls are delicious. My favorites are the the riceless rolls, though the rules of AYCE only allows each person to order 1 of each. I only gave four stars because of the numerous rules the restaurant has on the AYCE and how strict they are. I believe between the four of us, we had ordered 12 rolls, miso soups, gyoza, rib eye, a bowl of ramen, and fried rice. We stuffed ourselves to a miserable capacity and had to leave 2 pieces of sushi. We were charged for the entire cost of the roll in addition to the four AYCE. Order what you can fit in your stomach, though, and you are set. Oh, and they play all-girl group Japanese pop music videos that are so mesmerizing that my friends and I barely spoke to one another. When we did, it was to comment on the videos. Great place.	4	Sumo Sushi 2	3.5
I believe that every pho lover in Vegas will eventually make it to Pho Kim Long because the ample amount of reviews. The menu is pretty vast and the atmosphere is comfortable and nice. Although the food satisfied my pho craving, it did not impress me. My rating will go to Pho Saigon 8.	3	Pho Kim Long	3.5
There are many bars crowded around the area I live in. This, by far, is my favorite one. The bartender Mike is the best. Always friendly. Always funny. Always high energy. This is the place I usually end up late-late night\/super early morning. The HOT chicken fingers and fries are delicious!	5	PT's	3
Best ramen in town. It has wiped monta off my list of go-to ramen shops. I'm coming after sora soon!	5	JINYA Ramen Bar	4
A classic diner that I think is over-rated. The food is classic\/traditional. The space is somewhat laid out like a cafeteria - very open. The staff is what makes this place stand out. They're so friendly and extremely nice. It's very rare to find a place in Vegas where the staff seem to actually like you. There was a man, perhaps the owner or manager, who was walking around greeting each table and making sure everything was good. He chat with a few of the tables. About the food, I got a Jenna wrap which is a tortilla wrapped around hard-cooked eggs, avocado, cilantro, jalapenos, sour cream, and salsa. It wasn't anything special at all, but it was enough to satisfy my hunger. I also ordered a pancake and that made me very happy.	3	Mr Mamas	4.5
"When I want to ear somewhere that reminds me of home, I come to china mama. Just assume everything here is perfect. I will just list my favorites:

Ra mein in szechwan sauce
Pot stickers
Juicy pork dumplings
Fried rice cake with spicy chili
Green onion pancake
Steamed red bean dumpling (dessert)
Mapo tofu (I don't like tofu and even I LOVED this dish)
Chicken and veggies in Szechuan hot pot
Beef roll
Pork tripe in hot and spicy sauce

It is all good and even better left over."	5	China Mama Restaurant	3.5
I came to this restaurant thinking the food would be overpriced and mediocre. well, it was not mediocre. my boyfriend and I ordered the Toro tartare, 72-hr braised short ribs, lobster miso soup, yellowtail sashimi, tuna sashimi, king crab sashimi, salmon egg sashimi, and an order of the grilled shisito peppers. The toro came out first and was perfection. buttery fatty mild yet fresh. then came our sashimi and soup. the sashimi must be the freshest I have ever had in town and I am a local. miso soup is miso soup. nothing spectacular on that front. now, the short rib! boy, I don't have enough to say about how amazing they were. The presentation was...forget it. Forget the presentation. The fucking meat was so tender I felt I could have given it a glance and it would have fallen apart. I didn't want my shirt rib experience to be over truly an eat-with-your-eyes-shut-type deal. I am telling you. Get it. Your wallet might regret it but your taste buds won't.	5	Mizumi	4
I must say that I am not at all a fan of Italian cuisine. The menus always seem the same and every thing has fancy names and taste the same, but come in different shapes. This is not the case at Parma. The dinner menu at Parma changes daily and so is never the same. When you walk in, you'll notice that there is a deli where you can purchase meats and cheeses. I can't remember what the exact description was of the food I ordered. I just know it was pasta served in the Sunday sauce. It was exceptional, amazing, WOW. I ate every last bit on my plate. I have heard that if there isn't anything on the menu that you want, you can call in advance and make special requests and the chef will accommodate your request. The staff is always very friendly and helpful when making suggestions for you. This is, for sure, HANDS DOWN, the best Italian restaurant I have ever been to. GO.	5	Parma By Chef Marc	4
This place is fantastic!  I was visiting town, and after several people recommend this place, I thought I would give it a try.  I was a bit hesitant as it is not the normal glitz and glam of vegas....DO NOT BE FOOLED, this place was like winning the jackpot. The brisket and tacos were some of the very best I have ever had!  The sauce was amazing!!!  I will definitely go back every time I am in Vegas.	5	Jessie Rae's BBQ	4.5
Roomie and I were quite excited about the fact that a soul food restaurant opened up within walking distance of the house. We were even more excited about the fact that it delivers. He ordered the chicken and waffles ($9) and I ordered the fried chicken with sides of macaroni and cheese, hush puppies, and corn ($14). The ordered was delivered in 45 minutes. The chicken and waffles were good enough to satisfy the craving. The waffles seemed too similar to an Eggo waffle for me to give much praise too. My order of fried chicken as well as the fried chicken topping the waffle lacked any flavor and was overcooked. The skin and batter was a dark brown color and was slightly bitter. The macaroni and hush puppies were mediocre and the corn was straight out of a can. All in all, not terrible, but for the price, I probably will not eat there again.	3	Soul Food Cafe	3.5
This truly is a hidden gem. I have been eating at this restaurant for 20 years and the food is consistently delicious. The tom yum soup is the perfect combination of hot and sour. The pad kee mao is one of my favorite noodle dishes there. It is a must-try. The chicken chili mint is probably the best I have ever had. They make it with ground meat of your choice so every bite is infused with flavor and spices. The chef's special is also a favorite and I highly recommend it to anyone. One of the least recognized items on the menu is the house special omelet. The name and menu description does the dish NO justice. It is to DIE for. The curries are all great, however, if you like a thicker curry, you will have to let them know as the standard at Komol is the runnier version, with exception of the panang curry. You can order the food pretty spicy. They go from 1-10, with 10 being pretty hot and then superhot levels 1-5. If you love thai food, this place is a MUST MUST MUST!	5	Komol Restaurant	4
I will have to say this place impressed me more than I thought it would. Being that it is in the MGM (not predominantly Asian as is the Caesars Palace and Bellagio), I expected an overpriced version of P.F. Chang's. I shouldn't have assumed. In addition to the usual orange chicken and bbq pork, Pearl has taken very traditional Chinese fare and put the typical American twist on it. We ordered the Spicy on Spicy which is a staple dish that I order at all Chinese restaurants if it is on the menu. I can usually judge the restaurant by it's Spicy on Spicy. At Pearl, it was delicious but not as spicy as it should have been. It was the American version, but still great. We also ordered the kobe beef in sweet and sour sauce. Kobe beef is kobe beef: tender, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Slather on some sweet & sour sauce and you've got a kicked up version of sweet n sour beef. We also ordered the spinach sauteed in garlic which was cooked to perfection. There was just a little crunch left in the spinach and loads of garlic flavor. We also had the soup of the day which was mostly some vegetables in a pork broth. This is a restaurant I would definitely go back to. Keep in mind, it is fairly pricy. The kobe beef was $130 and there was enough on the dish for 5 people to have one small slice. I would still say that Jasmine's (Bellagio) versions of the same dishes are FAR superior.	4	Pearl	3.5
"I have only eaten Hawaiian food about three other times at L&L Hawaiian BBQ. I wasn't very impressed with their food at all but I thought it was because it was more of a fast food restaurant. I read all the great reviews about Island Flavor and was anxious to give it a shot. The restaurant itself is clean and the staff is pretty friendly. I ordered the Hawaiian Special which was LauLau with a side of fried rice, macaroni salad, some fish and tomatoes, and a creamy white dessert. 

LauLau is tender BBQ'd pork served in some type of edible leaf. I was told the leaves were edible so I cut it all up and added the house bbq sauce. The leaf was very bitter and odd tasting. It completely ruined the flavor of EVERYTHING else that was in my mouth so I moved as much of it aside as I could. After that, the meal wasn't horrible, but it didn't really impress me either. My friend ordered the saimin which is a bowl of ramen in broth and sprinkled with egg, imitation seafood and vegetables. He told me the broth was incredibly bland. Needless to say, I don't think that we will be keeping this place on our list of incredible places to eat."	3	Island Flavor	4.5
I can't give this place a 5-star review because I was pretty darn drunk when I went. The atmosphere is great at 4:30 in the morning. When you are slightly about to have  a hangover and are just stumbling out of some afterhours club and are not ready to see the sun yet...this place is perfect. Go, grab a delicious bloody mary, sit by the fire fountains, or get a table. Order yourself one of their great 10-egg omelets (I ordered one that had crab and avocado in it). It is a great place to go with your friends to fill up on pre-hangover food and sober up.	4	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
This bar is about as classy as it gets. It may seem cheesy that there is a man playing love songs on a grand piano, but a couple of Cable Cars in, the piano melodies almost become hypnotic. This bar is famous for their Cable Cars, a spiced rum cocktail served with a cinnamon\/sugar rimmed martini glass. They also make a fantastic Scooby Shot. I am not sure what they do, but it tastes almost like a tropical milkshake...creamy and delicious. If you want to snack, the smoked salmon and caviar plate is out of this world good. OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD, i said!	5	Petrossian Bar	4
"My buddy and I came here craving gyros and chicken fingers. The restaurant is large and spacious but not well-ventilated. The air inside was warm and humid. The staff was friendly though. 

We placed our orders for chicken fingers and a gyro. 15 minutes later, our food was served. I figured chicken fingers would be safe since they are pretty standard everywhere I go. The batter was....different. When I stabbed the chicken with my fork, the batter just kind of disintegrated and fell onto the plate...like a shell. When I ate it, the texture and taste was a bit similar to what you would get at Long John Silver's. It didn't taste bad at all, it just felt wrong in my mouth.

The gyro looked awesome..like your typical gyro stuffed with meet, onions, tomato, cucumber, lettuce, and tzaziki sauce. It wasn't the best, it wasn't the worst. It satisfies the craving.

Overall, it was ok. I would go back only because it is so close."	3	Ambrosia Café	3.5
The restaurant is really tiny and more of a cafe. The beef stew noodle is so perfect. Not too salty. Just enough beef, bok choy, and handmade noodles to satisfy any appetite. The pork chop noodle was also very good. It is a milder soup but the saltiness of the pork chop helps to balance it. The house-made chili gives everything the perfect kick and the burn pleasantly creeps up on you. The wontons in red sauce are also spectacular. I believe the red sauce has a vinegar base with hints of sweet and spicy. The restaurant is the perfect place to go during the winter.	4	Noodle Pot	3.5
I went for Sunday brunch. The patio was full so I would recommend making reservations for larger parties if you plan to have brunch on the patio while a band is playing. The ambience is very nice and relaxing. I would advise against wearing heels though. I was in wedges and found it very difficult to walk on their uneven flooring. Our server was amazing. He made suggestions of his favorite menu items and was very attentive. If you are starving, you will need to order more than one menu item. This restaurant serves very...how do you put it...healthy-sized portions of food. I'm tiny and I needed 2 things. Each dish runs about $15 unless you order just bacon, toast or cornbread. Then it's about $6. The food is rather tasty, but it wasn't $30-tasty. They also have bottomless mimosas and bloody mary though during brunch so it is worth the $$$ if you plan to have a Sunday Funday.	3	Bar+Bistro @ The Arts Factory	3.5
I was on my one-year anniversary date. We ordered the ceviche de pescado and the steak and lobster dinner. Let me tell you. They serve this salsa with a side of perfect chips. PERFECT CHIPS. The salsa is spicy, just a warning, but the best ever. The ceviche is lemony goodness. Simple and so delicious. Now the star of the show was the steak and lobster. Order it medium rare. It is so tender, you can literally cut it with a fork. It is served over a garlic buttery sauce and it is just amazing. The lobster is smothered in poblano peppers and onions. It is an amazing mexican twist on an American classic. GO.	4	Javier's	4
At 6:30pm, I decided to try this place out since it was just a couple of doors down from the phone repair shop where my daughter was having her iPhone repaired. The place was empty which said plenty to me, but the menu looked alright. The restaurant was extremely sterile and clean. We chose a booth and sat down. When I told the lady we needed a few more moments to order our food, she continued to stand at the table so I felt slightly rushed. I ordered a sliced beef noodle soup with wide rice noodles, a pad see ew, and a basil chicken and rice to split with my daugher. She also ordered a thai tea. I asked to keep a menu so that I could order a to-go item to take home and the server actually told me he needed it back so that was that. The tea came up right away and my daughter commented that it mostly tasted like milk and sugar. The beef noodle soup came up next and was no more than mediocre. The beef sliced seemed rubbery and lacked flavor. The basil chicken was alright, but it the vegetables were extremely undercooked...more like slightly warmed up, but still raw. The noodles in the pad see ew were all stuck together so I packed it up and hope my boyfriend will eat it, or maybe the dogs. Needless to say I won't be returning.	3	Thai Style Noodle House	3.5
I drive by this place on my way to work every morning and finally got a chance to stop in today. I ordered a large black iced coffee and a turkey\/provolone wrap. The coffee is nothing special, but the wrap - as simple as it was, was delicious. They make it with some kind of spicy (very spicy) sauce similar to a chipotle sauce. The space itself is very open and comfortable. I will definitely be returning.	4	The Lodge Coffee House & Tavern	4
I was excited to eat here after having seen the reviews. I called ahead to let the restaurant know that I would be ordering peking duck so they were already preparing it when I arrived. I started with some hot and sour soup. It was delicious. When the waitress brought out the duck, she prepared it all for us and wrapped it in the little buns, sauced it, added the green onion. It was so so good. Nothing short of amazing. It was the rest of the meal that was somewhat disappointing. I ordered the sauteed green beans and some yang chow fried rice. The fried rice was mediocre...nothing more than average. The green beans, which are usually a favorite chinese dish of mine looked delicious. I got the texture I was looking for, but  absolutely NONE of the flavor. It had no flavor whatsoever. None. Then the rest of the duck was brought out and it was very tender but was nothing out of the ordinary. I haven't crossed this place off my list because it is so close to where I live, but if I would only go there to satisfy a midweek craving for chinese food.	3	Long Jin Chinese Cuisine	3.5
Since I have been spoiled by Golden Deli in Southern California, it is very difficult for me to give a 5 to any vietnamese restaurant. I did enjoy Pho Saigon 8 more than Pho Kim Long because I believe that the food has much more flavor. I ordered the beef pho with tripe and tendon and it was quite good. It was the first Viet restaurant in Vegas that I ate at and gave a nod of approval to.	4	Pho Saigon 8	3.5
I will start off by saying that I am a local. I could have went to any sandwich joint\/cafe off the strip and paid a LOT less, HOWEVER, I knew I was on the Strip. If you are on the Strip, you're going to pay twice any amount for that sandwich. Get over it. I ordered the tarragon chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the turkey and avocado on wheat instead of whichever roll they had listed on the menu. The staff was happy to accommodate to our requests and were more than friendly. My sandwich was out of this world delicious. The bread was so surprisingly delightful. Crusty, but with a soft pillowy center. One sandwich was nearly more than enough for me. The boyfriend and I usually order two things and trade halves. His turkey\/avocado sandwich was exactly what he was looking for and made to satisfaction. It wasn't anything that lifted my eyebrows but there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. All good here if you're just looking for a quick sandwich.	4	Citizens Kitchen and Bar	3
I often drive by this spot and just assumed that it was another fast food thai joint. I was very wrong. The staff is very attentive and very friendly. The place is quite small but my friend and I were seated immediately. I ordered the pad kee mao and a bowl of chicken tom yum. My friend ordered some red chicken curry and then we ordered the fried banana rolls and a mango with sticky rice. My pad kee mao was surprisingly delicious. It was cooked just right so that the noodles stayed intact until the very last bite. Not too much sauce, just enough flavor. The soup was a bit sub-par, but then again, I am measuring it against the tom yum from Komol. I ordered everything at a level 7 spicy which the waitress said would be pretty spicy, but it was not spicy at all. That's fine, I just added a shitload of spicies from their little jars of fiery goodness. Now on to the dessert. WOW. The banana rolls were just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. The mango with sticky rice was probably the best I have ever had. They put a little more coconut milk in the rice than I am used to and it made a world of difference. The mango was also very ripe and sweet. It was good overall and I would recommend this place.	4	Benjarong Authentic Thai Cuisine	3.5
I went to Jaburritos for the first time last night and let me just say that it was the first time I was glad that there was a long line. All the menu items looked so good. There are so many wonderful choices and if, for some strange reason, you couldn't find something to your liking, you can make your own burrito\/bowl. It was like a Chipotle for sushi. Anyway, I got the Redondo minus the tortilla and added seaweed salad and sweet chili sauce. The boyfriend got a Rockport as is. I also built a custom burrito for my picky daughter. It was shrimp tempura, seaweed salad, cucumber, and sweet chili sauce. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because one of the girls in the line added tortilla chips when my order specified not to add it. I had to pipe up and ask her not to put them in. She apologized and picked them out. She also forgot the seaweed salad which, by then, I saw that I was holding up the line and didn't feel was a big enough deal. I still got charged for the extra topping, again, not a huge deal since I didn't say anything. All of the burritos tasted amazing. I cannot wait to go back.	4	Jaburritos Sushi Burritos	4.5
So, the first time I came here, I ordered a pepperoni pizza. It was the closest thing to a great New York-style pizza that I had ever had in Las Vegas. The crust was crispy on the bottom, but not too crispy. The cheese had a nice stretch without it falling off of the pizza and there was ample grease (which I usually blot off). Within the same week, I went back and tried a pizza with ham and jalapeno. The sauce, toppings, and cheese were all still up to par, however, the crust was not perfection as it was previously. It was slightly doughy and there was no crisp at all. I would say that if I were in the area, I would definitely go and pick up a pizza pie and, no doubt, would still enjoy it.	4	Broadway Pizzeria	4
This review is strictly for the bar. When I walked in, I was greeted kindly by the hosts and shown to the bar. I took my seat and was greeted by the bartenders on duty. I ordered gluten-free nachos off the new gluten-free menu and a vodka water. The nachos came on a huge platter enough to feed myself and three of my friends. Drink service was quick. The band was entertaining and so was the crowd. Not a bad spot to hang out on Friday night.	5	Hard Rock Cafe	3.5
I had seen this place while driving by and finally, on a whim, decided to stop in for lunch and give the food a taste. I ordered a little bit of everything. The pork belly with preserved vegetables, pot stickers, juicy pork dumplings, garlic chicken, cold duck, beef roll, garlic spinach, shanghai rice cake, and beef noodle soup. EVERYTHING tasted fantastic and was very reminiscent of the food I got back home in good ol' Arcadia\/Alhambra\/Temple City\/Monterey Park area. The service was a little bit slow, but the staff was very friendly and apologetic about it. They gave me 15% because it was during their grand opening period. I have heard good things about their breakfast and plan to go back soon.	4	1900 Asian Cuisine	3.5
If you live in Mountain's Edge are and are craving some late night eats, this is your place. I have had much better bar food elsewhere, but the food here is quite satisfactory. The place itself is dark, clean, and doesn't smell of cigarettes and cigars usually. The drinks and food are fairly priced and there is a good selection. The breakfast starts at midnight and that is what I usually order. You can't go wrong with any of it. The burger with the jalapenos is delicious even if you are sober.	4	Montana Meat Company - Durango	3.5
Great bar. Great music. Great food. Great management. I went there with a large party and it was very impromptu. The manager Trey got us a table and took good care of us. If you're looking for a party during or after-hours, Yolo's is awesome. Stop in and party.	5	YOLOS	3.5
"The fried rice cake in special sauce was quite yummy. The spicy pork ribs would have been great but they were so overcooked and dry. The beef intestine noodle soup had nice flavor but felt really grainy like 
It was full of sand. Nice environment and cool booths."	3	Soyo Korean Barstaurant	4
The rooms are very swanky, although not very large. The hallway can be a very funny thing if you have a bit much to drink. Once we got off the elevator and looked down the hall, then at our room number, we knew it would be a long trek. The room numbers started at 400 and our room number was 536. We thought perhaps there was a mirror at the end of the hallway because it appeared to go on forever, but we were wrong. The hallway does indeed go on forever. Once you finally get to your room, be prepared to see a nice modern little space. There is enough seating for perhaps 4 people to be comfortable...or perhaps 10 very drunk and happy people who don't mind standing on the bed or in the closet and in other various places in the room. The beds are very comfortable and the blackout curtains are among the best I've come across in Vegas hotels. Not an ounce of light leaks into the room. Room service will cost you your first born. We ordered breakfast for 2 with coffee and it was over $70. Other than that, it is a great and fun place to stay.	4	MGM Grand Hotel	3
I saw this place and stopped in for an Italian Beef sandwich. It was everything I hoped it to be. The giardinierre here is delicious. I get the sandwich wet which means they pour some of the jus over the sandwich. The owner was more than friendly.	4	The Taste of Chicago	3
"Usually, when I walk into a Japanese restaurant, I get the boisterous greeting from the sushi chefs and wait staff. None here. No biggie. Nice, clean-looking restaurant.

The fish tasted fresh. Ordered the tuna and super white tuna. Both were tasty. The rolls, however, I found a little disappointing. The atomic bomb was the only roll I thought was pretty good, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. The Sunrise roll I did not care for at all. It tasted like it was soaked in a garlic soy sauce. The Iris Special roll was very difficult to eat. The sauce tasted very similar to the sauce in the Sunrise roll, but it was a completely different sauce. There was a pasty, yet grainy texture to it and the flavor was pretty gross. 

All in all, I don't think i'd go there again."	3	Oyshi Sushi	3.5
Being a resident in Las Vegas for the past 12 years, I have been to almost every buffet on  and off the strip. The Bacchanal buffet is up there with my favorites - right alongside the buffet at Bellagio. I went on a Thanksgiving so it was extremely pricey. The first station I hit up was the Asian food station. The chow mein was pretty incredible and so was their mini bowl of Vietnamese beef pho. I worked my way to the Mexican station and enjoyed their green chili enchiladas. The bbq station was pretty standard since I think a bbq tastes the same, however, the hot sausage links were so amazing, I went back for a second helping of it. Now for my favorite: Dessert. I made sure to save room because the dessert station was heavily covered with every type of tasty delight you could imagine. I tried the pumpkin pie, the pecan pie, the key lime custard, chocolate mousse, raspberry parfait, and the gelato. Let me tell you about the gelato. Guava was delicious, honey was very unique, and the balsamic gelato (after acquiring some taste for it) is rather addictive. It is one of the few buffets on the strip that is worth every penny. Just make sure you get in line during an off-peak hour or you will be in line for forever and go on an empty stomach.	4	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"Found a new gem in the Southwest part of Vegas. It's a breakfast\/brunch\/lunch spot that happened to be on my way home from the gym. I'm glad boyfriend and I decided to stop in and give it a try. When we went, it was closer to closing and there were not many people in there. The food arrived very quickly after we ordered and the staff was very attentive. 

Here's what we tried: 

Goblet skillet - Turkey Sausage, Spinach, Roasted Red Pepper over Home Fries with Cheese. Not the deep fried kind, but the delicious kind fried atop a commercial flat-top stove. The skillet came with a side of your choice of 1 biscuit and gravy or toast. Of course, I went with the biscuit and gravy. The skillet came in a hearty portion that I was unable to finish. 

Griddle platter - Chicken, Spinach, Mushroom and Feta Cheese over Home Fries with 3 Eggs any style. Served with Pita Bread. This was also a scrumptious meal served in a large portion. Just the right amount of feta cheese rounded out the flavors. I liked the goblet skillet way better. 

Now, it took me a long time to figure out what I wanted because everything on the menu looked so good. Next time, I'm going to try the marinated steak tips because, as the menu says, it is ""marinated 18 hrs in Unicorn tears, served with 3 Eggs, Home Fries, Biscuit & Gravy."" UNICORN TEARS. 

Sold."	4	Stacks & Yolks	3.5
"I couldn't ask for more for a breakfast place...i mean that literally. I had never been to this restaurant prior to this and had no clue that the portions were as big as they are. I went ravenous so I ordered the chicken and waffles AND the snicker pancake. I mistook the look my friends gave each other when I ordered as ""she's really going to like this"" when really it was ""can't wait to see the look on this broad's face when she sees how HUGE everything is."" My chicken and waffles were served to me on a serving platter. It was big. It was fluffy. THERE WAS BACON COOKED RIGHT INTO THE WAFFLE BATTER! And it's covered with this big, juicy, crispy-battered, fried chicken. And THAT'S covered with syrup! I'm eating...and I'm like....WTF IS GOING ON IN MY MOUTH? EVERYTHING!

*calming down*

The snicker pancake soon followed and I kid you not when I say this thing was the size of a pizza. One big, fluffy, melted snicker-encrusted piece of pure heaven. Between bites, my friends were shoving mounds of house-made strawberry preserves on toast down my throat. If ever I had to describe the taste of diabetes (diabeetus), this would have been it. My friends, diabeetus...tastes.....GREAT. Go to Hash House-a-Go Go. You won't regret it."	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
After a weekend of some pretty hard partying, a friend and I decided that the best way to avoid an impending hangover was to eat a nice juicy burger and french fries. I ordered the blue cheese burger with caramelized onions and sweet potato fries. I have had many fine burgers in my life and this was not what I would rate among the top 10. I mean, it wasn't bad, but it was nothing special.	3	BLT Burger	3.5
This ramen restaurant is located conveniently 2 blocks away from where I live. I went there out of curiosity and hunger and ordered the spicy tonkotsu shoyu ramen. It really blew me away how delicious it was. The broth had just the right amount of spice and the toppings were all amazing. The portion was enough for me to be full, but not uncomfortably stuffed. The staff is polite and the place was super clean. It's no monta, but it is still incredibly good.	5	Omoide Noodles & Bowls	3.5
The food here does not exactly stand out to me as "delicious and unforgettable" however, the restaurant is pretty much across the street from where I live. The breakfast is very typical of what you could make at home. The restaurant is dimly lit so it great for hangover mornings. The service is usually pretty outstanding. The staff is very attentive and quick to bring you anything you want. They've even got jokes.	3	T-Bird Lounge & Restaurant	4
The five stars is for the pizza. Definitely not for the health-conscious at all...meaning..it is perfect. Big, fat, floppy, grease-dripping slices. I don't think I have needed chapstick since having eaten it 2 days ago.	5	Mama Depalma's Pizza & Bistro	3.5
This is not a place I chose to go to because I heard the food was great. I went to this place to grab some food before attending the Soundgarden\/NIN concert. It was a convenient place to go to for food and it also has a bar. I went on a Saturday and most the people there were also there for the concert. I ordered the Morning Glory burger with sweet potato fries. I think I got lucky with my burger because it was so delicious. It was everything I love about breakfast (my favorite meal) served on top of a juicy burger. The sweet potato fries were pretty badly overcooked so I did not enjoy those. The food is extremely pricy for burgers, but not uncommon for food prices on the strip. Service is pretty slow and it is somewhat like In N Out where you order, then wait for them to call your number and you grab your food. I would have given only 3.5 stars but Yelp doesn't give the option.	4	Ketchup Premium Burger Bar	3
"I order delivery from this restaurant almost once a week. The food here isn't great by any means, but it is very convenient since they are so close and they also deliver. Everything tastes very generic, but will satiate the appetite if Thai is what you are craving. If you want your food spicy, order it 2 stars more than what you normally get. I order a spicy level 8 and is not nearly spicy enough. If you order delivery and you have any custom requests, make sure you emphasize it. I am allergic to shrimp and they have added shrimp tto my tom yum chicken soup on more than one occasion. 

So some reviews on menu items:

Tom yum = 3 star: It is good. Not to sour, not too sweet and they use the delicious straw mushrooms and not the cheap button mushrooms. 

Curries = 4 star: I would say the curries are their best dishes. They are a little bit thinner in consistency but not overly sweet. The yellow and red are my favorites. 

Beef noodle soup = 3.5 star: It is a little above average, but nowhere near as great as some of the other soups I have had. I order it with the wide flat rice noodles instead of the smaller noodles since the smaller noodles have the tendency to get soggy really quick and then break to many small pieces while I am eating it. Good broth.

Thai fried rice = 3 star: Meh..nothing special

Spicy basil noodle = 3.75 star: A litte on the sweet side and they are rather delicious, but once again, I have had way better. 

Chicken chow mein = 2 star: This is a weird dish to eat at a thai restaurant, I know, but since trying the chow mein at Komol, I have been on the prowl for a thai chow mein that will rival. I have yet to find such a chow mein. 

Thai beef salad = 2 star: Don't even bother at this restaurant. Such a disappointment. The dressing was bad. The portion size was awful. Lettuce was in leaf form (not cut) and VERY soggy (no crunch).

Pad Thai = 2 star: It was so very bland. It tasted like rice noodles, chicken, and bean sprout with a HINT of peanut and thai-ness. 

I have been to Pin Kaow 1 near Lake Mead and Rainbow and their food is definitely much better than at this location."	3	Pin Kaow Thai	3.5
So, today I went to Anime ramen for the very first time. I ordered the gyoza and the budae jjigae ramen. The gyoza was fantastic. I ate it with the chili oil at the table and it was heaven. The ramen was perfect. Perfect texture, perfect flavor. I couldn't have been happier with the food. The waitresses all wore anime-style wigs and costume. It was a fun experience and I would highly recommend the place to anyone looking for a great bowl of ramen.	5	Anime Ramen & Teriyaki	3.5
I wasn't too sure what i was about to get myself into. I was being sent for Korean supplies, but usually go to a Chinese market for the foods I need.

I have no complaints about my visit here. Service was good and the food was even better. We had the crispy eggplant plate which was so good! And also orange chicken & flat noodles which were also good. Proportions I thought were perfecf. I liked how we were all served soup before our food got there.

"Two words: bottomless brunch!  Those are probably two of my favorite words on the planet, especially when they are put together!!  Who can hate a place that offers endless mimosas and bloody mary's?  Not this girl, that's for sure!  A friend and I were craving a good brunch and wanted to try something new so we decided to check this place out after book marking it forever ago.  We walked in and it was pretty empty, which for some reason always makes me nervous, because shouldn't a good place be packed and have a huge wait.  Well, I learned my lesson... I definitely should not be judging this book by its cover.  

We started our meal with mimosas.  The best way to start the day in my opinion.  The menu is small, which is exactly what I need since places with pages and pages of menu can be overwhelming and take forever to sift through to figure out what you want.  The short menu helped me get straight to what I wanted.  We decided to split the beef sliders and I got the breakfast burrito.  The sliders were awesome and their fries were AMAZING.  I can truly appreciate some good french fries, and these were worth it!  My breakfast burrito was also on point.  I do wish the chorizo had more of a kick to it, but just a minor detail compared to the meal as a whole.  I LOVED the live music!! There were just two guys playing piano and saxophone and singing in the corner and it was definitely a great addition to the vibes the places was letting out! 

Another small hiccup in our visit was that we got coffee and it took a lengthy time to finally get to our table.  For how slow they were when we first entered, I was surprised by how long it took for our food to come out and our mimosas to be refilled.  But, for the prices, I honestly don't deserve to complain.  Another great thing about this place is that you can switch from mimosas to blood mary's and vice versa if you choose.  I know at most places that offer bottomless you need to stick to one, but not here!  We will definitely be coming back because this place has all the elements to a wonderful Sunday Brunch!"	4	Elements Fine Casual Dining & Cocktails	4
"I won't lie... I did go in with high expectations, so that might be why this place is only resulting in a three star rating for me, but I just wasn't wow-ed.  I LOVE mac n' cheese...it's basically a passion of mine.  I will say I loved all the different options and flavors they offer!  Definitely some interesting mac n' cheese concoctions.  A friend and I were so fired up that we decided to get four different options and then taste test from them all.  We got the truffle mac, the smokehouse mac, the spinach artichoke mac, and we created our own pasta that was a penne pesto with mozzarella.  Of all of the options, the truffle mac was the only one that I'd really kill for.  But, I am biased because I am a FIEND for anything truffle!  Otherwise, all the others were ""eh.""  I don't know if my expectations killed the dream, but I just wasn't amazed.  

They do sell beer and wine which is nice!  AND, they DELIVER.  Which is definitely nice to know.  If I'm ever sitting home and don't feel like throwing together some mac n' cheese it's a great option.  I just don't know if I'll be dying to go back unless I'm really, really, really craving some mac n' cheese."	3	Mac Shack Spring Valley	3.5
This place is all about the view. The food was MEH, the service was extremely cold. Order a $22 glass of wine and it's swung by the table by some random guy, blink and I'd have missed it's delivery. When at a restaurant of this supposed caliber, I expect an explanation of the wine, etc. Food was just not at all appetizing. Oh and the decor of the place is like eating inside an operating room.	2	MIX	4
"My best friend had been asking me to try this place with her for quite a while and so I finally caved.  You might get a little confused driving there, at least I was, or maybe my gps took me a funny way-who knows.  But, once you get there Baguette Cafe is definitely a good find!  It's a small little place and the staff is extremely nice and helpful.  The girl at the counter could tell it was our first time and walked us through the menu!  I decided to keep it simple and got a ham and swiss croissant and an iced white chocolate macadamia nut cookie latte. Yes, you read that correctly.  When I saw that on the menu, I thought I had died and went to heaven. 

The ham and swiss croissant was typical.  It was pretty good, but nothing that blew me away or stood out, but then again I did keep it simple and didn't order one of their other more specialty items.  The latter though-whew!! I was in love as soon as my lips touched the straw sucked up that liquid gold.  If for the latte alone, I am in OBSESSED with this place.  From what I could over hear from the party next to us, their quiches are delicious as well.  There was a chocolate pie I was interested in trying, but was too full from my main meal.  This is definitely a healthy alternative for when I am on my best friend's side of town.  And let's be honest, the trek is worth it for that iced white chocolate macadamia nut cookie latte!!!!"	4	Baguette Cafe	4.5
"I'm excited to go back and try Mad House again.  I've only been once and I enjoyed it, but I want to try some of the other things on their menu.  I got one of their sweeter options, going against everything I know I like about coffee.. and sweet is just not me.  Even though my choice was a little sweeter than I would've liked, I still really, really enjoyed it.  

In addition to the coffee, I got one of their almond croissants and that was absolutely delicious.  My friend also really enjoyed what she got.  We tried some of their macaroons and those were absolutely delicious, also!  

The thing I loved most about this place, was the ambiance.  It definitely reminded me of the cafes I would frequent back in New York City.  It is a very chill place I can see myself going to lesson plan and hang out with a good cup of coffee.  They've got cool little murals on the tables and fun game around the place to hang out and enjoy.  We played a quick game of tic tac toe while sipping on our coffee and enjoying our snacks.  

I haven't been back since, but I do plan to try it again and try some more of the options on their menu.  When I do, I'll be sure to update this review with my opinion on more!"	4	Mad House Coffee	4
"This place is definitely for all my ladies and gentlemen out there who are ""skinny fat.""  You know the type I'm talking about... You love food and don't know what you would do without it, but hate the extra pounds it adds to your amazing physique.  Yeah, this place is golden for you. 

You walk in and are greeted with enthusiasm from the staff that works there. The decor is bright and cheery and one of the walls even boasts, ""live happy."" I can't imagine not being happy when walking into this place. The menu can be a little overwhelming because it is quite jam packed, but make sure to read it through before placing your order. You don't wanna order something in a rush and miss something you could really love.

I ended up going with the Chickawaffadopolis (basically chicken and waffles). It was AMAZING. The chicken strips were perfectly crispy and the waffle was delicious. My friend got the Cranburkey with a side of truffle fries. I stole some of her truffle fries and they might be some of the best I've had here in town. 

I also went with one of their coldpressed juices: the Summer Quench (cucumber, celery, Apple, and lemon) and it was great!! I really enjoyed it and would definitely get it again. 

I think what I honestly enjoyed the most was the friendly atmosphere the staff treated the guests with. The person at the counter was amazing and super helpful since it was our first time. I will definitely be going back again soon!"	5	SkinnyFATS	4.5
"I drove by this place at least 4 times before FINALLY realizing that it's a kitchen inside of Mr. G's.  Don't waste gas by making the same mistake I did! 

Honestly, I love greasy heart attack food.  Johnny Vegas Grill is just the place for that.  My bestie and I were both just in the mood to stuff our faces and have no regrets!  This place was pretty close to work so we decided to check it out.  We ended up getting SO much food.  We split a burger and got a bunch of apps, including: cheese curds, olive poppers, mozzarella sticks, and boneless wings.  

For the most part, the food was great.  Some of it could have used a little more flavor, but overall I was pleased.  

The only reason they lost a star was for service.  My friend and I were intrigued by the pizza quesadilla and we ended never getting to try it.  They completely forgot it was on our ticket and we never got it.  It ended up being on our check... which we of course got it taken off.  Also, I'm not sure if they solved this problem since we were last there, but their prices on the menu didn't match the prices in their computers that they actually charge.  The prices were higher in the computer by anywhere from 50 cents to a dollar.  I know a lot of these are service no-nos, but my reviews are heavily reliant on the food and the food didn't disappoint.  I'll probably be back one day when I'm having my next heart attack food craving."	4	Johnny Vegas Grill	4.5
"I am definitely planning on trying to become a regular here!  Every week I find myself talking about how I need to change my eating habits and start eating right!  (More like every morning, but I'm trying to make myself feel better here!) Well, Greens and Proteins is definitely a step in the right direction!! I met a girlfriend here one afternoon for a quick lunch and I was definitely in love!  We both got smoothies and split one of their breakfast options.  I was definitely satisfied by the end of our meal!  

I got their acai smoothie and I loved it!  It wasn't as thick as some smoothie places make their smoothies and I was definitely happy about that!  It was the perfect flavor and consistency.  AND, it filled me up!  Now, I'm a hungry, hungry hippo, so I usually need a lot more than a smoothie to satisfy my hunger.  But not here!  My appetite was completely satisfied and I had to force myself to split the frittata with my friend.  Which was also delicious!!! 

This is definitely an amazing healthy alternative in the area and I can't wait to go back and try even more!"	4	Greens and Proteins	4
"Ready to be the coolest and hippest person in your friend group? Park on Fremont will win you that title. Right across from the Fremont experience downtown, Park is perfect for people watching! You will see people of all walks of life doing all kinds d things. You will not get bored... Promise. 

This place is all about the cocktails. I'm talking straight up mixology. The first few times I went and read their cocktail list k thought they were crazy with some of their concoctions...but that is why they're the experts and I'm not. Although they sound like crazy mixtures, their drinks are some of the most delicious drinks I've had here in town.  If you go, the pillow talk is the most refreshing and amazing drink I've had-ever. 

This place is also ultra trendy. You and your friends trying to find someplace new to try that's cool and hip? Suggest this place and your group won't be disappointed. From the second you walk in you know your entering a cool place as the staff is dressed in flannels. Flannels are always a good sign. The decor adds to the cool, unique, and trendy vibe you get. Everything is super bizarre but put together in a way that works. 

If weather permits, I really recommend sitting out on the back patio. Really cool seating and great vibes out there. Also, if you can pull yourself away from your party for long enough there is a ""secret"" seesaw behind the wall with the fireplace in it. Always get good laughs when you take a ride on that thing. 

Like I said, this place is all about the scene and the cocktails. That is why they get 4 stars and not 5. Although it's a great place and I will definitely be going back time and time again.... Their food, to me, is just good. Which isn't a bad thing, but I also don't think it's 5 star worthy. Also, their service can be pretty slow. I've only ever had one server there that took care of us at a good rate. Otherwise, I've always been left waiting. Trying to flag down my server to speed the process along. Other than this, though, Park is the place to be! Recommend it.. You won't regret it."	4	Park on Fremont	4
I love breakfast food and i was extremely excited to try this place after reading previous reviews. I will say the service was amazing and the staff is super nice and attentive, they had one major pitfall for me...their country gravy. A friend and I split a bunch of stuff and I just wasn't as impressed as I expected to be. Their breakfast sandwich was good and so were their potatoes. Their chicken noodle soup was a bit salty. But it was really the country gravy I was most disappointed in. I like to consider myself somewhat of a gravy expert and there was just no flavor to it. Definitely very meaty, which I could appreciate, but sill lackluster in seasoning. I definitely was not dazzled.	3	Mr Mamas	4.5
"This review is purely based on experience seeing as I haven't had the pleasure of trying their food just yet.  After dinner downtown, my bestie and I decided we wanted just one more drink before we headed home.  We had heard good things from friends about Perch and went for it!  

Without even trying their food, I already fell in love with this place.  We walked in and sat at the bar.  The bartender was SO friendly and made our whole experience wonderful!  I decided to go out on a limb and try their Caiparinha.  Now, it is hard to impress me when making one of these because I've spent some time in Brazil and know exactly how one of these should taste Brazilian style.  Well, I was not disappointed!  The drink was pretty authentic and impressive.  

I can't wait to go back and try their food, especially their brunch!  Great spot downtown in Container Park!  Can't wait to update this review when I go back!"	4	Downtown Terrace	4
"When the craving for Mexican hits, it hits hard and nothing else will satisfy.  So I was not stopping until I had some proper Mexican food!  Some co-workers had suggested Macayo and I was pleased to find out there was a location five minutes from my work... how convenient!! I went in with a friend and we were famished, so of course we ordered close to everything on their menu!  We were greeted with warm chips and salsa, which was amazing!  We started with their appetizer sampler and their dip sampler.  Both were HUGE portions and we immediately regretted how much we ordered! The appetizer sampler was great!  It offered pretty much two of everything, which was perfect for us to split.  Their dips are all amazing. 

After sufficiently stuffing our faces with this, the rest of what we ordered showed up at our table.  Now our server definitely thought we were crazy for how much we ordered, but we hadn't been forewarned about the serving sizes! (Consider yourselves warned!  They're HUGE!)  We got a few things to split since we were new to Macayo and wanted to try as much as we could.  We got the TCT and juevos con chorizo.  I feel like we also got something else that is escaping my mind right now!  The TCT is a giant open, family style quesadilla.  It was a great way to share with my friend and put exactly what we wanted on our own quesadilla.  Brilliant in my opinion!  For example, my friend loves beans but I don't... serving the quesadilla this way lets her have what she loves without ruining the quesadilla for me, and vice versa.  

Now after spending a few months in Brazil, I am quite the chorizo enthusiast.  For this reason, I get kind of nervous when I try chorizo at a restaurant, because let's be honest how do you compare to local Brazilian chorizo?  Macayo did not disappoint! Their chorizo was delicious that I ate up every last bite! 

Now, I only tasted one very, very briefly, but from what I'm told their Margaritas are amazing.  From looking at their menu, they definitely offer a variety of flavors and types and my friend got one and they're huge!  I unfortunately don't drink tequila anymore (let's just blame one bad night in college for that one) and couldn't enjoy one of the refreshing drinks, but you should definitely get one next time you stop by Macayo!"	4	Macayo Vegas	3
Definitely the best thai place I've tried here in vegas. I always get the same thing when I come and I am never disappointed! The garlic fried rice is my favorite, but my best friend always gets the 3 color curry and swears by it. The chicken satay is awesome! If you want your life changed forever for the better get the roti for dessert! You won't be upset. Definitely a must try and well worth it!	5	Le Thai	4
"If you want to be like the cool kids, definitely make a stop at Grouchy John's. I felt immensely cooler just by stepping inside and seeing their decor and patrons. This definitely reminds me of a coffee shop I would come across when I lived in Downtown NYC. Funky music comes out of the speakers and eclectic art hangs on the walls that you can actually buy if you're interested in picking up some artwork with your coffee. 

As for their menu-they've got a wide range of flavors and concoctions that I'm sure will satisfy your tastebuds. My best friend did get something with Nutella and her only complaint was that it was a little too thick. I really appreciated that they had almond milk as an option because not all places will offer that. 

I definitely enjoyed the ambiance and could see myself just hanging there getting some work done, sipping on some coffee."	4	Grouchy John's Coffee	4.5
"This is not one of my regular joints when I go to Town Square, but I was going to see a movie and a friend of mine wanted sushi so we decided to try it out. Now, I should preface this with the fact that I am not a sushi eater... It's just not my thing. But, as a semi-normal human being with taste buds I can still find something on the menu I enjoy. We ended up ordering a bunch of happy hour appetizers (YES! They have happy hour!!!) and a carafe of sangria. Sadly, the only thing that has real impressive flavor was our sangria. Which was actually delicious and I would go back, but only for the sangria. 

The food just wasn't anything that wowed me. There was a lot of lacking flavor that I was just expecting and excited for. It's not that the food was bad, it just want that good either. It was okay, and who wants to settle for okay? Not I. If we go to Town Square and want Asian again, we'll probably hit this place up. But, it's isn't the kind of place we'll be dying to go back to and craving."	3	Kabuki Japanese Restaurant	4
"The only thing that redeems the Yard House is its phenomenal beer selection.  There's honestly nothing better than seeing a million taps in front of you, especially if you're the person who prefers beers on tap over any other alcoholic beverage.  My usual is the house honey blonde, but I do enjoy changing it up for darker beers or different flavors sometimes.  I usually end up sitting at the bar because at a table the service is hit or miss.  This isn't to say the service at the bar is a million times better, but I definitely enjoy the bar more than a table.  

As for the food I have my usuals that I always go to.  Yard House to this day still has some of the best truffle fries I have ever had.  Sometimes I've been disappointed with them coming out soggy, but flavor-wise, they're still on point!  I love the queso here as well!  I tend order those two as my meal and call it a day.  

Yard House at Town Square is definitely an easy staple in my life.  It is half way between my apartment and my best friend's apartment and we love the beer selection!  Other than the service, there really isn't anything I can complain about!  We always come back time and time again!"	3	Yard House	4
"My best friend is German and she happened to be craving German food one night and asked if we could please, please go to the Hofbrauhaus.  I had never experienced it, so I decided to give it a whirl.  We showed up and all the servers are in costume.  I love that!  Some people might think it's lame, but I personally think it adds to the experience!  

Huge beers? Yupp, my version heaven!  The beers were good, big, and flowing all night!  We spent quite a long time drinking and snacking the night away!  Their food?  Just as good as the beer!! Since my bestie and I are both equally indecisive, we decided to split two of their main dishes.  We got the burger and the chicken sandwich.  Both were AMAZING!  The meat combination in the burger had the perfect flavor and made it stand out compared to other burgers I've had in this city.  The chicken sandwich was perfectly crispy and I enjoyed every second of it.  

It wouldn't be a complete German experience without getting a pretzel!  Just as enjoyable as our main dishes.  

Having the german music in the background, great food, and good service... this place earns its 4 stars.  It's a bit pricey, which makes me upset because I can't afford to go there more often.  But, I will definitely be back as a local when I'm feeling the German itch!"	4	Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas	3.5
Tried this place for the first time today and I fell in LOVE. Amazing vibes and just such a cool culture. I got the iced white mocha and my best friend got the Nutella cappuccino and both were equally delicious. My white mocha was exactly what I needed in this Nevada heat. The service was great and it was a chill environment. I cannot wait to go back!	5	Sambalatte	4
I will say, the main reason I didn't love this place was the service. We came here on cinco de mayo and the place was not busy at all. My group made it quite clear that we were there to eat and drink and the server didn't come to us even though our first round was empty for at least 20 minutes. After we got our food, I got the burger and all I wanted was some ketchup. The server did not come and ask us once whether we needed anything or how our food was after it was dropped. He dropped the check without even asking if we wanted another round or if we wanted dessert. I could understand if they were at least busy but it was super quiet while we there so he had the time to give us better service. All that being said, the queso is amazing. I just wish we had a better server.	3	La Comida	3.5
Came here for their happy hour after work on an extremely hot day since they have frozen drinks! Definitely an extensive tropical drink menu which I can definitely appreciate. The passion fruit mango white sangria is awesome! Definitely recommend that! The chicken quesadilla was a bit much for me, but still okay. BUT the beef empanadas were AMAZING! Definitely an interesting crowd depending on what you're looking for. One of the bartenders we had-Jason- was awesome! Super personable and great service!	4	Bahama Breeze	4
Egg works has the best breakfast in town. I always go between the sunrise mountain or the mashed potato omelette and either is a wonderful choice. So accommodating if you wanna change it up. At this particular egg works the service has been hit or miss. One time I was here and had Robert and it was the worst service I've ever had. Today, though, my server was PHENOMENAL!! Her name was Chelsea and she was on point! She would bring us things before we even asked like a mind reader! Thanks Chelsea! Also there's a dog friendly patio which is great for me and my two pups!	5	Egg Works	4.5
Love this place! I love the amazing whiskey selection here and I love the wine flights. There are a lot of amazing selections and you really can't go wrong. I love the grown up grilled cheese and the arrancini! Tried the the marguerite flatbread for the first time the other day and loved it! Really, all the food there is awesome... I do wish, though, that the serving portions were a little larger because I'm a hungry, hungry lady. The main reason this place only gets four stars from me because the service can be shotty. I love the bartenders and usually get great service at the bar. But, sometimes my group will choose to sit outside and some of the servers are great, but some of them can be pretty rude and take a while. On multiple occasions we've noticed them openly talking about other customers which just isn't cool. Get it together ladies.	4	Double Helix Wine & Whiskey Lounge	4
Came here for a staff happy hour after work one day and was amazed at how delicious the bbq was! I got the pulled pork sandwich and it was amazing. Their Mac n cheese was some of the best Mac n cheese I've ever had. Ever. The staff was awesome! They're super chill and provide great service. Great people, great food! Definitely my kind of place!	5	Cody's Smokin' Barbecue	4.5
First thing is first it is absolutely ridiculous that they are making their employees stand outside in 100+ weather taking orders it is absolutely sad and disgusting to see them taking advantage of them like that. Second all of the manger could careless about having enough staff I see the same 2 people doing all the work while.  a sad work environment to say the least.	1	McDonald's	1.5

I got in line at the oyster bar 30min prior to it opening at 5pm.  As 5 drew near, I watched with aggravation, 3 parties seated ahead of me because they were "VIP", because these people gamble there A LOT they earned some BS status that allowed them some perks, like jumping the line to eat.  Basically, I felt discriminated against because I'm not a gambler. After speaking with Travis and being told that the "higher ups" granted these perks he couldn't do anything about it. The place is freaking too small to allow these "VIP" access and push everyone else's wait time over an hr. Travis and his staff did their best to pacify my anger but in the end the stupid "higher ups" need to rethink what they are trying to achieve with this location, for me, I felt alienated because I don't sit and donate money to machines regularly like these "VIP". I will be going to the oyster bar at Texas station or wait two hrs at palace station because I'll at least know I earned my seat and everyone else in front of me paid their due by standing in the same lines.  The worst experience I've ever had with any of the oyster bar locations and that includes the 2+ hrs I've waited in line at palace station.	1	The Oyster Bar	3.5
"Had a great time here.  Food and customer service was outstanding. I have only one suggestion: add some draft beer from the tap.....this was ten months ago...
Here I am again for the third time since...very dissatisfied with the lack of preparation on a busy holiday like Mother's Day...it's not like the holiday was just going to creep up on you...I plan ahead in anticipation of it being busy...made the reservation assuming that this would expedite my wait time...reservation made for 1230 it's now close to 1pm and still waiting....took my rating down to 3 stars...not into hearing excuses... just fix your process in anticipation of being busier than normal.."	3	Via Brasil Steakhouse	4
Not the best,  not the worst, service is where you make customers repeat customers...need another sushi maker during peak dinner hours...my orders got bypassed by a bigger party...is that fair? I think the answer is obvious, so keep your apologies because it doesn't stop my stomach from growling	2	OMG Sushi	4
Today, I waited in the drive thru for 40 min because there was no dedicated cashier for both the front and drive thru areas....Daniel Ocampo is the general manager of this store #903...apparently he is the incompetent person who is stupid enough to not adequately staff his store. I guess it's the reason for the poor quality of staff, poor customer service...it's a reflection on him as manager...up the ladder we go till something at the corp level is done to correct the problems this store is having...I would have drove off but once you're in the drive-thru you're locked in and have to wait for cars in front to leave...when I arrived there were only two cars in front of me...never would have thought I'd have to wait 40 mins...find a different location	1	Del Taco	2
Decent food nothing extravagant with the exception of creme brulee. They have a make your own taco section which i went for. Pad thai tasted like chow mein. You get what you pay for. Will still recommend though.	3	Bistro Buffet	3
"Had my bachelors party dinner here w\/ my groomsmen and other buddies. Impeccable service by the staff. Especially our waiter Marcelo who went above and beyond to make sure everything was right. 

As for the food, side dishes such as: lobster mac and cheese, onion rings, potatoes au gratin, and beef carpaccio were amazing. All our steaks were cooked perfect and tasted amazing. I ordered the tomahawk ribeye.. my god, that was sooooooo yummy!

To sum it all up, Del Frisco's never disappoints. Easily one of the best restaurants I've ever been to!"	5	Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House	4.5
"I have been following OtherMamalv on Instagram for a while and drool everytime I see their posts of fresh uni and oysters! I finally got the chance to have dinner there and I will definitely be back again. 

Drinks: We ordered the Billie Joe and Trixie. The Trixie was awesome, Jameson with honey syrup and candied ginger! The Billie joe was refreshing with gin and cucumber but didn't quite WOW me.. 

Dinner: We started off with the French toast cavier. Don't think I would order it again but definitely worth a try! Different from anything I've tried before. You have a combination of the saltiness from the cavier and the sweet syrupy French toast. 

Blueproint raw oysters. $1 each. They were cold and delicious! Perfect! 

Scallop sashimi was awesome. I'm a big fan of sashimi and this did not disappoint. Melts in your mouth! 

Lastly, we got the mussels and waffle fries. I thought the portion was big enough for two. The mussels are big and meaty! The fries were good but I would have rathered some bread to soak up the sauce. 

I can't wait to come back and try the oysters, Kauai shrimp and amberjack crudo. Thanks OtherMama for a great dinner!"	4	Other Mama	4.5
Like the environment and the staff was very friendly. All you can eat sushi is delicious with a lot of variety. Bathrooms are clean and neat looking.	5	Daisho Sushi	4
"The service is amazing at the Border Grill. Autumn knew all the ins and outs of the menu and was fantastic at describing how everything is prepared. 

We started with the Green Corn Tamales (free with Yelp check in) and the Queso Fundido. ($14.00) Both of these appetizers were outstanding but the tamales were my favorite. The fresh corn was amazing. 

I ordered the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas with a side of beans and rice. ($37.00) They were made with braised chicken, Mexican cheese, Poblano chiles, corn, pickled onions and coal charred chayote squash. It was very flavorful. We also ordered the brisket , Al Pastor and chicken tacos. ($19.00) The grilled pineapple salsa made the Al Pastor tacos the best of the bunch."	4	Border Grill	4
"After reading the Yelp reviews for the Yardbird Southern Table and Bar I decided to make a reservation. The reviewers were spot on. This is a great southern fare restaurant with a warm friendly staff. 

Our waiter recommended the Chicken-N-Watermelon-Waffles. ($36.00) my husband and I added buttermilk biscuits ($7.00) and crispy Brussel Sprouts ($10.00) to our order. The fried chicken is served with spiced watermelon and a Vermont cheddar cheese waffle. They kick it up a notch by adding a side of honey hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup. The flavor combination of this meal is incredibly delicious. The chicken is 100 percent natural with no steroids or hormones and brined for 27 hours before serving. I loved the biscuits and the brussel sprouts did not disappoint."	5	Yardbird Southern Table & Bar	4.5
"We waited about 30 minutes for a table and it was worth every minute. 

I ordered the Hells' Kitchen Burger ($15.00) and my husband decided on the U.K. Burger. ($15.00) Both of these burgers hit it out of the park. They were amazing!! Cooked to perfection!! The Hells' Kitchen was prepared with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeños,fresh avocado, roasted tomatoes and jalapeño pesto aioli. The U.K. had dublinar cheese, major grey's chutney and arugula.  

We also tried an order of sweet potato fries. ($9.00) They were fresh and hot."	5	Gordon Ramsay Burger	4
"Gallagher's showcases their dry-aged steaks in a glassed exterior wall to draw attention to those passing by.  This is brilliant marking because the steaks look absolutely amazing. 

We started with shrimp scampi, clam chowder and a wedge salad. The shrimp scampi ($18.00) was prepared with a tomato cream sauce and was very good. The clam chowder ($8.00) was made with a heavy hand of bacon. The bacon choked out the flavor of clams. The salad ($9.00) was fresh, cold and delicious. 

For entrees we took the advice of our waiter and ordered the cowboy ribeye. ($47.00) It does not come with sides so we added creamed spinach ($9.00) and a baked potato. ($9.00) The ribeye was cooked perfectly and looked mouthwatering good. The compliments stop there because the steak was really tough and bland....a huge disappointment. The baked potato was good but the creamed spinach was not seasoned properly and had a distinct taste of flour."	3	Gallagher's Steakhouse	4
"The quality of the 6 inch lobster roll was good but I felt that it did not deserve the exorbitant price. ($30.00 with tip ....for a 6 inch lobster roll, small fries and ice tea...served in a paper basket with a plastic fork)

The lobster was seasoned perfectly and the meat was tender. The bread was a bit thick for the amount of lobster so I had to pull some off to balance the taste."	3	Lobster ME	3.5
"Like most of the other reviewers we heard about a secret pizza place in the Cosmopolitan that we just had to try. This place doesn't have a name or signage. We located it down a long hallway on the 3rd floor. 

They give you a choice of several pre-made pizza's and reheat them to order. I decided on a mushroom and pepperoncini slice and a smart water. ($6.50 a slice and $4.50 for the water) The pizza slice was flat and very crisp. The portion of cheese and sauce was balanced so that it did not weigh down the crust or make it greasy. There was a scattering of mushrooms baked into the cheese and the pepperoncini was tossed onto it after it was heated. I liked it and would return on another visit."	4	Secret Pizza	4
Definitely give this place a try! Even though this place is quite small, the crepes and scrumptious pastries make up for it. If this place was a little closer to where I live, I would make this place a weekly morning visit for a joyful cup of coffee along with a try on each pastry. I do look forward to see more options to be added along with the crepe variety. This place also makes cakes for those special occasions. Will try the cake selections next time an occasion comes up.	5	SUZUYA Pastries & Crepes	4.5
This restaurant needs a better location. Outside of the restaurant looks terrible with limited parking spaces available. You'll miss this spot if you don't pay attention. It seems more like a business office being located right next to a gas station. Inside though is entirely a different story. It has a grwat atmosphere for a chinese restaurant. Seems to be more classy than a typical chinese restaurant. Great furniture and several large TVs set around with chinese decorations. This is what a chinese restaurant should look like, which reminds me of family when I went here. This place most likely is set for large groups or family as there are many large tables. The menu comes with many pictures that go along what the dishes look like. They have some high end dishes that you can order as well. The food here is good. Though, the 'Hot and Sour Soup' did not suit my taste. I felt that this soup consists of too much black pepper or something was wrong as I did not find it to be any good. Then, the bean soup dessert at the end was not any good either. Usually at other chinese restaurants they serve it as hot, but this restaurant serves it cold which I felt it was not fresh or spectacular. Yet, it is still definitely a place worth a try, and a place I would come back to.	4	Bund Shanghai	3.5
"I used to come here often but it is starting to slowly change on their offers. The food and service is great, but the place no longer feels the same.

Things on the menu no longer offer everything they used to have. I went in Monday night 10:00PM and was told that they do not have a happy hour when it was sitting on our table that specified 3-5PM & 10-12PM. The happy hour menu barely had any items on it as most were taken off and they covered it with ""DISCONTINUED."" I've also noticed that they do not have sushi rolls on their menu anymore. Even though on their website still listed a wider selection of items that I looked forward to enjoy, but feel disappointed when stepping inside. 

Hope that they will fix the menu back to be better."	3	JINYA Ramen Bar	4
"I had just finished dinner nearby and was craving for something sweet. This place definitely fulfilled my satisfaction. This place is lovely with nice decor and  great ambience. 

LOCATION & HOURS:
It is located in the Southwest area across from the Smith's center and nearby the Windmill Library. They open late till 1am which is great when I need to stay out late at night, this place makes good place to hang out. 

THINGS ORDERED:

Matcha Espresso Latte - The drink looks amazing as they layer it with espresso on the bottom and matcha on top. I am a coffee addict and the flavor was nice and strong without being overly sweet. Just the way I like it :)

Taiyaki - I got it with red bean filling with green tea ice cream and topped it with mochi with two big marshmallows inside. This is my first experience with this type of dessert so I was not so sure on how to devour it lol. But I deconstructed mines and I loved the texture of the fish shaped breading. Had a nice touch of crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Strawberry Banana Egglett - I always enjoy these yummy egg shaped looking waffles and I was impressed with the flavor and nice presentation. 

Will definitely be back to try their different selection of tea and boba drinks!"	5	Cafe Summer	4
We used the Groupon offer and without the Groupon we would have been less than satisfied.  We started out with the French Onion soup, very very rich.  Unlike any French Onion soup we have had before, and we tend to always try this at new restaurants.  It was so rich that my wife couldn't finish hers.  For lunch I had the burger and it was just that a burger, it didn't wow me.  My wife had the chicken sandwich and it was just that, a chicken breast on a bun.  Great beer selection though.  I think I would return if I was in the mood for a wide selection of beer, but I will be staying away from eating here again.	3	Public House	3.5
I agree, I really don't get all of the negative reviews.  It was exactly what I expected.  Not high end mexican (if that even exists), but good mexican food.  We had the Groupon and had no issues with it.  It seems everyone having an issue with it doesn't read the instructions on how to use it based on the number of people.  We had the Cadillac nachos for an appetizer and the waitress explained that they were individually portioned nachos.  So everyone complaining, maybe you should know what you are ordering.  They were great.  For entres we had the enchiladas and no complaints.  So if you are looking for a decent place on the strip, this place foots the bill.	4	Cabo Wabo Cantina	3.5
"For the TS (Town Square) Location:

Came in with a party of 5 and was seated right away. It was extremely busy for a Monday night so you know the place is desirable. Inside looks amazing, has a nice  white bar and table tops with gorgeous chandeliers down the back wall. We got an Almond Joy martini,a S'mores martini, Blue Ocean Goblet and a Passion Punch Goblet as well as a classic Margarita. SO GOOD!! all this drinks were very tasty (their specialty) 

For apps we got the baked brie, popcorn shrimp and a bruschetta and two of the girls got french onion soup to start; all of which were amazing! Usually bruschetta  and french onion soups are hit or miss, well Sugar Factory's TS were definitely A HIT.

Next came a Tuna Melt, Tuna Tuscan Salad,Bleu Cheese Bacon Burgers and the best grilled cheese sandwich ever, had 4 different cheeses in it! 

Plus they have candy, lollipops and merchandise you can purchase before you leave!

The food was great and the service was well above anything else I've experienced at Yard House or Brio. Would definitely recommend to any local or tourist in Town Square for the day, GO TO SUGAR FACTORY TOWN SQUARE, so good!!! A+"	5	Sugar Factory	3.5
This place was great! Mexican doesnt seem too attractive for Brunch but our party of 4 really enjoyed it! Rachel was our server,AMAZING experience. She helped us by explaining how the all you can eat brunch worked, as well as giving us the low down on what was the best plates. Will definitely return! THANKS GUYS	5	Border Grill	4
Best food around!!!! Garbage Salad,Special Meatballs, and a Cookie Explosion shake: perfection!!	5	Meatball Spot	2.5
Which which is bomb! Definitely suggest this place to anyone! Come in,choose which sandwich you'd like by selecting the coinciding bag. On the bag has your options (cheese,topping,condiments,etc),mark them off and hand it to the line and you're set. Got the pesto chicken with feta and pesto sauce, deliciousness!	5	Which Wich Superior Sandwiches	3.5
Killer happy hour here,beats any one else! Little pricey for the quality\/service at regular price but great selection of beers. Me gusta!	4	Yard House	4
I like this place. Especially since they have half off when you present a players card and local ID. Been twice,first time I got the filet which was very very tiny. If it was full price ($31) I would have been upset. The second time I ordered the Steak Frites. Best deal there hands down. Both were cooked to perfection but the filet was a ripoff. Good food and even better service. Both times I got a short haired smoking blonde,I think her name was Kendra. She was awesome! Always on top of it! Give it a solid B on food and A+ on service!	4	S+O Restaurant	3
Great place to catch the games! Ashley P took great care of us both times we were in! Definitely coming back!	5	Blondies Sports Bar & Grill	2.5
"I've been here twice and both a day apart from each other.

First Trip I got the Shoyu (Soy Sauce) Ramen.  It's the most basic and simple menu you can get in Ramen and it really tells me how good each part of the Dish really can be.  Second trip had the Abura Soba (Soupless Ramen) Apparently new on the Specials menu. (Didn't see it on the first visit)  I haven't had Abura Soba a lot but again a simple ramen dish that uses simple ingredients so you really judge the chef's cooking technique with the ingredients.  (Everything here is locally grown)

Soup:  Simply put it was AWESOME....  Flavors are well blended.  Probably a combination of Chicken Stock with Fish Stock.  Had a robust flavor with a little bitterness from the veggies in the stock. (the balance is exquisite)  I wish it came a little more hotter (Tempurature) but I'm used to the soup to be burn your tongue hot.  

Noodles:  Cooked perfectly.  Uses the Standard Straight noodles used in Tonkotsu (Pork Broth) Noodles.  I'm used to the Shoyu Ramen to come with the standard wavy Egg Noodles but the straight noodles worked.  

Note: The Abura Soba came with the Wavy Egg Noodles so it really captured all the dry ingredients.  Again cooked to perfection.

Ingredients:  You can add your own favorite toppings but all Ramen comes standard with Green Onions, Menma (Bamboo Shoot) and Chashu (Roasted Pork).  The Chashu was just awesome and it came slightly charred so it really brought out extra flavor.

Staff:  They are the best part of the entire experience.  They were very polite, attentive and most of all knowledgeable with everything on the menu.  They are very well trained and really made the experience a wonderful one.

I will be back to see how much better this place can be."	5	Shoku Ramen	3.5
"Service was poor. Waiter was fine but the lobster was under cooked (raw) and the manager did little (IE nothing) to correct this. Additionally the lobster meat was sparse, like the lobster had been sitting a while and eating its own flesh due to starvation. 

Also, ordered a cocktail ""neat"" and they charged for 1.5 shots (something about how neat comes with more and therefore (Casino rules) they must charge more). Didn't ask for a double, asked for a single but got charged for a double. Again, manager had nothing of value to say about this. 

Will not return. Expect more and deserve more (paid nearly 200 a head after wine, so it's not like we went cheap)."	2	Lakeside	3.5
The great thing about this place is that they are open 24 hours. The best time to go is breakfast, rather than late night. We went late night and it took about 40 minutes to get our meal. The prices are ridiculously high, but it's super convenient for people staying at TI.	3	The Coffee Shop	2.5
We tried babaganoush and ezme as appetizers. Then we had "doner" that was the kind you can see everywhere in Turkey. We topped it off with baklava. Overall it is awesome.	5	Maza Mediterranean Grill & Lounge	4
This place is excellent! Very old fashioned with great old fashioned's. Live much every night which a treat and some of the best pasta I've ever had. Try the leftovers.	5	Capo's Italian Cuisine	4
This place was our first stop for our weekend vegas getaway. The ambience was good, low light, not a lot of energy so it was a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of the vegas casino floor. Service was mediocre but the food was delicious. I had the combination of tacos; carne asada, chicken and carnitas. The carnitas taco was my favorite with pickled red onion, chopped orange, and the moist and tender carnitas. The chica got a trio of carne asada tacos which were delicious. The only had one corn tortilla for each taco so you weren't getting a mout full of tortilla each bit. Each plate came with rice and beans ehich weren't bad but nothing to brag about. Salsas were good and the chips were airy and not heavily drenched in oil. ***WARNING- they charge $3 for chips and salsa*** but they don't tell you when they say, "we'll be right back with your drinks, and chips and salsa". I'm not gonna cry over three bucks in Vegas but hidden charges irk me, and no it's not even on the menu. Probably won't go back as there are so many places to go in Vegas and it wasn't one of those Epic meals that you have to have again.	3	T&T - Tacos & Tequila	3.5
I love Casa Don Juan, Its a great place to eat delicious Tamales and Tacos. Depending on what day and\/or time you go, it'll be a hit or miss. More than often its great, but on those bad days its just average. For the newbie, I would recommend the Tamale and Taco Combo! The Beef Fried Taco is the BOMB and the Cheese and jalapeno Tamale is so delicious. I feel its all up to who the cook is that day and how busy they are.	4	Casa Don Juan  - Downtown	4
Find this place because there is over 4000 reviews in yelp, the food is good not too fancy especially for the breakfast . If you would like sit outside you have to wait , its first come first service policy, reservation only for inside, but sitting outside is much nicer!	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
Great breakfast . Went back the next day. Prices were fare and the service and food was very good.	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"My favorite steak place to go to when I visit vegas. Right in my favorite hotel, there lies botero right around the corner. Easy to make reservations for a date. Nice staff.

The food: Love the ahi tuna tartare, but I'm not a mango person so I wish they took that part out. I just pick them out.
- I got the petite filet because my stomach is tiny. Can barely finish this plate. But the meat was nice and soft, juicy and cooked to perfection. It came with three different dipping sauces which was great; a different taste with each bite you take.
- Side dishes: a must get is the truffle macaroni and cheese. The best macaroni and cheese I have ever had in the whole entire world! I could eat this as my entree.

well that's my two cents. love the starter bread and the amuse-Bouche. yums"	5	Botero	4
Review for the sushi bar only. The fish quality was average at best. Every roll is deep fried so if you want to enjoy the taste of the fish and enjoy true sushi this is not the place for you, BUT if you like novelty rolls that are mostly deep fried you will enjoy it. Just not what I expected.	2	Musashi Japanese Steakhouse	4
"got a calzone ($8.50) a slide of pizza ($5.50) an order of 10 pieces of wings ($8.99) and a fountain drink ($2.50) (refill .54 cents)

Wings were crispy from the outside but the meat was just too dry!!!! And pizza was too salty!!! And the calzone was mediocre at best. only reason it's getting any stars is cause of the service. which was pretty stellar. won't be coming here anytime soon."	2	Tower Pizzeria	3.5
I was not impressed at all with the Wynn's buffet.  I admit, the dessert area was cool, but food-wise?  I expected better.  One of the main things I wanted to try was the lamb chops.  Unfortunately, it wasn't as tasty as I expected.  No flavor, needs more salt and a bit overcooked.  But Im sure they rather over cook then undercook for health reasons.  Heck, lamb chops from Costco tasted better.  Thank goodness our large group didn't have to wait in line because one of our friends went around the hotel asking for line passes and low and behold, he got them!   Mind you I'm not saying it's terrible, but I expected better.  Bellagio and the buffet at the former Alladin still rank higher in my mind.	3	The Buffet	3.5
"It was my first time at Spearmint Rhino and it did not disappoint.
Previously I had only been to Sapphire which is huge compared to this place.  I preferred the layout at Rhino.  Much more intimate and it was very lively.  I was amazed at the variety of girls.  They were everywhere.  Needless to say it was an eye opening experience.  I met a Lucy Liu look-alike who fell in love with one of her clients, who's from Italy and is getting married in a few months - congrats to her.  I met a half Korean half Chinese girl who use to be a translator but makes more $$ dancing.  Then there was the Japanese girl from Hawaii who grabbed me for a lap dance but took me away from where I was sitting because some people she knew back in high school were sitting nearby and recognized her and she felt weirded out.  Haha....good times, good times..."	4	Spearmint Rhino Las Vegas	3.5

Wait was not long, service wasn't bad. However I did have to send back my burger (double decker) three times before I simply wanted a refund. The first time was because I ordered my burger with no onions and no pickles, and they put onions on it. Second time was when they brought it and it was almost ice cold (they probably left it next to a fridge?) girl was super nice & understanding so she sent it back again. And third was when it made me sick. The double decker has two meat patties and one of them was cooked the other was completely RAW. You can see for yourself in the pictures. Manager or whoever was super nice. Took my burger out of the check and gave us a discount on our whole ticket as well as offered free dessert. The rating is for the food. Before you take a bite, check your burger.	1	Wahlburgers	3.5

My wife and I love coming to Therapy everytime we're in Vegas. We usually stay downtown so it's a quick and easy walk from our hotel. Blake and Shannon have taken care of us several times and they are great always recommending the best bites to eat and of course the best drinks. They are the main reason we keep coming back. I highly recommend coming to Therapy whenever you're in town.	5	Therapy	4
Great concept and super friendly service. This was my first time here and the girl working were was so helpful and patient explaining everything to me. You have the option of ordering one of the many choices off the menu or you can create your own sushi burrito "Chipotle style" by going down the line and telling the employee what\/how you want your burrito fixed. I picked the "3 amigos" off of the menu and it was delicious. It was also very filling which is my biggest gripe with sushi, I'm always hungry and hour or two after I eat it but this time I was still full almost 4 hours later.	5	Soho SushiBurrito	4.5
Great cinnamon rolls! You can either get the mini rolls, which for us was enough for 1 person or you can get the bigger rolls which 2 or 3 people can easily share. The rolls are sweet but not too sweet which is a sign of a great roll. I can't stand rolls that are drenched in frosting and are too sweet to eat but these are just right. They also serve food here but I can't comment on that, we just came here for the rolls and we will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas.	5	Homie's Cinnamon Rolls and Comfort Cafe	4.5
I got the Irish skillet and my wife got the pancake combo.  Both meals were very delicious!   The pictures look great but the taste is even better.   The wait staff and atmosphere are great 5\/5	5	Jamms Restaurant	4.5
"This Las Vegas buffet is permeated with familiar comfort foods prepared in the freshest manner exploiting the finest ingredients. With more than 500+ dishes to choose from daily, every guest is sure to satiate their immense craving at Bacchanal, whether it's one for prime rib, chilled king crab legs that are already cut for you, grilled lamb chop, made to order tacos, and baked-to-order pastries. 

It represented the decadence of a Roman feast set within a fine dining atmosphere. Super chic environment with Sparta theme surrounded by the Greek goddesses or Roman emperors for a huge feast. I've been to Wicked Spoon, The Carnival Buffet, Wynn Buffet, and many others in Las Vegas. This one didn't impress me to an extend. I had super high expectation but it didn't exceed it. I guess all the hype isn't just a bluff. I will have to pass on this one but this deserves 4 stars."	4	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"I must say.... it's a pretty decent price to pay for something better than your local Hometown Buffet.

"TAO nightclub lives up for Vegas. 

I got in for free, and got free drinks as well?? As much as I want! The bouncer was nice enough to provide me VIP drinks with the tickets he handed me. I have no idea how I got this, lol. Great music. As a clubber vulture, I live up for this one. This is my 2nd club in Vegas and I had an amazing time. The Asian decors are super astonishing. 

I will probably come back here when I'm back to Sin City."	5	Tao Nightclub	3
"Amazing 'secret' place in Cosmo! It's on the third floor of the building (you're welcome) and has no signs! It's right next to Zuma, if that helps. There is a long hallway full of old school ads\/artwork toward Secret Pizza. The reason being it secret because it isn't on the directory. But it isn't a secret anymore with over three thousand reviews!! 

They have the white sauce, red sauce and Sicilian pizza (which they ran out). I had a first bad impression about their pizza as soon as I saw the pizza laying on the counter that looks old and pale... but I was wrong, they heat them up for you in the hot oven before serving. Did I mention that this was the CHEAPEST MEAL in VEGAS?! 2 slices for about $6. CRISPY, gooey cheese, THIN CRUST, and simply delicious... I can imagine myself here at 4AM (they open until really late) after a drunk night. 

Probably one of my highlight meals in Vegas. A SUPER MUST TRY!"	5	Secret Pizza	4
"I can't believe I just found this gem! 

I ordered the bun bo hue, beef pho, and a chicken pate chaud. All of their food items were flavorful, and had the perfect amount of noodle to meat to soup ratio. I'm very picky with my bun bo hue, and for the first time I could taste the lemon grass flavor. Hands down, this place makes the best bun bo hue in Las Vegas! On the other hand, the beef pho was basic and tasted like any other Vietnamese restaurant's pho. Nothing too special to rave about but still good nonetheless. 

What makes this place so unique is the bakery part of the restaurant. There was only a few pastries left, so I went with the chicken pate chaud and fell in love! It was a perfect combination of savory, flakey, and chewy goodness.

Can't wait to come back to try the other noodle soups and pastries!"	5	So Good Cafe	4.5
"I'm obsessed with buffets and AYCE, and Red Pot is definitely on my TOP 5 favorite AYCE places in Las Vegas because: 1) they have seafood, 2) they have sliced meat, 3) they have veggie, 4) they have soup, and 5) WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED IN LIFE?!

Food: you start off with choosing two broths that are set up ying-yang style at your table. I highly recommend the sour tomato because it's flavorful enough to eat with your food and drink with your noodles, yet not overpowering. We also got the  Mongolian herbal broth but that was way too plain, it tasted like water soaked in some of the basic veggies from the fridge. Red Pot offers a vast variety of seafood (from clams to fish balls), pork\/lamb shoulder\/beef\/chicken slices in the freezer, and vegetables (from bamboo to bok choy). Plus, two counters worth of sauces to mix a concoction to your taste. 

Price: my parents and I were so impressed with how cheap it was because we definitely ate our money's worth and more. It's $22 per person for lunch and 10% off for checking in Yelp. Dinner is $35 per person and 15% off discount with Yelp. If you think AYCE sushi or kbbq is great, TRY HOT POT! 

Service: the service was mediocre. I had to ask for my drink to be refilled twice, and they never check on us; keep in mind, only four other tables were occupied besides us and my group came right at 11 AM. Luckily, the food in the fridges\/freezers were always stocked, and everything seemed clean and not cluttered --so that's a plus!

Overall: HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Now that the weather is getting colder, hot pot is the best way to enjoy a meal with family and friends. It's affordable, delicious, and a fun hands-on lunch or dinner experience. I'm taking 1 star away because some of their items were super frozen and not the freshest, and their soup choices are disappointing."	4	The Red Pot	3.5
"I ordered the $11.99 special (unlimited breadsticks and salad\/soup with a choice of pasta as the main course) and it was truly disappointing. 

Maybe I came on a bad day, but my pasta was very bland and flavorless. The server only came by twice to check on us, and overall I felt rushed even though it was not busy. 

Note: when they say unlimited breadsticks\/salads\/soups, they will only give you 2 breadsticks and a small soup\/salad at a time... My friend and I waited almost 50 minutes for our food, so of course we would be asking for breadsticks and salads every 10 minutes. Our server looked at us like we were crazy every time we asked for more of the unlimited appetizers. I looked around and other tables received bad service too, one couple even got up and waked away."	2	Olive Garden Italian Restaurant	3.5
"AYCE sushi is equivalent to the happiest place on earth for me. I can't believe this was my first time here because they have so many appetizer, nigiri, and roll options. I'm seriously so impressed! 

Sushi: great quality seafood. The fish to rice ratio is fair and not as generous as Sushi Neko, but the quality makes up for it. I tried the salmon, tuna, fresh scallop (A MUST), sweet shrimp, uni, oysters, and eel. Their appetizers are the best I've ever had at an AYCE sushi restaurant. I had ahi poke, shrimp tempura (crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside), and mussels. The mussels were the worse because it wasn't creamy or flavorful enough. 

Desserts: AMAZING! They have more than your usual ice creams and mochi ice creams, like a variety of creme brûlées, tiramisu, etc. The green tea creme brûlée was more like a flavored whip cream in my opinion; I like mine more thick and creamy but still sweet and good nonetheless. 

Service: Kenny was our server and he was fantastic. It was super busy when we came in, but he still found time to be attentive and catered to us. He made conversation, suggestions when we were hesitant and deciding on what to order, and my favorite items were from his recommendations. Thanks for not judging me when I ordered like 10 items as my first order lol. 

Overall: Oyshi is on my top 5 AYCE sushi restaurants. I can't complain with great service and quality fish. I'll definitely be back!"	5	Oyshi Sushi	3.5
"MIND BLOWN!

I am so impressed with how delicious, fluffy, and chewy their donut are. I bought the cake batter, blueberry cheesecake, Nutella, samoa, Homer's donut, and the red velvet donuts. 

I came in around 11 AM during their soft opening and there were quite a few good choices left. Unfortunately the strawberry split & Oreo one was sold out  but that's okay because what I got was tasty! 

Donut Bar compared to other donut shops around town is their HUGE donuts ($4 each), and unique ones like the Oreo inside the donut, the pop tart inside the donut, and hopefully the donut cones soon (well that's what they advertised on their Instagram). The dough is exceptionally chewy, moist, the toppings are even & proportionate, and most importantly the frosting isn't overly sweet. 

I definitely recommend this place, just come early so you have more options!"	5	Donut Bar	4.5
"If y'all know me I am a huge seafood lover, and this is a long, over due review lol. 

FOOD: On point every time. First, I cannot stress enough on how fresh their crawfish is and how consistently tender the meat is. I've also had their mussels, clams, crab legs, and shrimp and they were all consistently juicy, tender, and delicious. I never have to worry about whether the seafood item I want is in season or not because I trust that they serve the freshest ingredients every time. Next, the sauce and spice level! For seasoning, you can choose from: Louisiana, juicy cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper, and hot n juicy; for spice level, you can choose from: baby spice, mild, medium, spicy, and extra spicy. I recommend ordering the crawfish, shrimp, and mussels by the pound with either the hot n juicy or garlic butter sauce at mild level, white rice, and sweet potato or cajun fries. 

SERVICE: I prefer this Hot n' Juicy location over the others because it's the cleanest and conveniently located next to Bambu. All the servers are usually friendly, but I have to give a shout out to Max K. He is always attentive, friendly, and personable. I generally know what I want to order, but he makes the extra effort to suggest other items without pressuring me; tip: the oysters are large and juicy, so I highly recommend that if you're into raw oysters. If you're a new customer or returning customer, and got Max as your server, just know that you're in good hands and will receive a fantastic dining experience!

OVERALL: I highly recommend this place if you're down for a messy and juicy experience. Buying seafood buy the pound, getting your fingers dirty, wearing a bib, and drinking an ice cold beer is the best way to enjoy a family style meal if you ask me."	5	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
"This is where the old Arby's use to be. 

They have a variety of food and desserts from DQ and Grill & Chill. 

DQ: Classic treats like sundaes, banana splits, and cones. Blizzards, desserts a la mode, frappes, shakes, and malts. They also have Orange Julius smoothies.

Grill & Chill: hot sandwiches, chicken strips, salads, $5 lunch specials (11 am to 4 pm), hot dogs, burgers, and a kids meal. 

I only got the desserts and they tasted fine. I came in during a slow day so they were really quick with my order. Nothing to complain. I'll definitely be back to try the burger & fries menu."	4	Dairy Queen	2.5
"TACOS
I am not sure what the hype is about because it's definitely A-OK. I ordered a rotisserie taco and slow cooked & smoked pork taco; both had cilantro, onions, mild salsa, and some sorta of cheese. The meat itself are flavorless, dry, and drenched in juices that made the tortilla super soggy and fall apart. The only pro was that they were generous with the amount of meat so I was full with 2 tacos.

SERVICE
It was empty on a Saturday afternoon, so I didn't have to wait to order. The same girl who took and made my order also checked me out at the register. She was nice, made suggestions, and tried to engage in a convo so I appreciate it.

AMBIANCE
Very modern, plenty of seatings, and wood themed. 

OVERALL
I probably won't return because the tacos are not as flavorful compared to other places, and are somewhat overpriced."	3	Tacos Huevos	5
"I grew up eating Vietnamese food, so I can taste the difference between good and bad bun bo hue.

The main reasons why I gave this place a one star was because: 
1. The service was terrible. I was not greeted at the door or at the table until I got someone's attention 10 minutes later. Yes I did sit myself because I thought that was the norm, and yes I came in during business hours. Maybe they were playing hide-and-go seek with me. Who knows. 

2. Perhaps they were trying to be hip, but the room was really dark... The only bright light came from the kitchen. 

3. All the items on the menu were quite pricey compared to the Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown 

4. I ordered the bun bo hue and received a few pieces of meat, noodle, soup, and bean sprouts. Keep in mind that bun bo hue should have banana root\/blossom or at least red cabbage on the side, beef shank, pig's feet and pig's blood cubes inside the the soup.

You are better off making 10 cent ramen at home. If you want good Vietnamese food, go to Chinatown."	1	Viet Bistro	3.5
"They are ALWAYS busy and there is at least 6 cars in drive-thru no matter what time of day it is, but it's worth the wait! 

Indeed, their menu is limited but the burgers are really good. The beef patty is thick and juicy, the lettuce and tomatoes are fresh and never limp, and the In-and-Out sauce completes the meal. Keep in mind that you can personalize your burger, like protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun) or animal style (extra spread with grilled onions on top).

I always get a double double with cheese and animal style fries."	5	In-N-Out Burger	4
"DRINKS: Sunrise Coffee serves traditional espresso drinks (latte, cappuccino, americano, etc.) and teas. What makes them different is the quality of their coffee beans and flavor options. For lattes, my favorite syrups are the creme brûlée, orange mocha, and truffle berry with either rice milk or almond milk. For herbal teas, I like the south pacific iced because it's fruity and perfect for the summer! 

FOOD: Vegan and gluten free options are available! Sunrise Coffee serves fresh pastries every morning (muffins, scones, croissant, and cookies). Their muffins are huge and my favorites are the banana nut muffin and strawberry lemon muffin. Lastly, they have a great breakfast\/lunch menu --I recommend the alien burrito because of the tomato basil tortilla and unique mixture of couscous, hummus, and various vegetables. 

OVERALL: Aesthetically pleasing decor with both indoor and outdoor seating. It's generally 2\/3 packed (with people) inside, but there is never a line when I go in so that's a plus."	5	Sunrise Coffee	4.5
"They have improved a lot since the last time I came here. 

First, their boba is consistently hot and chewy (this was my biggest complaint last time). Second, their milk teas have a distinct, strong tea flavor (similar to Brew Tea) and not powdery or too milky. Third, they give you the option to pick black tea or green tea when ordering flavored milk teas, like taro for example, for people who have a preference (mine is usually green tea). Overall, I am very impressed with the quality of tea, the new food items like pork rice and curry rice, and most importantly I appreciate their 32 oz large cup."	4	Tea Space	4.5
"Outback Steakhouse has really good steak and appetizers but for some reason the food at this location doesn't taste the same as other Outbacks; the portions seem small, and the food doesn't taste as fresh or come out hot. I came here twice and both times the Bloomin' Onion was too soggy and salty. I honestly prefer the West Sahara location over this one.  

During multiple occasions, they say ""It seems like you need a few more minutes, I will be right back."" Maybe they were all trained to say that, but I personally like when servers recommend food and tell me what is the most popular at least."	3	Outback Steakhouse	3
"They have the BEST Vietnamese sandwiches in Las Vegas. Hands down.

I've been to many Vietnamese restaurants that specialize in banh mi sandwiches, and this restaurant has perfected it. The bread is crunchy\/flakey on the outside and soft\/chewy on the inside. And they are very generous with the pickled veggies and various meats too. 

Best of all, they are cheap, only $3.25+tax for any banh mi sandwich and they are located across the street from UNLV. I recommend the classic grilled pork banh mi."	4	Pho Thanh Huong	4
"I'm not exactly sure what yunnan food is, but I'm very impressed. Their portions are quite large and everyone at our table had extra to take home. 

I got the rice noodle in hot and sour soup. It was flavorful with just the perfect amount of spices. It is hard to explain, you'll have to taste it yourself because of how unique it is. My sister got the braised beef noodle soup and she said the broth was also flavorful and not too salty. The beef was tender and melts on your tongue. Both dishes came with a generous amount of vegetables. 

Their service was amazing, they were attentive, and the food came out fast. No complaints here."	4	Noodle King	4
"I don't normally write reviews for fast food restaurants, but this location makes the best Classic Buttery Jack!

The sandwich features a seasoned 1\/4-lb. beef patty topped with melted garlic herb butter, a slice of provolone cheese, creamy tomato sauce, green leaf lettuce, tomato, and a new ""signature"" bun. Other places make it mediocre but this location always give me a steaming warm bun, juicy hot patty, and just put everything together so well (unlike some places who just slap it together and make it not snapchat\/Instagram worthy). 

Seriously, this new bun is OUT OF THIS WORLD! It's similar to a brioche bun or Bachi Burger Buns."	4	Jack In the Box	3
"I've reviewed quite a few coffee shops, and PublicUs comes to mind whenever I am recommending a great coffee shop in Las Vegas. I don't live anywhere near downtown but I will make the 30-40 minute drive for their delicious brunch options, hipster coffee, and earthy decor. 

FOOD: I've only had their brunch so I can't say much about their dinner items. All their food options are instagram worthy, especially the toasts with the fruits and vegetable mixture on top. I recommend the smashed avo toast, eggs benedict, and smoked salmon toasts. 

PASTRIES: I have a huge sweet tooth so pastries are always on my mind. They serve a wide variety of scones, muffins, croissants, etc. and it's always different. I've tried the blueberry cream cheese scone (super soft and moist), strawberry brownie cookie (chewyAF but still moist), mixed berry muffin (the best muffin that you will ever eat in your life), and they are ALL DELICIOUS. 

COFFEE\/DRINKS: They serve the traditional expresso drinks (latte, americano, cappuccino, etc.), iced coffee, iced tea, hot tea, and specials (like sodas). I am in love with their old fashioned coffee, macadamia nut latte, and lemon lime green tea. FYI, the baristas are always on point with their latte art --very impressive. 

AMBIANCE: They have wooden table tops\/chairs, a big tree in the middle of the room, and an overall earthy vibe that is refreshing. I love the large windows, spacious seating, and appreciate the small knick knack toys everywhere. 

OVERALL: If you're looking for a perfect spot to relax, enjoy delicious coffee, and eat a hipster brunch, then this is your go-to cafe."	5	PublicUs	4.5
"You can't go wrong with a build your own curry with toppings, rice, and spice level. 

FOOD
The dish consists of rice, curry sauce, and options for different spice levels, proteins, and toppings. Super simple yet so delicious! I always order chicken katsu, croquette, and deep fried shrimps with a level 3 sauce. They also have side dishes, including my favorites: takoyaki, karaage, fried oysters, fried gyoza, and curry udon. 

OVERALL
The price to portion size is fair, the service is quick (even though there's usually a 10-15 minute wait to be seated), and the Japanese curry sauce is very flavorful."	4	Japanese Curry Zen	4.5
"This restaurant offers the tastiest and most authentic Vietnamese food in Las Vegas. I grew up eating Vietnamese food everyday and this place reminds me of home. They offer a variety of noodle, rice, spring rolls, salads, hotpot dishes and more. Plus I am a sucker for mom and pops restaurants, and the owner is very nice. 

Food: More than your usual Vietnamese spot. They have hot and sour catfish soup and clay pot dishes, which I have never seen at other Vietnamese restaurants. I've been here a few times and ordered to-go as well. I recommend the hot and sour soup with catfish (they also have shrimp if you don't like that fishy taste). It has a perfect combination of tangy, sweet and sour flavors. I also recommend the bun bo hue and bun rieu. Both were very delicious, true to their traditional ingredients\/flavors, and just an interesting alternative to your usual pho noodle soups. 

Service: It is still new so every time I've went there were only 1-2 other tables. It's a mom and pops type restaurant, so the same man takes care of us every time. He is friendly, efficient, on top with refilling water, and checked on our table several times. The decor has a true Vietnamese vibe with the magenta walls, bamboo decorations, and they play Vietnamese music\/shows on the big screen TV by the cashier. 

Overall: I've been choosing this place over the many Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown so that says something. My only complaint is that they are limited with desserts but that's okay because I need to lose weight anyway."	5	Sylantro Restaurant	4
"Maybe I am a little bias because they are from Hawaii, but the food here is so ono. 

This is a mom and pops restaurant and they have a wide range of Thai food, some with Hawaiian fusion. My favorite dishes are the papaya salad and pad thai with shrimp. If you check in or come during lunchtime you can get a free thai tea. The price is fair and the food is delicious. I can't complain. The best part is the complementary tapioca dessert. Mmmmhhhh so sweet and flavorful."	4	Plumeria Thai Cafe	4.5
"Bluefin is one my top ten sushi spots in Las Vegas. 

Although their AYCE menu isn't as good as other places in Chinatown, they are conveniently located near my school in Henderson so I can't complain. I love how their sushi is really fresh and thick. Although the rice to sushi ratio isn't the best (because let's be real, we all prefer more fish and less rice) the quality of fish is worth it.

Plus, they have an affordable lunch special menu that include a miso soup and chef salad with all the dishes. I always order the Sashimi Special Combo for 15.95. It is a 10 piece sashimi dish that includes: tuna, yellowtail, salmon, shrimp, white fish, miso soup, and house salad."	4	Blue Fin Sushi & Roll	4
"Feast Buffet is one of the few cheap buffets in Las Vegas that's actually good! 

FOOD: The overall quality of the food is decent. You get what you are paying for (regular price $19.99, player's card price $14.99). The buffet covers 9 different cuisines: Sushi and shrimp, American (mashed potatoes, meatloaf, fried chicken, etc.), BBQ, Italian (pizza & pasta), Mexican (tacos), Asian (the basic Chinese dishes, curry, tom yum soup, etc.), Farmer's market (salad bar, soup, and breads), and International (veggie burgers, humus, falafel), and a small dessert section. 

It's better than your average Station casino buffet and I do appreciate the variety. For example they offer tom yum soup in additional to the usual egg drop soup, and Indian curry in the Asian section. The only downfall would be the dessert section. Literally there were only 8 different desserts (various cupcakes, carrot cake, cookies, and sponge cakes), 4 sugar-free cakes, ice cream, and a peach cobbler\/bread pudding section. I wasn't impressed at all and majority of them were on the dryer side. 

OVERALL: When I'm tired of AYCE sushi and KBBQ I would come here to satisfy my AYCE cravings."	4	Feast Buffet	3.5
"My parents and I ordered the Chef's special ramen, curry ramen, and miso ramen. 

Out of the 3, I like the curry ramen the best. It was the most flavorful and had the best spices in the soup. The noodle to soup ratio was perfect, but I wish there was more substance - whether it be more vegetables or more meat. Something about the meal felt missing. Aside from that, the service was quick and we got our food within 10 minutes. The prices are decent, about $8 and up per bowl. 

Personally, there are better ramen places in town like Monta Ramen or Ramen Sora that have a more milky, unique tasting broth."	3	Homi-Ya Ramen	4
"The fish to rice ratio is amazing! You can't get any better than this in Las Vegas.

Everything tastes so fresh and their menu is huge. I love how unique everything is, like they have Hawaiian kalbi steak and ocean trout. The prices are $20.95 for lunch (open to 4 pm) and $25.95 for dinner (4 pm to close). The dessert items include the basic mochi ice cream & regular ice cream, in addition to green tea panna cotta, coffee blanc manger, mini honey toast, and tiramisu! 

My favorite things are the no rice items (sashimi roll & seafood salad), oyster, uni, tuna, and salmon."	5	Sushi Neko	4
"I don't normally come to a mall to enjoy good food, but the Fashion Show Mall finally has quality food in their food court! Every mall has a Panda Express as their ""ethnic"" food, but for once another culture is represented. 

My friend usually orders my Indian food for me, but since I was alone I didn't know what to order. Monica was really nice and let me try 3 of their top curry sauces. I ended up ordering the palak paneer because it was the lightest in taste; it wasn't too spicy but has the perfect amount of flavor. 

Palak paneer is a vegetarian Indian dish consisting of spinach, tomato gravy sauce and paneer in a thick paste made from puréed spinach and seasoned with garlic, garam masala, and other spices. My dish came with firm tofu pieces, rice, and a HUGE naan. 

Overall: the food was delicious, the portion was fair and worth the $11.99, and the customer service was great!"	4	India Masala	4
"I was super stoked when I heard about Chubby Cattle because 1) I love hotpot and 2) I love conveyor belts (come on, we are already cooking our own food, who is trying to do cardio walking up and down to the fridge while eating?! Am I right? Lol) 

Food: Chubby Cattle has a big menu with beautiful platted seafood and meat options. They also have noodles, vegetables, mushrooms, etc. on their menu. Their conveyor belt is also very impressive and I saw taro pieces to seafood to various greens. My brother and I ordered the tomato and seafood broth, and honestly I found them both very bland and flavorless. The seafood was very watered down and tasted like the seasoning from ramen packets (I read from other reviews that the mushroom and house special broths were also bland). The tomato broth was much better and probably the only broth I'll consider ordering if I come back. We also ordered the seafood platter, beef brisket (because my fave beef tongue was sold out), and vegetable noodles. The seafood consisted of muscles, scallops, shrimps, clams, and octopuses. Both the seafood and brisket dish were very fresh and did not seem frozen beforehand. 

Service: Mathew was our server and he was amazing. He answered all our questions, made suggestions, refilled our waters twice without us asking, cleaned up our table as soon as one of our plates were empty, and got our ice creams quickly. While all the servers seem stressed and all over the place, I found that our server kept his cool and smiled whenever he passed by. Thank you Mathew!

Overall: I'll definitely come back because the prices of the conveyor belt items were fair (ranging from .99 cents and up), the meat and seafood platters were great quality, and it was just a great experience to enjoy with family and friends. Hopefully they add more soup options or at least perfect their other ones because it sucks when the soup bases are so bland."	4	Chubby Cattle	4.5
There are many juice bars popping up in Las Vegas, but I always find myself coming back to Bowlology. They are consistent with their acai texture and flavor, the fruits are always fresh, and the employees are friendly and knowledgable. I usually get the Berry Good because I like the classic strawberry, blueberry, granola and honey toppings. Sometimes I spice it up and order the Chocolate Dream or Bear Bowl for the added protein and peanut butter flavor. In addition, they also have many other items like pitaya bowls, poke bowls, smoothies, fresh squeezed juices, coffee, and salads. If you're trying to eat healthier and incorporate more fruits & veggies in your diet, I highly recommend this place!	4	Bowlology	4
"I've never tasted and experience such unique pasta options in my life! 

I am impressed with how many types of noodle they offer, the various sauces, and the overall menu selection. For noodles, they have the basic spaghetti and fettuccine, as well as interesting ones like butternut squash and spinach ravioli. For the sauces, they have red, pink, green, creamy white, and seafood. Plus specialities pastas, a kids menu, and desserts! 

Best of all, they have a lunch special for $9.95 that includes a noodle and sauce of your choice, a drink, and garlic bread. Dine in or take out. You must try the fettuccine with the basil pesto creamy sauce."	5	Pastaidea	4.5
"There is no wow factor to this place. Yes there are many healthy options, but I don't think the presentation, taste, and overall price was worth it. I ordered the wellness drink and chopped salad (total: $20.00). With such simple ingredients, I didn't think they could screw up the taste, but they did. Probably won't return, sorry. 

There are many other options in Las Vegas like SkinnyFats, Grass Roots Juice Bar, and JuiceNGo that have similar options and taste better."	2	Greens and Proteins	4
"OBSESSED. Las Vegas has a handful of hot pot restaurants, and Pot Tea Social is definitely on my top three. 

Food: they have a total of 11 different pots, ranging from rib eye beef to lobster and even a veggie delight pot to cater to the vegans\/vegetarians. All their pots all filled with a delicious broth, various meats, various vegetables, and an option for steamed rice, minced pork or vermicelli on the side. If it's your first time, I highly recommend the rib eye beef pot with minced pork rice. That pot has a ton of stuff, like fish cake, tomatoes, cuttlefish ball, corn, quail egg, squid, etc. Don't be scared, all the flavors do go well together and it's literally the perfect meal for the fall\/winter season. The meat to soup ratio is great, I was able to eat a spoonful of food with my soup, without having an uneven balance of soup or meat\/veggie at the end. The minced pork is very unique because it's not too heavy but still juicy enough to eat with the ingredients in your soup. They also have appetizers like sweet potato fries, chicken wings, popcorn chicken, and deep fried stinky tofu. All around, it is a great fusion of Asian and American food. 

Service: I've been here for both lunch and dinner, and both times they were slow. The service is average and I can't say they are too personable because it depends on your server that day. They are quick with getting the food out and checking on you at least one to either refill your water or to turn off the fire. I have nothing to complain because they were nice and the restaurant is very clean. 

Overall: I took off a star because some of their broths could use more seasoning. I've only tried the rib eye beef pot, seafood & tofu pot, and Japanese miso pot. My friends and family have tried the others and they can be rather bland. All the pots are $11.99 each with exception of the lobster pot that is $19.99. It's on the pricer side in my opinion because the vegetables used are cheap and there are not enough meat in the pot to justify for $11.99. I recommend to try this place if you're new to eating hot pot or just want a small meal (and spend $7 more at an AYCE hot pot place for a real hot pot experience)."	4	Pot Tea Social House	4
"We had a party of 11. They seated us in a private room with one other table. It was very nice. We sat by the window, so you can see the busy streets of vegas. 

The food is quite good. I had halibut, and it was very yummy!!! The salmon was good as well. Most of the guys had steak, but i am not a big steak eater, so can't speak about the steak there. 

The waiter was very nice. He also give us a story about the expensive chandelier."	5	Morels French Steakhouse & Bistro	3.5
"Highlight of the night  *NO WAIT AND WALK RIGHT IN*

I gave one star for no waiting and one star for being spacy. 

We came on friday night and it's typical Asian invasion. We walked in and the decoration was kinda interesting. Budda everywhere. Budda was never a decoration in chinese culture, so it made one less star. The dance floor was small and people were pushy. toward mid night, it became unbelieveably crowded. 

The restroom was actually pretty nice."	2	Tao Nightclub	3
"This review is for the mushroom crepes only. It's a huge portion enough to feed 2. It was pretty good. They have a crepe station and they cook it in front of you. I would come back here again for the crepes only.

Didn't care too much for the pastries."	4	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
"This is based on the Mother's Day dinner menu. Supposedly they should be serving more seafood for this special day. They did add stone crab. However, no lobster were served!

I've been here before and sadly I have to say the quality of the meat went down. My favorite were the lamp chops (from last visit) but this time it was not seared properly :( and burgers were cold. Desserts were the best part.

My favorites:
Stone crab
Mexican corn
Duck
All of the desserts

As you can tell it's not worth it...$65.99 per person. Sorry Bacchanal, we won't be coming back anytime soon."	3	Bacchanal Buffet	4
This pizza place is awesome. New York giant slices...pinball...beer from a motorcycle helmet cause its vegas. The Evel Knievel stuff is fun. Come eat great pizza and play a 70s evel knievel pinball machine.	5	Evel Pie	4.5
"We had an awesome time eating at wicked spoon. Great selections with small portions so you can try more things. Food blew me away and i didnt get a pic. Desserts were awesome and i did get a pic of that plate. Line was long but moved super fast. A
We got there at 11 on presidents day. We were at our table by 11:20. My favorite part of the experience was our server - Hong. Hong did not stop helping us and going above and beyond. We got bottomless drinks and asked for mimosas. Hong doesn't bring traditional OJ but a different pink juice made in house. It was awesome. My wife's mimosa is getting empty as she goes for another plate...im told to ask hong for another. Before i can, he has her refill in hand and continues working hard. Hong really is awesome even during a busy overwhelming time. Thank you Wicked Spoon and Hong!"	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"Wow. I couldn't finish my lunch due to the things i watched. *Do not sit at live sushi station* if you do...you'll notice these things...
1. No gloves or hand washing took place. Touching raw fish, bottles, door knobs - no respect for the guest experience\/health.
2. Sushi dishes come with ginger and wasabi. Thats normal. Not here or at least not on our 3 plates of rolls. When we requested it, this guy stuck his hand into a metal tub of ginger, squeezed the juice of and plunked it onto the plate. I wouldnt eat that canned ginger if you threatened me.
3. We ordered 4 rolls when we came in. 3 came... another couple came in and ordered a ton of stuff. They got their whole order before we got our 4th roll and he hadn't forgotten. I asked cause i was ready to get out. 
4. Manager came behind to help and also didnt wash her hands or use gloves. 

Did i get sick after? Yes. Will i go back? No. Should you try it out? No. Do not buy a groupon for this place. Stay away."	1	Osaka Summerlin	2.5
This is one of my favorite restaurants to grab a steak in Vegas.     The food is top notch and is reasonably priced too. The Bordelaise steak in wine sauce with onions and frites is amazing, flavorful and is my go to dish when dining here (a close second is the Au Poivre Peppercorn steak). The service is always great, staff is attentive and the ambiance is perfect. Because of all that, I find myself always wanting to go back or taking friends who have yet to eat here. For great views of the strip and the Bellagio fountains, get a seat outside on the patio or inside near the windows.	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
Every time I come here I love it more and more! Attentive staff, casual but upscale atmosphere and beautiful scenery! The food has never let me down! Delicate flavors, plentiful portions, and refreshing beverages. Try to sit on the patio, its worth it!! Nothing is better than watching the Bellagio water show and eating a fantastic meal!	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
My cousin and I ate here for my birthday and had the most amazing meal and experience. We enjoyed a drink at the bar (best lemon drop of my life) before being escorted via elevator to our table on the second floor. We had a view of the entire restaurant and were very entertained by our hostess' recounting of the restaurant's décor and history. As fans of Gordon Ramsay, we were very pleased to be seated directly in front of the neon replica of his hand motions while creating his food. Our waiter and sommelier was incredible. We were very impressed by the cart of meat that was brought around for us to choose our cuts, and we were very pleased with the wine selections. Our food was beyond incredible. The steak didn't even need to be chewed as it was so tender and perfectly cooked. We enjoyed several appetizers (I suggest the asparagus, gnocchi, and the foie gras. Even the free bread was amazing! For dessert we ordered the signature Sticky Toffee Pudding and it was the perfect way to end an incredible experience. I cannot understand why people said that the restaurant was too loud - my cousin and I enjoyed great conversation and incredible food and drinks in a wonderful atmosphere. Some people are just too picky, and perhaps they should have made their reservation for the second floor, rather than on the main floor near the bar.	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
Hands down the best Mexican food I have eaten in Vegas since I moved here over 2 years ago. I ordered the carne asada taco (no guac or sour cream for me), cheese quesadilla and chips & salsa. The quesadilla was so cheesy and gooey... Omg it was so simple but so incredible. The carne asada tacos were perfect. The seasoning of the meat was spot on, the cheese was melty on the inside, the beans were soft not overly wet... It was an incredible taco. Even the chips and salsa were amazing! The salsa was their pico de gallo and it tasted so fresh and sweet, not damp and sour like so many places tends to. I really do not like pico de gallo under most circumstances, but I was all but licking my plate to get every bite. The only down side of the experience was the price - at over $15 for my few items, I was just pleased that the food lived up to the hype. If you haven't eaten here, do it. Do it now!!!	5	Los Tacos	4
"Incredible experience! My husband and I went for lunch and we were blown away by every minute! Our server was Daniel and he took such good care of us - I don't want to give too much of the experience away, but I will say that if you go into this with an open mind, you will no doubt have a great time. There is no question that you are dining in the absolute pitch dark, but the music and food actually distracts you from the fact that you can't see! 

I did see that some other reviewers were complaining about portion sizes - this was not an issue for my husband or myself! Our portions felt huge and they were so filling! My husband is 6'4"" and is not a slender man, so if he left full, everyone else should too! There also seemed to be concerns about the vegan\/vegetarian menu options... if you want a steak, go to a steakhouse. These are unique and flavorful dishes that go beyond what the average palette is accommodated to. Don't let the lack of meat dissuade you; live a little and enjoy the food as it is all handmade and fresh, not the frozen overproduced meat products that you can expect even at the finest of steakhouses (and trust me, I love a good steak just as much as the next guy, but this was next level!).

Recommended for special occasions as this experience is a bit on the pricey side, but worth every dollar! Also, their menu changes seasonally so there's opportunity to go back time and time again. We can't wait to go back and bring more people with us! Oh, and the 20% local discount is great!!!"	5	BLACKOUT Dining in the Dark	4
I go for the Lunch Specials most times. Mostly the servings are plenty and the food tasted very good. The family size dinners are even better if your really hungry. Service is very good overall and the staff is friendly. You can't go wrong trying this place.	4	Pearl Wok To Go	3.5
We've been coming here for a dozen years. Amazing $3 draft beer. The karaoke is hit or miss, but the best I've ever heard. They can be a little weird about the rules, but whatever. Everybody is friendly, in the bar and casino. The $7.99 steak dinner is THE BEST on the strip. Decent steak, killer price. Get out of the huge casinos that are sucking you dry and experience some old school Vegas.	5	Ellis Island Hotel, Casino & Brewery	4

They have a poor advertising promoting steak and crab legs $12.99. Be prepared to fight for it though. Ate at the Las Vegas Blvd and Warm Springs location but no employee has ever heard of it OR managers they say it's only for participating... I said its false advertising and it was honored. Sadly worst crab legs we ever had. DRY DRY DRY. Eat there all the time! Very disappointed.	1	Outback Steakhouse	3.5
OUTSTANDING FOOD AND SERVICE!! Great friendly neighborhood restaurant! Everything is yummy!! The ambiance is geat with jammies and hanging umbrellas. Potatoes are amazing with a hint of rosemary. The french toast- and I would recommend the addicting crunchy selection is always served with whipped butter and a bottle of warm syrup! The pot of bread with a touch of cinnamon is is offered with a spot of jam and whipped butter. A wonderful selection on their menu. They always wish to have your feedback for any improvement and the owner comes around to talk and ensure it is a pleasurable experience. Very personable. This is my first review and I eat out for almost every meal. Worth the time.. Hope you enjoy!!	5	Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place	4

"Nannys catered moms 75th Birthday and we could not have been more satisfied!! They shows up early. The food looked fabulous. The prices were truly reasonable for we did our homework.
But forget the prices for we only allowed the flavor of the food to allow our decision making. 
We had already committed elsewhere. It was impossible not to switch. The food was top notch. They delivered out to southern highlands. The prices were less then half from the original choice. I would completely and only choose Nanny's for catering and a quick sandwich, meal or pastry. Croissants melt in your mouth. Italian sandwich.. The food hits your palate and in an instant becomes memorable. Trust me it's memorable!! Try it! It's simply amazing. 
Thank you Nannys's. Looking forward to my new go to cafe. Did I say amazing??"	5	Nanny's	4.5
Waiter great. Food great. I'd just stay away from the pie. We saw many plates and desserts pass us and the pie did NOT match up. The only thing that is say is portions are lovely except for the measly portions of pie. Waiter would have provided another piece whether we actually wanted it or not.. We only commented for it was so noticeable but the manager came by hearing only a part of our conversation if you could imagine halting any satisfactory resolution had we even been interested. Yes the manager! Crazy	4	Sundance Grill	3

Had a great meal with the family and was delighted with our server Nicky. He was pleasant and courteous. He made wonderful suggestions which led to a wonderful meal everyone was satisfied with. With service like this we will be back!! What a nice young man!!! Yummy food	5	Dickey's Barbecue Pit	3
Sugarcane is located in walkway between Palazzo and Venetian casino's.  Half of the place is a bar\/lounge, other half is restaurant.  We knew the GM, from his many years at SushiSamba, so wanted to try his new place.  Quite obvious he is extremely knowledgeable and enjoys what he does, as he took time to explain each dish's ingredients, preparation and commentary.  Started with seasoned Brussel sprouts, goat cheese croquettes, bacon-wrapped dates and liqueur samples.  All tasted amazing.  Then had raw halibut on ice, with sliced grapes, olives and seaweed, salmon poke.  Next had lobster slices with caviar and greens.  Waffles, roasted duck, duck egg with maple syrup came next, as the GM separated duck meat, breaking egg yolk and adding syrup.  We agreed this was the best dish.  Next sweet corn kernels with chipotle mayo, lemon salt, and skirt steak with watercress.  Dessert was french toast, caramelized apples with cinnamon ice cream.  A truly wonderful meal, not too heavy, but lots of different flavors to savor.  Aside from the delicious food, the GM and staff clearly added to our enjoyable dining experience.	5	SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill - Las Vegas	4.5
This is a good spot in town square to lighten your wallet and eat some okay American food. You will pretty not walk out of here spending less than $15 a person. Once you get there you HAVE got to have the zucchini spears (7 piece?) because those are good, and make you fat.	4	Claim Jumper	3
We stayed at the silver sevens hotel because we got an offer in the mail for 2 comp. nights and 2 free buffets, I was hesitant about it because I had never stayed there before and it's not exactly a 5 star hotel, but we made our reservations anyways. We got there a bit early and when we checked in the lady that helped us was very nice and professional. We got to our room on the 1st floor and the room was clean, spacious, quiet and everything was working just fine, we got a premium room, they are freshly renovated. I would stay again at this hotel. Buffet was good but very limited, but it was free, can't complain. Yes I would come back.	4	Silver Sevens Hotel and Casino	2.5
This is a great place to have breakfast, lunch or dinner, prices are very reasonable, this time we came for breakfast, i got the pancake special, 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and 3 pieces of either bacon or sausage, $5.99 my husband got the steak and eggs $6.99, what a great deal! Service was awsome, lucy was our waitress, she was great! Very attentive and always with a smile despite of how busy it was. Yes i do recomend this place food is tasty along with good service!	5	Village Pub and Cafe	3.5
We come here for the steak special, it's not on the menu but you can order it for 7.99,  food and service is good. Yes make sure you get your players card!	4	Mr. Lucky's 24-7	3.5
Everytime we go to las vegas we make sure we go to ellis island, its cheap and delicious! Once we wen for breakfast before 11 am and we got steak and eggs for only 4.99, the steak was delicious and a good size, we have been there for bar-b-q and their chicken and ribs are also great and not to expensive. Make sure you get their rewards card and you will get good dinner deals too! I highly recommend it!	5	Ellis Island Hotel, Casino & Brewery	4
We stayed at the silver sevens hotel and casino, and with our stay they gave us a buy one get one free buffet , it was very inexpensive, the buffet is limited but it was good enough for us, they had salads, at the carving station they had pork which was very tender, mash potatoes, gravy, Mexican, chicken and Chinese food, we had great service, and we walked out full and happy, yes we will be back here again!	4	S7 Buffet	2.5
I'm always searching for new places to eat when we go to vegas, this time I found Tiffany's and told my husband about it, we went in and the place was not busy, a guy named Omar greeted us and ask us what we wanted to drink, then he took our order, and then I realized that he was the waiter and the cook! He cooked our meals really fast, our meals were very good, my husband got a breakfast and I got a dinner. We returned the next day before going home and the place was busy and Omar greeted us with a big smile, took our order and I was amazed on how fast he was! There was another waitress taking orders and another guy helping, we will be back to Tiffany's food and service are great! See you soon Omar!	5	Tiffany's Cafe	4
Pleasantly surprised by the deliciousness. I'm definitely picky about Chinese food (as I'm Chinese), and a lot of the food in Vegas is okay. I started with the Hakka drink (get it, you won't regret it). I wish this came in a 32 oz by the pool- I could drink it all day. Had the steamed dim sum appetizer which was good. But my dinner of lobster with snow peas & garlic. Very good flavor, not too salty, and the bak chou was crunchy and garlicky. Loved it! If I had been here for another day, I'd consider eating here again!	5	Hakkasan Restaurant	4
"I don't eat seafood, so a sushi restaurant isn't usually my type of place.  I was with a group on this trip, so my food choices were over ruled by 5 others.  I entered into Blue Ribbon scared and concerned.  Scared because I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into and concerned that I would leave hungry.  I am happy to report however that not only were my worries unfounded but I actually really liked this restaurant too.

Like I said, I don't eat fish... I mean none.  As a group we ordered appetizers, I only was able to try one non-seafood item, the meatballs, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good they were.  As my table ordered many sushi plates to share, I ordered my entrée.  I chose the filet with mashed sweet potatoes, this was one of the best filets I have ever had.  The meat was cooked to a perfect medium per my request, seasoned well, and the sauce that was served on the steak was very tasty as too.  The sweet potatoes were creamy and delicious.

The server at our table was very attentive.  We never had to wait for our waters be refilled or for new drink orders to be taken.  He also provided great insight into the menu and helped the table decide what we might like.  He really knew the menu well and was very helpful.

 I highly recommend Blue Ribbon for both the food and service.  Who knew a non-seafood eater would love a sushi restaurant so much.  I'm looking forward to going back again anytime."	4	Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill	3.5
"I was very much looking forward to my first visit to Scarpetta, I had heard great things about it and couldn't wait. 

I was surprised that the menu was so limited.  The appetizers were very limited and if you don't like seafood, tartare, or mushrooms it will be a challenge to find anything you can eat.  I wasn't able to find anything which was a bummer.  I was also surprised that there wasn't an offering of dinner salads or anything like that before the meal.  

The highlight before the entrees arrived was actually the bread, there is a warm bread that has some cheese and a salami or beef in it.  It tastes like fresh pizza bread and it is amazing.  I might visit again for this bread alone.

For the entrée, I had the veal cooked medium.  It was good but the mustard sauce was a bit tangy and was not my favorite.  I tried to limit the amount that was on my veal as much as possible.  Otherwise, the veal was cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  It was not fatty and there was plenty of meat on the bone.

For dessert I enjoyed the Nutella & Vanilla Creme Bombolini.  I had no idea what to expect but it was like mini doughnut holes filled with either the crème or the nutella in the center.  The ice cream that came with it was banana and was quite good as well.  It was a great dessert to share and I would recommend this to anyone looking for an indulgent dessert.

Service here was great.  We were checked on frequently and the food was delivered promptly after ordering."	4	Scarpetta	4
"Wow. Well if you are a degenerate from the area, you have been here. They have amazing food. They have great prices. They have great people. Usually you'll find yourself paying for your professor's drinks at this place - especially if you are a finance major. 
They do not have Corona, they do have Peroni and when the bartender tells you that they are similar, they are not. 
This place usually has some sort of sunday dinner thing going on, and that food is fantastic."	5	Stake Out Bar & Grill	4
"After many many drinks the other night, I had a pizza craving that I just couldn't shake.  I was trying to think where I could grab a slice fast coming home from Cosmo to Bellagio.  Of course I know that there is a pizza place in Cosmo, but I've been there so I was on a quest to try somewhere new.  That's when I remembered that there is a pizza place across the street and right next to the Walgreens.  That is where I found Bonanno's NY.

Right around midnight, I walked into Bonanno's NY.  There were various slice options available, but no 'just sausage' pizza.  I was bummed  and annoyed because that is the only thing I really like.  Instead I got a sausage and pepperoni slice and asked the woman behind the counter for the slice with the least pepperoni since I was going to pick it all off.  A couple min. later, my slice was heated and ready to eat.  I took the pepperoni off and took a big bite.  I quickly decided I would need to dab the excess grease off the top, it was sooo greasy!  The rest of the slice was finished in a blur, it was ok but far from the best.

I headed back to the hotel and brushed my teeth before going to bed.  As I woke up about 7hrs later, all I could taste was garlic.  Yuck!  I brushed my teeth two more times and still everything in my world was garlic flavored until after noon.  Thank you pizza for reminding me that you shouldn't order junk to eat after a few too many cocktails.

I don't think I will be visiting here again soon.  Glad I tried it, but I think I will stick with the pizza at Cosmo next time I'm craving a late night slice."	2	Bonnano's	3.5
"Ok, so obviously Jean Philippe has great pastries but I have to tell you about the Vanilla Scone I had on my latest visit.  

So... it was about 9:30pm and I was going to head back to my room but I decided to venture over to Jean Philippe for a late dessert.  I hop in-line with no clue what I really want.  Should I get the caramel filled muffin that looks so delicious, the chocolate croissant that I know I love, or should I try something new?  I opt for trying something new and though I don't tend to like scones, I gave the vanilla glazed scone a try... I figured if it was bad then I would save some calories.

Upon the first bite of my scone, I knew this is what heaven would take like if it was a food.  The scone was dense but not too dense and it was moist and not dry or crumbly like many of the more commercially purchased scones can get.  The vanilla flavor was powerful but in a very welcome and appreciated way.  I think I could have eaten 5 in one sitting, lucky for my waistline, I didn't have that many. 

I can't wait to get back to enjoy another one of these delicious treats, it is a MUST try item!"	5	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
"After many trips to the Bellagio, I recently ate at the Café for the time.  The menu is much more approachable and the prices are more affordable than other offerings on side; I still thought everything was a bit expensive for what it was though.

I tried the BBQ Chicken salad during this visit.  It was a deconstructed salad, the romaine was left as a head and was just split down the middle.  You the customer needs to cut the romaine up into manageable bits and then cut off the inedible base.  The salad had a bbq ranch dressing, but I didn't get much on my plate.  I think having the dressing on the side would have been a better option.  The lettuce was accompanied by a pile of black beans and fried onion strings and a chicken breast that was cut into strips.   For $21 I was unimpressed, I think that the similar BBQ chicken salad at Panera taste better and is half the price.

The service, like most location in the Bellagio was impeccable.  The server was very nice and our drinks were filled and food was delivered quickly.

If you don't' want to leave the hotel and want a relaxed atmosphere, The Café is your best option.  If you are looking for a more affordable option, there are several on the Strip, go out and see what you can find."	3	Cafe Bellagio	3.5
"Yet again, my evil coworkers plan dinner at a seafood place.  There is a bit of background here... during my Jan trip to LV, they planned a dinner at a sushi place in Cosmo knowing that I don't eat fish at all!  I eat various types of meat, chicken, beef, pork but no fish.  

I got a text asking if I wanted to join everyone for dinner, of course I said ""yes"" before asking where they were taking me only to find out that it was Yellow Tail.  I'm sure for some, this would be a great treat since I'm told that Yellow Tail at the Bellagio has great seafood, for me it was a diet night.  

I got to the restaurant bar around 6:30 and had a quick drink with everyone.  The bartender was very nice and they do have vanilla vodka, so I was happy with my drink.  We were seated shortly after and were quickly greeted by our server, he was very nice and attentive throughout the entire meal, he was great!

So my very funny coworkers decided to order a Chef sampling, so I ate nothing due to the fact it was all seafood.  The server noticed my lack of food, he felt terrible and offered to bring me some cooked meat... we decided upon a filet cooked medium.  My filet arrived shortly after the order and I promptly wolfed it down in about 3min flat.  I have never been so happy to see cooked beef in my life.  The filet was ok, cooked well and topped with some sizzling teriyaki sauce.  It wasn't as good as Prime, but given that this is a seafood place, I was just glad that they had the option.

I did try some cold Saki for the first time ever.  I was scared at first but it turned out to be very good and was nice to sip along with the meal. 

I would return here for the service and beverages without question.  Knowing that they do have cooked beef on the menu is a HUGE plus, I know I won't starve at least. haha"	4	Yellowtail	3.5
"My first night at the Cosmo I went looking for a good dinner place... I wanted one that was comfortable and not too stuffy, what can I say I wanted to stay in my jeans and flip-flops all night.  I walked past Holsteins thinking that it would be like a TGI Friday's or something.  The appearance of the place was relaxed and that's just the type of food and menu I expected.  Boy was I wrong, this place is gourmet burger mecca with a very beer and wine menu to choose from.

Our group was seated quickly and we decided to order drinks.  Good new Cider beer fans, you have 3 options to chose from hear and I can now confirm that they are all delicious.  The raspberry cider was the best I think!  They have an extensive beer and wine list as well, so whatever your heart desires is available.

Appetizers were both good, we had Redneck Poppers and the wings.  Poppers were very unique and good, I would order those again for sure.  The wings were very spicy so if you like the feeling of your lips burning, then this is the place for you.

For dinner I had the Longhorn Burger, that's bbq pulled pork on a beef patty.  It was very messy to devour but was good eats for sure!  I didn't get any cole slaw on my burger because I don't like it but usually this burger comes with it.  I also ordered steak fries, they were plain old steak fries but are always a favorite of mine.

I didn't have a shake or dessert on this visit but I did see several pass by our table and they all looked amazing!

Next time you're in the Cosmo and looking for a high-end burger in a casual atmosphere, this is the place for you."	4	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4
"My goal this past week has been to visit places that I've never been in LV before.  I stayed at Aria a few years ago, but hadn't been back since so I decided to walk over and see what is new or had changed in that time.  It was around dinner and I was wander around the reception area and I spotted a restaurant that looked relaxed and casual in the far right corner.  This happened to be Todd English Pub, and is the place I decided to have dinner Sunday night.

I entered Todd English Pub around 8pm and the place was packed.  You needed reservations for a table, but since it was just me, I sat at the bar.  I was quickly greeted and given a menu by my server.  I checked out the drink menu and was thrilled to see that they had Strongbow Cider on the menu, so I quickly ordered one.  Price for the cider was $11 per glass, but I love cider so it worth it.  

I perused the menu for a while, not sure if I should order a Pub meal like Sheppard's Pie or a burger.  I finally made up my mind and went with Chicken Tacos ($16), the description made them sound flavorful and delicious and didn't let me down.  The chicken tacos come 3 to an order with a crock or rice and beans.  The shells were good; soft shells and held up well against the moist chicken meat and salsa.  The chicken was so moist and well seasoned, I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it and could have eaten even more.  The rice and beans were presented mixed in a crock and were good with a bit of spice as well.   After two glasses of cider and the tacos, my bill totaled $41.  A bit steep, but it's LV so not too bad comparatively.

The service at the bar was great.  I wish I would have gotten my servers name, but he was attentive and quick to make sure I had what I needed.  

I will definitely be coming here again in the near future.  I can't wait to try other menu items!"	4	Todd English P.U.B.	3.5
"After a few nights of eating 'fancy' food, I wanted to have a relaxed dinner with more down to earth food.  When a coworker of mine mentioned that they had been to BurGR earlier in the week, it made my stomach grumble as they described the burgers and fries that they had.  My last night in LV, I finally had a free night and decided to visit BurGR for myself.

First a note for all those who want to eat here; there are no reservations unless you have a very large group, so plan to check-in and wait for a while before you get seated.  I went with a group of six and luckily one of the girls headed over to check us in early... I think her wait was about 25min.  We were seated right after 6:30pm.

We were seated and then our waitress came over to our table with a tablet that had all the drinks available on it.  The tablet is only used as a drink menu, you can't order your drinks on it or anything, you still have to give her your drink order.  The tablet seems like a waste, just give me a drink menu on paper if the waitress still has to come back and take the order.  On a better note, they have Angry Orchard Cider and  Pear Cider here, so I was thrilled!

The BurGr menu is limited and specialized to Burgers and Hot Dogs plus traditional sides that would go with this type of food.  This is fine by me, I like the idea of a restaurant doing one thing and doing it well!  

The appetizers didn't appeal to me, I'm not a fan of Jalapeño Poppers or Onion Ring.  All the app options were either fried foods or sliders with some kind of condiment that I wouldn't like... I passed on these.  

The burger I order was the Southern Yardbird Burger ($14), which was ground chicken patty topped with mustard bbq sauce and cheese (it has onion strings on it but I ordered mine w\/out).  The patty itself was very moist and well seasoned, I loved it!  The mustard BBQ sauce though wasn't my favorite, it just tasted like yellow mustard, nothing bbq like about it.  I scraped off some, added ketchup, and mixed it up so that it tasted more like a bbq sauce.  

For sides, we tried one of each fry.  There are Just Fries ($8), Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11), and Sweet Potato fries ($9).  The original fries were good, but pretty standard thick cut fries.  The truffle fries were just the thick cut fries with some truffle oil and parmesan shredded.  Both of the fries were good but not noteworthy.  The Sweet Potato fries though were AMAZING!  I don't like sweet potatoes and never eat them and as recent as the 4th of July, I tried sweet potato fries near home and wasn't a fan of them at all.  I don't know what they do to make the sweet potato fries so mouth wateringly good, but I love them!  They are a must order item if you visit here.

We didn't have dessert, but they did have a toffee pudding that sounded delicious.  

I would highly recommend coming here for the Sweet Potato fries alone.  The burgers are good and I would like to try a beef burger on my next visit."	4	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
"After dinner I decided to walk along the Strip for a while to see some sight and relax.  On my way back to Bellagio from Caesar's, I noticed Palio Pronto out of the corner of my eye.  I didn't have dessert with dinner, so I decided to indulge in some treats before heading back to my room.  

I ordered a chocolate dipped waffle cone with Choc. Chip gelato and a Oatmeal Raisin Crumble Cookie.  The cone was good, I don't think it was fresh but it's hard to go wrong with a chocolate dipped cone.  The gelato was creamy and smooth, I wish there would have been more choc. Chip pieces in the mix though, it would have been even better.  The Oatmeal Raisin Crumble Cookie wasn't the best... it was a bit dry for my taste and the raisins slid right off the top of the cookie, bummer!  

Those two items with a water were $16.  I know it's LV, but that is steep!
Not sure that I would recommend a visit to this snack location.  I don't think I will make the stop again."	2	Palio Pronto	3.5
"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! The WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED! Server had some major attitude who slammed things and never bothered to check on us after messing up our order.

Basically they screwed up an order and refused to fix it. On top of that we got major attitude regardless of how nice we were to her initially. In addition, they took their time closing out our table while we waited so long just to pay. Talk about taking things too personally. It affected the next guests having to wait for a table. Never coming back here again. Especially because that one server with the rude attitude. 

Don't waste your time here."	1	Fukumimi Ramen	4
Food is okay... So the one star goes to that, but the service is terrible!!! The First Lady was just slow, but she was the only one working at that time, so I don't blame her, then the food takes over 30 mins to come... Fine! But the lady who bring the food over is just rude!!!! Putting 2 salad dish on table, one with feta, one without, didn't bother to ask who wants the one without the feta cheese, then once we ask her which is which, she just say that's the one without the feta! Move it over! I was like... Wth.. Is this how you talk to the customer!?! U remind me of those cafeteria lady back in high school... I must give you a bad review for that!!!	1	Burke in the Box	2

"We have been meaning to come into this spot on our last few trips to LV; so glad we finally did it. We sat at the bar and our good fortune brought us Sergio-- the most down to earth, friendly, and talented bartender. He recommended some game changing dishes -- the shrimp mojo with a side of house made tortillas, the fish tacos, and some siu mai. Finished with the most perfect coconut rice and mango dessert. The drinks he made us are the best we've had in Vegas in years! I had a margarita served with hibiscus ice - beautifully presented. (We also tasted some delicious aguas frescas made daily in house.)

The food alone was amazing, but because of the relaxed and personal vibe Sergio created, we will be back time and time again. Truly, an authentic experience unlike anything we've encountered on the strip."	5	China Poblano	3.5

"As far as Vegas buffets go, the Golden Nugget isn't going to blow your socks off. It's not bad, it's just not great. My most recent visit was Memorial Day weekend so prices for buffets were incredibly inflated ($50+ per person) so when we walked by and saw the GN was only $21.99 we went for it. We wanted to get one vegas buffet visit in during our trip. 

The best options were the pastas- mac and cheese, ravioli, bow tie pasta. Lots of creamy sauces!Some of the Asian offerings were pretty good too especially the General Tao's chicken. Spicy, sweet and cooked nicely so it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. 

I have a massive sweet tooth so the dessert section was heaven! I highly recommend the pineapple upside down cake and the Black Forest cake. Did not like the coconut cream pie or the apple cobbler. 

If you're looking for an affordable buffet with some decent food, this is your place. If you're looking for a foodie experience, go somewhere else."	3	Golden Nugget Buffet	2.5
"Full disclosure: I've seen every DDD episode ever made and I love Guy so I feel like I was destined to love his restaurant. I was not disappointed!

After seeing a few other Yelpers post videos of the Trash Can Brisket Nachos I knew I had to get them. It is an unbelievable amount of food and a genius way to serve nachos! There were tons of layers of cheese, meat, BBQ sauce, pico de gallo and jalapeños so no chip was naked. So perfect! I only took a before picture but I was embarrassed at how much I left- it's a huge serving and should absolutely be shared! It was a great value for $19 in Vegas!

My husband ordered the ribs which were cooked to perfection and smothered in a perfectly sweet and spicy sauce. The ribs came with mac and cheese which was mediocre and a cornbread muffin covered in cheese and jalapeños that was delish!

This is a great affordable option in Vegas especially for all of the Guy lovers out there! Fun atmosphere and really good food!"	4	Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar	3.5
"No doubt about it, the best Indian food in Vegas. I've been coming here for years, from 1 to 5 times a week in my prime. My fav dishes are Lamb Jalfrezi, Lamb Tikka Massala and Lamb Rogan Josh, but over the years I've tried almost the entire menu. You can't go wrong. 

Wash this glorious food down with an ice cold Taj Mahal and you're golden.

Conveniently located just a few mins from the strip.

A 'must do' when you visit Vegas.

Best Restaurant in Las Vegas. They are like a trip to Germany without the airfare. Beautifully done interior with a German decor. They are a lively restaurant with everyone talking, Laughing, and having a good time.  Beer from heaven as they offer everything you could want. They also have a full bar and if you go at lunch time you will see the most adorable bartender as you enter the front door. You will want to stop and chat but go ahead and enter the restaurant and experience the fun filled time that is to be had. Live Music every night will make you stomp your feet and clap. The best part is the food. I have been here for more meals than I should tell you. I have tried almost everything and I have never found anything bad. This restaurant is my go to place to eat 2 to 4 times a week. Also when I have guest from out of town. I can always count on Hofbrauhaus.	5	Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas	3.5

"This was a great side trip during the last bachelor's party. It's a short ride from the Strip and located in the corner of a strip mall. No better place than this, I wish I was there right now. We went here after the advice of Guy Fieri's Triple D... I'm a huge fan of his books.

Five hungry guys devoured their food quickly. Oxtail? YES. Smothered on fries? HELL YES.  With an egg on top? WHY IS IT NOT IN FRONT ME OF YET?

The different choices of burgers made it a great place for our different tastes. I had the Kim Chi burger and oh my.. it was delicious. Banh Mi burger? Oh yeah.. I'll have one of those too. If I had a larger stomach and a bigger wallet, I would've ordered a few more burgers. Definitely worth the side trip.

Tip: If you're expecting to go there by cab, make sure you have a cab driver's number. After our meal, we couldn't find a cab to go back to the strip even after calling 10 different taxi companies, luckily for us, we found a taxi waiting at the local dentist."	5	Bachi Burger	4
"Yes I know, the dance floor is way over crowded. But you won't complain when you hook up with someone on the dance floor...and it's a very high chance to hook up when you're literally grinding with the person next to you when you move. You all know it's true.

Drinks are regular club priced. Not horrible.
There are half naked girls swimming in flower covered bath tubs.
Good Dj and sound system.

For people looking to get a deal, or to bypass the long lines, this is what you do...Eat dinner here! You need to eat anyways right? So have dinner here at 9pm, which requires that you buy an entrée dish for at least $30, and then tell your waitress that you would like a stamp for the club afterwards. Chill, have some drinks, then roll up to the club! Just beware of special holidays, because even with the stamp, you will need to pay $20 (half off) for the club, which isn't bad. Was just here for memorial day weekend ($30 food, $20 club). Yeah yeah, your breath will stank. Bring some gum foo. Gosh."	4	Tao Nightclub	3
Came to Vegas for a work conference and had some down time at night. I asked some of the gentlemen I was with for a good vodka bar and was sent here. The atmosphere is dark but inviting. We took a seat at a table when you first walk in and were almost instantly greeted by our waitress. She was polite and explained how to order, as they use ipads for their menus. My group ordered vodka on the rocks, a chocolate shot, Apple Cider, and something else that I can't remember. Anyhoo, it was all fabulous! The bar tenders hand chipped an ice round that fit into the glass they used for the vodka rocks, it was very impressive how perfectly it fit. The chocolate shot was divine and tasted like chocolate milk. I am still dreaming about the Apple Cider, which was a martini, it was so good. I will certainly make a repeat trip next time I am in Vegas!	4	Red Square Restaurant & Vodka Lounge	4
Came here on a business trip and loved it. The ambiance was cozy and pretty. The food was really good. The service left a little to be desired but they were pretty busy when I was there. The margaritas were spectacular and something that they boast since they have an extensive selection of tequila.	4	Javier's	4
"Back again for work and had some free time. Decided to have a pint at Todd English P.U.B. Sat at the bar and learned something new; they have a 7 second challenge. If you drink a pint in 7 seconds without spilling too much you get it for free. They have sand timers welded on the bar just for that purpose. 

The bar tender was very accommodating and helped me chose a yummy red ale. Friendly with everyone but not intrusive. 

This is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to relax with a beer while in Vegas."	4	Todd English P.U.B.	3.5

Great customer service. Delicious food. Clean and colorful venue. I came in after seeing pictures on yelp and it was definitely accurate. The food server was very nice and had a great attitude. I sat at the bar area, was served chips and salsa and then a cup of fideo soup, all delicious! I'm a hard critique when it comes to Mexican food as I come from a Mexican family who cooks authentic food. Plus I don't live here in Vegas, I live in California. This place is definitely a nice restaurant all around. I will come back. Highly recommend.	5	Las Enchiladas Demama	4.5
"The only true ITALIAN food in Henderson!  The best true Italian food I have tasted in years.

My family normally dines at the CA locations and Sammy's never disappoints! We usually have salads, pizza, and pasta. My wife is a big fan of the vegan options!

"If you're in Vegas and you're looking for the ramen place, come here. 

For parties larger than 6, you might have to wait a while. However they're very accommodating to seating you separately if necessary.

Definitely try out the Deluxe Ramen - Miso style. The broth is very rich and flavorful. The pork cuts are extremely tender and not rubbery at all. The bamboo shoots are authentic as it gets. Definitely a 5\/5 tasting ramen.

Getting the Shoyu or Shio can be a bit salty so watch out. 

I think the corn butter ramen with miso broth lacks flavor. The small Curry side is average, nothing spectacular. 

Parking is on the back. 

If you're super hungry, make sure to order an extra large bowl."	4	Ramen Sora	4
"If you want to enjoy non-traditional Vegas, try this. High Tea is so worth it here.

It's as if you're a high class British colonial gentleman or lady and enjoying your mid-afternoon delights.

2x scones (blueberry, cranberry), 3x pastries (fruit tart, dark chocolate, etc.), 4x quarter sandwiches (salmon, chicken, turkey, king crab, etc.)

Tea comes with sugar and milk."	5	Petrossian Bar	4
"The Autumn Greens salad tasted average (drowned in Apple Vinaigrette sauce).

The pizza quality tasted average compared to Pieology. Choose the Genovese over the Gianna. 

Pizza are 11 inches and are cut in four. If you can't eat much, I would recommend sharing a pizza with someone. You'll probably get full from 2 slices."	3	Flour & Barley	3.5
I've eaten at Hash House A Go Go on the strip & it was awesome but the one  downtown has the WORST service ever. Not busy but we waited 10 min for a hostess. Another wait to clean a table. Greeted by a lackadaisical waitress who was smacking gum. Took our drink order, brought us cold coffee & hot orange juice. A full 10 min later she takes our order.  We wait & wait, no warm up on my coffee offered. The MANAGER brings my husband's order & leaves. 10 minutes later my food has not arrived and my husband's is cold because he refuses to start eating without me, plus his order is wrong. Another 5 minutes, gum smacker shows up, says she will bring more coffee. Where's my food? She will check. More waiting, finally back with her gum a snacking and her attitude  ugly, says my food will be right out! I don't know when my order came because we left as did the couple across from us that was also waiting, watching & waiting some more.  We went across the street to Duprey's where we were greeted, seated, served and stuffed in 20 minutes. Great pancakes. Our waitress was a doll. Do not go go to Hash House A Go Go. Skip it & go to Duprey's.	1	Hash House A Go Go	3.5
Chicago Joes Blows!!  The exterior of the building looks inviting like an old home, but the inside is a different story.  It is uncomfortably dark, dingy, and extremely cramped.  We ordered chicken and eggplant parmigiana for entrees and had a salad to start.  The salad was good, nothing special there.  The entrees were horrible.  The chicken parmigiana was a meager piece of overcooked chicken with the frying batter smeared on top topped with what seemed like a pound of half melted cheese.  The eggplant tasted as though it spoiled a week ago, yet they served it to us.  The marinara sauce for both entrees tasted like it was the scrapings from the bottom of the burnt pan from the previous day.  Trying to salvage a bleak meal we ordered a cannoli in hopes it would redeem the experience.  Sadly this was not the case.  All in all this was a big disappointment and a waste of money.	2	Chicago Joe's	4
"So, what is this!?  What is this awesomeness they call ""Guiness and Beef Stew""!?  I mean, really?  

And WHY haven't I tried it before.  God, it was excellent.  

Anyway, we were in Vegas this past weekend and had an actual rare night to ourselves (me and the lady) so we went to look for food.  Our TAO reservations were for the day after and so we yelped what was good near the area.  Of course, Rí Rá popped up, and we liked the name, so we chanced it.

I was actually quite worried we wouldn't find the place, but it's actually easy to spot.  Just head down to the area between Mandalay Bay and Luxor.  Then, look for the huge Guinness store.  It's part of\/next to\/permanently attached to the hip to Rí Rá.  

So, anyway, I ordered the stew and she ordered the Fish and Chips.  She ordered some crazy drink, and I ordered some kind of Oktoberfest.  But, I wish now I grabbed a (insert blarney accent here) ""point"".  It'd go so good with the Stew.  Anyway, I'll give this place the four stars because of that stew.  She loved it.  I loved it.  

It had this slight hint of the popular Irish pint.  But, I think it actually added more to the flavor because of its bitterness.  The beef was really soft, and though I'd rather have potato chunks, the mash was soft and delicious.

Service, for us anyway, was great.  They were attentive, though sometimes we'd go for fairly long stretches between checks.  Though, we were quite in the middle of conversation for most of the night, so I actually thought it was nice of them to leave mostly well enough alone.

Come here for the stew!  Good lord.  Now I gotta find a place in LA that serves that stuff even better!"	4	Rí Rá Irish Pub	4
"In an effort to keep up the ""Yelp-tiquette"", I'll say this is for the restaurant.  Never stepped foot in the night club.  

Loved this place when I first ate here, years ago.  And, while I was in Vegas, I decided to bring the girlfriend here to check it out again.  So, we made reservations about two weeks prior.  And on a Sunday.  So, anyway, I think the reservations thing was what made me give this place four stars instead of five.

Even with reservations, we had to wait almost half an hour for a table.  Which I can understand to a point.  Now, the place was packed, but there was still a few tables for two open when we were walking by.  Not to mention, we were five minutes early.  Oh well.  Not too mad about it though.

Okay, first thing I got to say, the Kobe sashimi was awesome.  Had to try it, even though it was quite a pricey item.  Interesting, though some traditional wasabi and some of the fresh wasabi together would be divine.

For my dinner, I had the Grilled Raw Tuna.  The Asian Green Stir Fry was good, though I suppose the saltiness of it balances out the tuna.  And the peppercorn sauce just made it all mesh together nicely.  It was sweet, which accented the Tuna in a subtle way that really pulled the flavors out. 

Then the Lady had the Diver Scallops in curry sauce.  And man, those scallops were gigantic!  Buttery in the center but nicely seared outside.  

Anyway, always had a fairly good time here as a restaurant.  Now, next time, maybe I'll actually get to try the nightclub.  Heh."	4	Tao Nightclub	3
"When people say that you get generous portions, they are not lying.  You get serving trays for your personal orders.  So, we definitely had too much food, since there were six of us eating there.  

I ended up ordering the HH Original Benedict.  And it was pretty darn good...though the sauce covered up most things in its taste.  I could barely taste the bacon, and forget even tasting the green fix-ins.  However, I could overshadow that with the fact that it was yummy sauce.  

Our server was awesome, and a real friendly guy.  He didn't even bat an eyelash when we all used twitter to get a free drink (Mango Iced Tea, that day).  He also encouraged a friend in his Man v. Food challenge.

For the most part, it was darn good.  Even though it did feel like you ingested an entire loaf of meat and potatoes afterward. 

I didn't see any of the long lines, but we went on a Tuesday at 11am.  I just wish I had enough room to try out their bread pudding!"	3	Hash House A Go Go	4
"The single by pass burger was delicious and the right size. Along with the 1\/2 pound hot dog. It was so heavy that you can't eat it with your hands, you have to cut the hot dog up into portions to eat it.

This Place will rob you!!!!! I went with a group of 7 girls on Aug. 17, 2012. My friend got the 1st. round of drinks and I got the second. I gave Marshall (the bartender) a $20 bill and he gave me change of a $10 bill !!!!!!. I complained to the manager which was no help. (he said they would have to count the money at closing and they would call if there's extra) which he never did. So be careful !!!! in this shady place.	1	Diablo's Cantina	3
"DH and I were on the annual trek to Vegas and were tempted to try the Flame based on a coupon from restaurant dot com.

Walking in, I felt like I was going back to the days of Vegas and mobsters.  Salmon leather booths, plain tables.  No families, no kids. Quiet.  Mostly older couples - I think  we were the youngest in the room (and, believe me, we aren't that young).  But we thought - hey, its okay, how bad can it be.

Talk about never judge a book by its cover!  We started with salads that were just too huge for one person - the caprese salad would have served 3 easily with the most wonderful heirloom tomatoes.  I could have stopped there and been happy, but we kept going - and I was glad we did!  Let me warn you - the sides are huge, they are splittable so don't order too many!  Baked potato was just a good old-fashioned baked potato that was so creamy, it was a meal in itself.  We had asparagus w\/ Hollandaise and the mushrooms sauteed in Cabernet butter - heavenly.  My DH had a steak which was quite good - nice size, cooked perfectly.  I challenged the kitchen to serve me medium rare lamb chops - and the chef rose to the challenge!  Grilled perfectly, they were tender and flavorful - I wanted to gnaw the bones, they were so tasty!  Even the bread was good - a nice, old fashioned variety of breads, warmed to perfection.

Our waiter was that rare breed that understands that it is important to pay attention, but not be bothersome. His recommendations were right on (the Pinot Noir was a great choice).   In this day and age of waitstaff that is either ""perky"" or ""non-existent"", I felt his service was deserving of an email ""shout out"" to the restaurant management.

All in all, the  Flame was a great experience.  It is definitely one of the old Vegas restaurants - no flash, no glitter - but worth a repeat trip next trip out!"	5	The Flame Steakhouse	3.5
"We visit Vegas at least once a year and decided to see how their ribs stack up to what we get back home.

This place was okay but not  really great.

The ribs were very overdone and bland. They needed a good rub to make them tastier, not just slather them in sauce.  The brisket was - how can I say it - just kind of weird.  We are used to slow smoked brisket and this looked and tasted like a rump roast that was cooked like a rump roast and sliced thin and had sauce dumped on it.  DH liked the potato salad. I swear the sweet potato fries (which are a staple in our house) were the frozen ones we buy at the grocers so, yep, they did taste just like home-made :)  The sauce is nothing spectacular - we are used to restaurants that have their own signature sauce but I didn't think there was anything spectacular about their sauce either.  We didn't try the pulled pork while we were there.

The portions are huge - I will give them that. 

Maybe it was an off-day for the kitchen - but I don't think I could give it more than 3 stars."	3	TC's Rib Crib	3.5
"Let me start off by saying that I'm spoiled by Bacchanal Buffet, so there's probably a little bias in my review of this place.

For $40 each, my friends and I hit up this spot for a quick bite before hitting the town. Needless to say, we were all very unimpressed by the selection of food here. It is very diverse, but also was unappealing and in my honest opinion not very tasty. I like to destroy several plates at a buffet, but here... I only did 1 dish. I wasn't motivated to seek or eat more. Very unfortunate, because the service was decent here. But that doesn't make up for the meal.

I had the assorted seafood, sushi, mixed veggies and some steak. The crab legs were opened which was cool, but very small in proportion. You'd need several to feel like you're eating something. The sushi, as expected, was fishy and the rice was hard from coldness and sitting around. The steak was chewy (I didn't expect it to be filet or anything), and also not flavorful. Everything made my stomach... apathetic, to say?

Nothing here is specifically awful, but for a place as exquisite as the MGM, I would have expected much better out of them. Next time I'm in town I'll play it safe and come for lunch if things seem different.

Actually, no. I'm going back to Bacchanal."	2	MGM Grand Buffet	2.5
"Old school eating at the oldest steakhouse in Vegas!

My companion and I greatly enjoyed our steak dinners at this restaurant. My friend went for the 22oz Ribeye while I opted for the leaner 16oz New York Strip. A giant glass of aged Chianti and a couple slices of warm bread later we received our meals. Aside from the red wine, our giant slabs of meat were the only contrast to our predominantly white dinner setup. It really makes the meal stand out, and for me to dive right in!

Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection and I was especially satisfied with mine. No need for extra garnishments, no steak sauce. Just pure, unadulterated meat. I really wish I could have ate it all but I easily hit my limit. I also wished that I had room for dessert after seeing a few of the waiters flambe some Cherries Jubilee right next to us.

Our server was very attentive, informative and made sure our glasses of wine stayed full. His formality is top notch and really reflected the establishment well. I really appreciated the recommendations, if you're open minded, definitely hear the staff out when inquiring about what to order.

Attentive and well-paced service accompanied by excellent food is a win-win for me, especially in a city where I always lose. I will definitely be back for more during my next visit in town!"	5	Golden Steer Steakhouse	4
"This place is awesome! My fav sushi spot in vegas.

"Das Boot. Paddles. Chicken Dances. Line Dancing. Table Top Singing. Stein Holding Contests.

Hofbräuhaus is not just a restaurant, it's a place of fun and pure revelry. Aside from the Stein holding contest, I participated in everything mentioned in some fashion. It was so much fun I needed video evidence of the festivities (or maybe I just blacked out).

Despite a packed house and a noisy party going on at every corner, our server was attentive and very quick with our orders and food. I opted for the 2 liter boot, because why not, it's Vegas. I also started off with the soup which had a savory chicken broth accompanied with a giant meatball. It was so good I destroyed the meatball and gulped the broth down as fast as I could. For my main course, I had the Currywurst. I've never eaten a meal so fast in my life. I don't know if it was drunken munchies, or I was super hungry, but I should have choked to death that night. In any case, the curry was delicious, not too spicy or strong. I'm used to Thai and Indian curries, so I would have preferred it that way but it was amazing in its own right. I actually dipped my fries in the sauce so I could eat it all. In hindsight, should have asked if rice was offered here!

I cleaned up all my food, and was super satisfied. After all the shenanigans, I stumbled out happily with my drinking boot and a numb rear end. I can't wait to come back for more pleasure and pain!"	5	Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas	3.5
"Thanks to Nobu, I can't truly enjoy Japanese cuisine in my hometown anymore. I've been ruined and awakened at the same time.

As advocated by our very knowledgeable and professional waiter, we had more of an experience than a meal. The usual inquires were made about our tastes and any allergies, then the rest was in the restaurant's hands. I'm glad they took the wheel, and they did not disappoint.

We were served several courses, each topping the next, and as time progressed my friends and I were looking at each other wondering when we were going to hit the finish line. Needless to say I was quite stuffed at the end and so was everyone else.

The highlights of the night were:

-The Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, with a nice salty, citrus, and spicy finish to it. I wish I had asked for a second plate of it.
-Miso Cod: Dear Lord, I don't know how to explain it. If I ever get framed for murder and end up on death row, I'll chose this as my last meal. I can still taste that sweet and savory sauce with that flaked  fish meat. Even the skin of it was amazing.
-Sushi Platter- Needs no explanation, the rice was at the perfect texture, the fish was oh-so fresh, and i didn't even need wasabi to add to it. I wanted to eat it in its pure form. Simply delightful.

The Mochi ice cream was a great finish, but I was too stuffed to try. My friends thoroughly enjoyed it though, and I trust their tastes. I finished my cocktail and had an espresso as a pick-me-up before starting my long night exploring the town.

Overall, I felt the food, service, and drinks were all on point. It was also moderately priced compared to the other restaurants we dined at, and given it's in Vegas, I don't expect anything to be cheap. We were content with our bill while being cognizant of the service and meal we received. I extremely look forward to eating here again when I return!"	5	Nobu	4
"Buffet Bliss!

I came here with the recommendation of fellow Yelper Rose V. and my experience was super content. Bacchanal Buffet boasts high quality meals from almost all cuisine backgrounds, and I wish I had a second stomach to try them all. Their Asian cuisine was so-so but I don't expect every single station to be a hit. Italian, Seafood, Chinese, Sushi, Carved Meats, Breakfast items... I gotta eat them all! Their dessert section also tasted as amazing as it looked. This place is a little more pricey than they other buffets but it's certainly well worth the cost.

Aside from the awesome food and ambiance, the service is decent. One thing that puzzled me was the wait to get a table. I came for lunch with a friend, and it was not packed at all. Though we were in front, they seated other 3 and 4 tops that were in line behind and to the sides of us. I was kind of confused, but the awesome meal made up for it. Perhaps they wanted to induce increased hunger in their patrons so they'd eat more? 

I have no qualms with that!"	4	Bacchanal Buffet	4
The food is good but we seriously waited for at least 34 minutes for a burger, a dawg and a fish sandwich.    The service is really not first class.  Our water had a bug in it and it took long time for my daughter to get the replacement.  And the server did not say anything like we were the trouble maker who made a big deal out of it.  It was not a big deal for us until we saw how the service was turned out.  Also, we asked for takeout the left over and our server offered to wrap them for us, which was great until she piled up our food on top of each other.  The bottom of the plates were touching the food.   Seriously?  I wonder how she does that at her house.  I cannot imagine a fine restaurant like burgr had a such a weak trained service team.  It's a shame.	1	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4

Obviously a Chinese restaurant in a Las Vegas hotel won't be good.  Really nothing special here at all. The onion pancakes were bland, the chow mein was greasy and bland, the Shanghai dumplings were bland, there was barely any juicy soup inside the dumpling-which is what makes the dish!  Steamed Shrimp Har gow was the only edible item.  Overpriced and not good at all, SKIP THIS PLACE!!	2	Zine Noodles Dim Sum	3

"I would come here for the french fries alone!! SO good! I really love crispy fries and their fries are thin and flat so its almost like chips. I got the classique steak which was alright, very thinly cut, but the texture of the meat was a little too mushy for my taste. Maybe it would taste better if I ordered medium rare instead of medium.

Ambiance is great especially if you sit outside, you get a view of the Bellagio fountains. Very sweet and romantic!"	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4

"Let me start by saying I love the Flamingo Hotel.  Stay there all the time.  But this is a horrible buffet.  Horrible.  The food choices are boring (and limited) and the quality is low at best.  This is just a Golden Corral in a better room. And the room isn't that much better. 

I would never recommend this pace, not for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Too expensive, not good.  Pay an extra dollar or two and go to one of the nicer buffets in the area."	1	Paradise Garden Buffet	2.5
"Amazing.

Magical cows.  Yes, magical cows grazing on magical grass. On a magical farm.  Cows who willingly provide magical milk for the shakes and give their lives to create the greatest hamburgers ever made.  It's the only explanation I can come up with.

I'm not a big fan of the Gordon Ramsay 'Hell's Kitchen' show like many who frequent BurGR are.  I've seen maybe two episodes at best.  So when people started pointing at the executive chef, I had to Google her from the name embroidered on her chef's uniform.  Turns out she won Season Ten.  I didn't care, but that's kind of interesting.  But not as interesting as my meal.

I normally wouldn't wait in line 30 minutes for a meal at a burger joint, but I was dining alone and there was a very short wait to eat at the counter. I'd heard good things so it seemed an ideal opportunity to try it out.  Next time I'm in town, I'll happily wait 30 minutes, an hour or however long it takes because it's well worth the wait. 

The menu includes some selection of appetizers (onion rings looked amazing) and a selection of about ten burgers.  They had salads and some other stuff, but really why bother?  There is a fancy hot dog that seemed popular, but I was focused on getting one of these famous burgers I have heard about.

Burgers ranged from the good old American Burger (my choice, a plain cheeseburger the way those magical cows probably intended) to other interesting combinations. One of the specialty burgers involved duck breast bacon and a fried egg.  It's that kind of place.  My burger and the bun were terrific.  It's not cheap ($13 for burger alone) but worth it.  Burgers are  cooked over an apple wood fire or something, which I guess actually makes a difference?  Or it's just the magical cows again. 

Fries include sweet potato, truffle parmesan, and 'just fries' - had the regular fries and the chipotle and curry ketchups were available as well.  Amazing.  Add $9.

Finally, the milkshakes - ranging from creme brulee (my runner up - next time) to coconut to caramel pudding and more.  I chose 'Shake #3' which included a banana milkshake covered in butterscotch pudding and topped with a snickerdoodle cookie.  It was SOOOOOO good it has at the very least tied the Twinkie shake at BLT Burger for best shake ever.  I may need to conduct a side-by-side taste test next time I'm in town.  Add another $9.  Yes, $9 for a shake.  Worth every penny.

The ambiance is great and, if you are into the whole 'celebrity chef' thing, you'll love it even more.  Service was prompt and super-friendly, and the food, as I said, is wonderful.  It's the magical cows.  

The whole meal, just a burger, fries and milkshake, came to about $40 with tip.  Yes, $40 for a basic burger and fries.  Again repeat after me. . . . worth. every. penny.

Kudos, Gordon Ramsay.  I didn't think I'd every pay that kind of money for a burger.  But I did, and I will again.  When you visit your magical farm please tell the cows I thank them for their service!"	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
"I have a really hard time reviewing this place.  It's Las Vegas and there are many better places to eat within a block or two of the Tropical Breeze.  But I usually stay at the Flamingo and after a late night of gambling, it's just soooooo convenient to eat here.  And the food isn't bad, it just isn't 'special' in any way.  It's decent food, decent portions, decent prices and all just a few steps from the elevator.  I can roll out of bed, hit the cafe and be at the pool in no time.

I'd recommend the cinnamon roll french toast, or maybe the belgian waffle - both are great.  They also make a mean omelet.  

Lines can be long - if you're Platinum of Diamond level of the Total Rewards program you can skip the line - my favorite perk of Total Rewards - but otherwise there is often a little bit of a wait - but the line moves pretty quickly.  

Haven't had lunch or dinner here.  I guess I'm usually up and awake enough by then to venture out into the sunlight and find something a bit more exciting.  But for that early morning breakfast when you're too sluggish to get out and walk the strip, it's a great option.

Bonus:  It's vegas and you can play Keno while you eat."	3	Tropical Breeze Cafe	2.5
"The service was really good!
I had the shrimp tacos which were good, but small. I also had a Margarita which nice and strong. I might be back to try the trash can nachos"	4	Guy Fieri's El Burro Borracho	3.5
The food is delicious and the staff are extremely friendly. I've ordered take out a few times and have never been disappointed. Love this place and will continue to eat here!	5	Lucki Thai	4.5
This is my favorite taco restaurant in town!! I love how their tacos taste so authentic. I always get lengua (beef tongue) and adobada (spicy pork) tacos with every topping in it. Today I tried my first mula and it was amazing.. Mula is kinda like a quesadilla where they put cheese on top of a taco and put another piece of tortilla. Everything comes out super fast so you don't have to wait so long.	5	Tacos El Gordo	4.5
10\/10 I would definitely come back! I got the medium spice level today and it was awesome! I got a pound of shrimp and they were pretty big!	5	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
My favorite food from this place is probably the salad bowl. Don't underestimate before you even try it! Their salad bowl has rice, beans, choice of meat, lettuce, guac, and hand made tortilla! Don't forget to ask for the house dressing aka the green sauce haha	4	Cafe Rio	2.5
This is probably one of the best korean bbq restaurants in Vegas. Their customer service level is higher than any other places that they're fast at serving and they even grill the meats for you! They get pretty busy during Friday night and weekend so expect to wait about an hour. I recommend getting family combo than ordering individual meat by serving since you get to try different type of meat with reasonable price. Don't forget to try their unique Korean style icecream sandwich at the end!	5	Hobak Korean BBQ	4.5
I like how their korean food is not super Americanized because some restaurants make it Americanized to attract more non-Korean customers. This place gets pretty busy on the weekends including Friday nights so I would try callimg them first and see what the waiting time is. Other than that, their food is super delicious and the waiter and waitresses are quick and polite. It might be a little bit far if anyone is trying to go here from the strip but it's definitely worth it.	5	Soyo Korean Barstaurant	4
One of the best curry restaurants I've been to! I normally get chicken katsu curry with spicy level 8-10. The spicy level is from 0 (least spicy) and 10 (super spicy) but 8-10 is not hot to the point that you can't even enjoy it. The restaurant is not that big so it can get packed during lunch peak time. Customer service 10\/10, food quality 10\/10	5	Japanese Curry Zen	4.5
All the workers are nice and they took time to explain what's in each dish. I had this grilled cheese plate called Croque Madam and this is probably one of the best grilled cheese I've had so far! It came with fresh salad and it seemed pretty fresh. They also have really good pastries, especially chocolate almond crossaint.	5	La Belle Terre Bread French Bakery Café	4
I've always been to the one in Flamingo and it was my first time at the Tivoli location. Similar interior designs and same menu as other location but slightly more fancy and less crowded. It's a great place to grab drinks with friends and watch sports games. This place is not as fun as the Flamingo one because it doesn't have all the board games and beer pong set up.	4	Pkwy Tavern	3.5
I would say this was my first time trying Cantonese food and it was very different but actually delicious. We had this filet mignon plate, pork with salty fish, dumplings, and crab with fried rice. To be honest, all these plates were pretty saucy and salty so I would recommend to eat white rice on the side. They also gave us this hot red bean with mandarin orange in it(?) for dessert and that was really good! The staffs were very friendly and the restaurant was nice and clean.	4	Taste	4
Can't say anything bad about In-N-Out because it's just so good! I always get a dougle-double with grilled onion and hot chili peppers in it and it's so delicious! Don't get the hot chili pepper if spicy is an issue since it's pretty spicy.. don't forget to get the animal style fries!	5	In-N-Out Burger	4
Love Korean food? Love hotdogs? This is it.. they're the one and only Korean fusion hotdog restaurant in town. It's just so good. My favorite is Angry Kimchi hotdog and Sweet potato kimchi fries. It's got fried kimchi and pork in it. They also have other good ones like Gangnam hotdog. Me and my buddies each ordered one hotdog and shared one carne asada fries and it was just enough to make all of us full. 10\/10 I would definitely go back and try other food on the menu!	5	Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dogs	4.5
Hands down best sushi in town. A lot of people including myself don't have high expections for the fish quality when choosing all you can eat, but this restaurant is completely different. I've been to Sushi Neko for years and their food has been always fresh and good. Their fish to rice ratio is just unbelievable...!! They take reservations so if you have a party of 20+, I would call a week or two before and save spot. If anyone is looking for a sushi restaurant with all you can eat in Vegas, this is it.	5	Sushi Neko	4
You don't have to be super good at golf. You just need to be able to hit a ball, land it on the scoring net and have fun. This place is perfect for a group event since they can take up to 6 people per spot. I guess one down side is that you have to wait so long on the weekends but it will go by fast if you hang out in the main bar area and they will text you when it's your turn. They have a huge tv screen at the bar so you can watch sports games too!	4	Topgolf	4
This was my first time here and it was just so great. I just heard that Brew Tea Milktea which is their signature drink is really good so I ordered it without doubt. This might be too simple for some people but the tea flavor was just strong enough and delicious. I might go with less sweet next time but everything was great. Customer service: 10\/10 drink: 10\/10	5	Brew Tea Bar	5
"Before moving to Vegas I used to frequent a different Japanese restaurant but this one is quite a nice replacement! Our hibachi chef was so entertaining and made our date night dining experience so fun! Everything was cooked perfectly. I especially loved our japanese lasagna rolls! I could definitely be a regular here! 

The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is bc they don't serve shrimp sauce regularly."	4	Ohjah Japanese Steakhouse	4.5
"I went there yesterday and ordered togo since my baby boy was sleeping in the car. Owners were so nice to delivery my good to my car curbside, take my credit card, then proceed on to give me 2 water bottles for free. 

I ordered the jjajangmyum and meat jun combo with rice rice. Food was so yummy. Best jjajangmyun I had in awhile. Was just as good as Young King's in LA. 

Awesome service and food. Going back there today before we leave to go back home."	5	Island Style Restaurant	4.5
Super cute wine bar inside container park. Had a small bin (mini cheese board) and a few drinks while sitting outside on a couch under a heater people watching. Great service and super trendy fun place to spend an hour.	5	bin 702	4
Amazing little spot away from the craziness! We happened upon this great gastro pub on our way down Freemont Street to Container Park (a must see!). The bartender Fransisco was top notch! He made some great recommendations to us for food and then made a killer cocktail. We loved everything on the menu and settled upon fish and chicken taco specials. If we hadn't had dinner reservations that night we would have tried much more since the pub smelled amazing as the cooks prepped for the dinner crowd. We are hoping to stop in again before we leave Vegas. Prices were super reasonable ($10 for 3 generously sized tacos)  and $10-$12 signature cocktails.	5	The Smashed Pig Gastropub	4.5
"As someone who has lived nearly my entire life in Las Vegas, this is by far the best restaurant in the city. It doesn't matter if you go for their amazing breakfast\/brunch or for dinner to sink your teeth into one of the best steaks you'll ever eat, you'll never be disappointed in the the quality of food and service.

Special thank you to Derek for a nice welcome back for me and my wife from Korea."	5	Echo & Rig	4.5
"Went there last night for some drinks and a quick bite to eat with friends. Ordered drinks, then food, but after that a good 30-35min passed without a server coming back to check on the table. 

The servers would walk by and ignore the table. It got so and that my buddy got up and went to the bar to order more drinks and I asked two different servers where our food was. When the food finally did arrive, it looked as though it sat under a heat lamp for awhile.

Note: the restaurant was not busy.

As a long time Las Vegas resident, I'm disappointed in both the service and food. Something that is unusual for a Hotel on the Strip.

The restaurant could be a great late night location to eat, but they fell far from that."	2	The Henry	4
"I'm not frequently on the East Side of Las Vegas, but while over here I stopped in at the Pan Ocha Soup Thai restaurant. I will say that this place makes me want to come back again and again! The food is phenomenal and the staff is very nice and welcoming.

I ate at the lunch buffet and hands down their spicy chicken wings and pad Thai noodles are the best! I also ordered the Pad Sew Ewe and it was meaty and flavorful!

Also, the proximity to Nellis AFB is great and they are very welcoming to the military!

Will definitely come back again!"	5	Pon Ocha Soup	4.5
Nacho Daddy...is daddy. I had the best taco salad of my life there and they had an entire vegan menu. SO SO good 10\/10. I wish they had locations in AZ! I think it would do well there!	5	Nacho Daddy	4
"I absolutely love this place. I have been here twice and always leave happy! 

It's definitely a little hidden gem stowed away in Chinatown. Small quiet cozy place and great for a date or even to bring the kids. 

It's a fusion of Japanese and Italian and everything is so delicately put together. For appetizers I have had the bruschetta and I just can't decide which is my favorite they all melt in your mouth. However I leave the place and crave the tuna bruschetta. The octopus with wasabi sauce is fantastic. I also had the beef carpaccio amazing!! We ordered the cheese platter and to my surprise it was great!! Usually I don't get that excited about cheese platters but definitely a must order.

For entrees I have been quite boring and both times ordered the Uni wild scallop tomato cream sauce pasta. I die and go to heaven every time I eat this. On one of my visits my Boyfriend ordered the squid ink pasta and I loved that too. But if your wearing white or have an engagement after dinner not the best choice your teeth will be black and if your like me it will be on your top no matter how hard you tried not to splatter. 

Great waitresses excellent wine list and by the glass. This place is on my top 5 places in Vegas!!"	5	Trattoria Nakamura-Ya	4.5
As a New Yorker living in Las Vegas I must say this is THE REAL DEAL!!! Delicious crispy thin cheesy HOT slice!!! The black cherry soda just paired this slice perfectly.  Great customer service.	5	Inna Gadda di Pizza	4.5
Love the cleanliness of this place, their staff is always friendly even when lunch time rush hits.  I LOVE coming in later on in the day and seeing everyone prep the food.  Real home cooking and no fatty fast food tacos.  My favorite i the 3 taco plate carnitas, birria and carne asada extra green sauce please.  Plus kuddos for the military discount because on any given day you will see a military member in uniform.	5	Saborr	4
We found this hidden gen a month ago and we cant get enough.  Friendly, CLEAN and most important authentic Thai food.  The service is quick and perfectly located outside of base housing.  My fav is the Chicken Pad Thai and the pot stickers!	5	Narong's Thai Kitchen	4.5
Be sure to ask how big the portions are! My wife and I could have split one order and still left food on the plate. Great value for breakfast.	5	House of Blues - Music Venue	3.5
"Pros:
- Warm pistachios when you sit down
- Fresh french fries (yes, one of my 4 food groups)
- Steak anything. We had the skirt steak and it was incredible. Our neighboring table was exclaiming about theirs.
- Sexy cocktails 
- Fabulous ambiance 

Cons:
- My trout had too much lemon and I was too drunk to have the presence of mind to send it back. Boo.

The verdict:
How do you say bon appetit in French? Oh."	4	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4

"Crepes in the Paris. NAWWWWWW!!! SHOCKER!

Me and 7 of my girlfriends stopped by La Creperie on the recommendation of one of our group. Usually I like as little fuss as possible with my crepes, so I was a little disappointed not to see a plain old butter and sugar on there, though I also didn't ask if they would make one to try it out. Not even a crepe suzette! I had the D'Anjou - a pear, almond paste, caramel, whipped cream and walnut concoction

The pears were so-so and mixed with the paste, produced a not super flavorful milky juice that kinda grossed me out and the whipped cream was a bit ""cool whip"" tasting. I did manage to make it almost all the way through, however because the crepe itself was delicious.

My friend had the seafood crepe, which I got to when it was a little cold. It was buttery and I imagine very good warm, but the bechamel sauce on the top was a little floury. 

I'd go again, but I'd order butter and sugar or strawberries."	3	La Creperie	3.5
"Not sure if it's a ""Meh.."" or more of a ""Eh..."" that I'm looking for.

$200 for dinnah for 2 people? Dang. The half lobster was fishy and not great (though this may be the first lobster I have had not sitting on a dock in Maine) and had very little actual meat. 

The cottage fries are actually homemade potato chips and shoestring onion rings. Great in theory except they get cold faster than you can eat them and end up tasting exactly like the grease they were fried in. Blech.

I had the clam spaghetti. Very average.My boyfriend had the filet mignon. Also normal.

Aside from the averageness of everything, HOLY @#%! there is one reason to go to Palm. THE CHEESECAKE!!!!!!! The best cheesecake I've ever had. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Fly to Vegas now. Eat somewhere else, but go to Palm for cheesecake for dessert."	3	The Palm Las Vegas	4
"I consider french fries one of the four food groups, along with cheese, red wine and sushi.

Super salty, crispy on the outside and served with a trident. This is the place to be at 2am when you drunkenly decide to forsake your nutritious eating routine."	4	Nathan's Famous	3
"Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.

Be prepared to drop some cash, but it will be worth it. Excellent, well-prepared, delicate, well-thought out dishes. We came with a huge party for my friend's bachelorette party and let the waiter order for us. 

The highlight was the tuna tartare. Crispy jalapenos gave it an excellent spice and texture and the sauce was excellent. The lychee martinis are like candy. 

Great atmosphere too. During dinner, the Treasure Island pirate performance took place and we watched part of it from the balcony of the restaurant. The servers were great and the waiters tolerant of all the sexual harassment that came their way from our party. ;)"	5	Social House	4
"A big WHA WHA!

Didn't wait long because I was with a group of 6 girls but then found it was a $20 cover.  Since it was late, we decided to screw it, but as we were walking out, got handed free passes, so we turned around and went back in.

Awesome interior, but the point of a nightclub is to dance. You can't dance if you're wedged up against 600 other sweaty, wasted people. I don't care how good you look coming in, you're gonna look nasty if you're sweaty and wasted regardless.

I can imagine if you're really tore up however, it might be a strategic move to shove your way in to the middle of the crowd, since it's virtually impossible to fall down with all those people holding you up.

Also, those girls in the pools are really depressing. When nice girls say hello and ask you how you're doing and you stare blankly ahead and strike a pose from a foot away, you look like you've been trafficked. Either that or you just have to get wasted to make it through your shift."	2	Tao Nightclub	3
"Bloody. Mary. Bar. With. Slim. Jims. (as a garnish) In. Vegas.

That makes up for the fact that my boyfriend's poached egg was underdone.

But then again, sitting on the patio watching the Bellagio fountain and drunk people whilst drinking Bloody Marys does too."	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"Mediocre at best! Chairs were dirty that you sat in that should have been a sign! Servers we're both rude put out if you asked for anything such as water refill or clean plate! Overcharged on the food we ordered and the food was very bland! Spicy eggplant was good mixed vegetables with chicken horrible with no flavor!
First time and last time! If you want the best Thai food in town go to WEERA on west Sahara"	2	Thai Style Noodle House	4
Lived in Las Vegas over 20 years first time ever going in to this establishment tonight must say the chips salsa and bean dip were fantastic!!! I also had a mango margarita which was delicious as well as the Carnitas dinner which was also fantastic! My husband ordered a combo dinner with a pork tamale beef taco and chili releno also very very good! The staff was super friendly and courteous and welcoming I would definitely recommend this restaurant for food and service	5	Casa Don Juan  - Summerlin	4
I would have to say that I have been going to Parma since they opened and it is slowly gone downhill between the quality of food the quality of service as well as portions... It is quite disappointing however every time I go in there I see Chef Mark is walking around the restaurant rather than in the back cooking maybe hence that is part of the problem!!! I believe you get what you pay for however in this case I feel they have now become overpriced for a poor quality of Italian food as well as very small portions!!! I would recommend they get some new servers as well as new items on the menu or give you at least a fair portion for the price they are charging... So many better other kind restaurants in town that appreciate your business	1	Parma By Chef Marc	4
"Food was great and so
Was the service! Great quality and would highly recommend it! Try the chile relenos it was out of this world"	5	Viva Mercado's Mexican Bar & Grill	4
We really enjoyed this place!!! We found it through Yelp and the reviews were right on the money!!! The Pad Se Ew was off the hook and so was there Spicy Eggplant!!! Fresh ingredients and quality as well... Would highly recommend it too anyone!!!	4	Weera Thai Restaurant	4
"This place is absolutely the worst to begin with when the hostess sat us asked what we wanted to drink said water to begin with and never saw him again! About 10 minutes later a server don't know his name came to the table didn't introduce himself asked if someone got our drinks we said not sure host asked  but never brought them said what do you want to order to eat said I'm not sure yet and walked away with attitude and eye rolling! Came back eventually with the water and  I asked if I could order a lemonade since it was homemade and he walked a way abruptly again with attitude like I was putting him out!  By this point I was done with the putting him out attitude and went to the bartender to ask if a manager could be sent to the table debating if we should just leave and go to m&m soul food which there service and food blows this place out of the water! In the meantime a different food server came to try to get our food order but really hadn't decided to stay or go yet and then the manager eventually shows up
With lots of excuses like her server the one with the attitude acting like anything I asked or said without putting him out with his rolling eyes and walking away that he must have been upset because he didn't really want to be there and he was working later than he was supposed to my response was then cut them from the floor it's bad for your business for a customer not to feel welcome in an establishment that you have  been sitting in
 for approximately a half hour is unacceptable in my book... in the meantime after her making tons of excuses and what not she offered to bring some fried green tomatoes to the table and switched servers still felt quite uncomfortable in there this was approximately 6 o'clock on a Sunday night and I guess supposedly they close at 6 o'clock according to the manager said one of the hostesses just sent a customer away saying that we close in 10 minutes we also heard another server at a table behind us tell customers they couldn't order anything to go which I thought again with strange since food was still coming out the impression is very lazy service in there and you are constantly having to flag people down to try to get their attention when they come to the table they come off as if there you're doing you a favor or that you're just simply putting them out! The food took a long time to come out when it was brought to the table one of the chicken breast we noticed looked like it was very old and dry and it was totally different from the other pieces and sure enough after cutting into it was exactly what we thought dry and like it had been sitting there all day under a heat lamp asked if they would remake that piece of chicken again got attitude and was told it would take 5 to 8 minutes.... well it literally took them
 a half an hour! Lastly at 6 o'clock you can hear the entire kitchen staff so loud you could hear per Batum their conversations as they act like they're having a party one talking louder than the next while we were sitting very far from the kitchen Side of the restaurant actually and yet that's all you could hear the employees acting as if they didn't have any cares in the world it  very disrespectful and very unpleasant to listen to.... followed up by blaring loud music again so that the employees can have a great time still four or five tables in the restaurant and they're blasting people out it was so uncomfortable I had asked for them to turn the music down as it was giving me a headache!!! My recommendation is avoid this place like the plague the food is nothing to write home about and the service is ridiculous these people act like they're beneath serving anybody shame on them and coming from being a former food server  I certainly wasn't working for the minimum wage I was getting paid for they need customer service skills taught  to them badly and management The general manager actually seem to be intimidated by the workers and out of control of the entire restaurant all she did was make excuses one after the other!!! Go to m&m soul  food you will not be disappointed they originated in East LA they are as nice as pie when you come in and can't do enough to give you good service and great food with a smile on their face"	1	Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles	3
Absolutely love Egg and I been coming here as long as I can remember!!! The staff is amazing as well as the quality of food and the menu is quite selective!!! Their motto is eggsactly  what you want and they mean that!!! We eat here at least four or five times a week and it is always a homerun!!! Best breakfast and lunch in Las Vegas as well as a very well ran business!!! Brad is one half of a business owner and as you can see there is never turnover in any of his four locations soon-to-be five!!! In this town you are as good as your last meal!!!	5	Egg & I	4.5
This place was absolutely fantastic!!! We are big-time yelpers and neither one of us are the huge fans of Chinese food both very picky when it comes to it!!! With that said we locate at this place with her the less than a couple of miles from our house from the time we walked in super friendly service everything we ordered was absolutely fantastic!!! From the war wonton soup the honey walnut shrimp Hong Kong noodles as well as their egg rolls absolutely to die for!!!! Their portions are huge and the leftovers are even better the next day!!! Would definitely try delivery next time as the reviews are great on it and I believe everything would come piping hot as well as top-quality	5	China Hot Wok	4
Ordered the hummus to start. It was mediocre and the side salad was inedible on account of excessive garlic. The small cheese pizza was also not particularly good. The sauce was too sweet and the cheese was of low quality. Lastly, the pasta dish ordered was uninspired. They charged $4 for a few shrimp thrown on to the pasta. There is no way that we will return to this restaurant. Due Forni is MUCH better.	2	Pizza Lounge	3.5
We have been going there since they opened it was good for the first couple of times and quickly went downhill with service quality and poor management... tonight we went in our servers name was Chaz Took him a while to get to the table to get a drink water then he seem to be rushing us with the food order we ordered an appetizer as well as dinner he never offered us Bread we had to  ask somebody else to bring it then he never bothered to clear any of the appetizer plates for salad plate that was left at the side of the table... our entrées came out my husband ordered an ahi burger which was still frozen we had to hunt down a server to help flag down our own server down to let him know our server then came back to the table with the gentleman that originally flagged him down to let us know that we were right they touched it in the back and it was frozen good to know that they're touching food to verify what customers are telling them... my husband ended up getting very turned off and not ordering anything I ate a couple of bites of my Greek chicken salad then again proceeded to look for our server which took about 15 minutes to flag him down at which time I told him I wanted a box as well as the check another 15 minute passes he comes with the Check but  no box at which time I asked to see the manager!!! The general managers name I believe was Gary who was doing nothing but standing at the hostess desk the entire time for a manager to not come to our table knowing there was an issue with the food and for us to have to request them to come up or was just complete failure once again.... I explained to him how long we've been coming there that we even need the previous general manager Monica as well as the owner and I've met him on a few occasions he made a bunch of shit poor excuses quite frankly proceeded to grab my credit card and go run our bill when he came back with the $27 check I said really shame on you knowing how much you guys drop the ball that you would even think of charging for a salad that had three bites taken out of it and a couple of beers that were three dollars apiece on happy hour what a joke!!! I let him know as we were exiting that I was leaving zero tip because that was zero service and I would never come back to this establishment again save your money and go elsewhere they may be a half a mile up the street but I would drive out of my way to go anywhere else other than this place! It is a revolving door for servers as well as management and I can definitely see why if that's who's running the establishment this guy that doesn't know how to accommodate or make anything right this place will be closed within the next six months to a year I will bet on it!!! This is from a person that eats almost every meal out to breakfast lunch and dinner because of my schedule this was a casual dinner for us and it absolutely sucked IHOP would've been better...	1	FireRock Steakhouse	3.5
My husband and I have been coming to this location for years and must say it is out of this world!!! Iggy the owner is as welcoming as they come! He makes you feel like you are a family member as well as the rest of the staff! Pam who has been my favorite server and I followed her for years is truly a gem and cannot do a enough for you!!! Their food is amazing and I cannot recommend this place enough I have lived in Vegas for over 20 years and it is definitely one of my favorite breakfast joints!!! You will not be disappointed I can promise!!!	5	Omelet House Summerlin	4
"Tried this place for the first time. Two things that sum up Saffron:

1. Not a single Indian person was eating there
2. They serve spring rolls and hawaiian chicken in the buffet

There you have it. This is watered-down Indian food made for gum-chewing Americans. If you want more authentic Indian food then go somewhere else. Big disappointment."	2	Saffron Flavors of India	4
This review is based on the falafel sandwich. I'm a big champion of small but authentic holes in the wall, but based on the falafel, this is not one of them. Chickpeas were not crunchy or well spiced. The sauce was unrecognizable. Lack of veggies. There are much better falafels in town.	2	Baladie Café	4
I'm reviewing the cheesesteak only...I lived in Philly for 3 years so of course this cheesesteak doesn't match up to Philly but it is still quite tasty. It's in the style and has the flavor of Jim's on South Street, not like Geno's or Pat's. I give it 4 stars for taste but I knocked it down a star because the sandwich is not that big (was still hungry after eating it) and it costs 11 bucks. Not a great value.	3	Those Guys Pies	4
"No AYCE here, but don't despair. The best deal seems to be ordering 2 a la carte meats, which will feed 2 adults, 2 kids for about same price or less as AYCE elsewhere. You get salad, steamed egg and soybean paste soup too. 
At lunch we were seated quickly, banchan served immediately and the meats were grilling before we knew it. The bulgogi marinade was great. Even the rice you can tell is of higher quality than usual.
This place definitely will draw us away from Korean bbq in Chinatown and it's a lot closer.
Only drawback might be how busy Ann Road and Centennial Dr have gotten, but oh well, Vegas is booming."	5	Moo Woo Korean BBQ	4.5
Major disappointment. Was hoping the all-you-can-eat would be good enough to pull me away from my favorite in town (Goyemon, which is far from me and has declined a bit in quality lately) but Naka falls short. The fish is reasonably fresh and portions are good for nigiri but the amount of rice is too large, disproportionate to the fish and too glutinous with the grains lacking separation. For sushi, the rice quality is paramount, something that is lost in many sushi places in the US. Sloppy presentation and a lack of refinement. Number of choices for nigiri is also limited compared to other places. Won't be back and better to pay more at another sushi joint.	2	Naka Sushi	4
Good, not great. It's not really a brunch, just buffet breakfast. No lunch items at all. Some in our group lamented the lack of a carving station. The breads were really disappointing: included dry sliced bread that was pre-packaged,  not fresh. Oatmeal could have been mistaken for that served at a free buffet at Courtyard Marriott. No way that this is better than Mozen, which closed their amazing Sunday brunch except for special occasions. Veranda brunch has limited items. Cannot compare to the other big buffets in Vegas in terms of variety. I expected better from Four Seasons.	3	Veranda	4
I'm reviewing the falafel. Best in town, full stop. I tried them almost everywhere and none beats Sababa. Warm fluffy bread, crispy and perfect chickpeas, jam packed with fresh veggies and hummus. You've gotta try it, just remember they're closed on Saturdays for sabbath.	5	Sababa Mediterranean Grill	3.5
As much as I avoid jumpong on bandwagons, I'm jumping gleefully on this one. Finally got to try Brew Tea Bar with the family. We ordered the Hokkaido milk tea because of all the raves. Tried the taro and strawberry slushes. They were all great and it seems to me their entire menu must be delicious. It's hard to describe what the Hokkaido tastes like, but you should definitely give it a try.	5	Brew Tea Bar	5
"The negative reviews here are rather ridiculous. First of all, Tamba is all about the buffet. Don't bother ordering off the menu and you won't be complaining about bad service or long wait times for your food. Here's why Tamba has the best Indian buffet in town:

1. Huge selection with plenty of veggie options. I don't  think there's a bigger Indian buffet in Vegas.
2. Buffet is not set up against a wall so you can go down the row on both sides. No waiting!
3. Great naan and great rice. These are key.
4. All you can eat gulab jamin dessert. So good.
5. Friendly staff. We've been going for years and the owners, staff etc have always been extremely cordial to us.
6. 30 bucks for 2 adults and 2 kids. Hard to beat that.
7. Great recipes of standard dishes that should satisfy most everyone.
8. The place has Indian folks arriving in big numbers. There is no way an entire Indian family would go there and bring their non-English speaking, sari-adorned grandma, who happily eats with her hands, if this wasn't the real deal.
9. Free parking. Pay 5 bucks next door at the lot and you get it back with your receipt when you leave. Sweet!"	5	Tamba	3.5
A bit disappointed. First time there, i ordered the brisket sandwich to go. Good smokey flavor but it was small, not much meat, no slaw, and they gave a small amount of sauce. No way that it's worth 8 bucks. I'll give them another chance though since they are very friendly working the smoker outside.	2	Cody's Smokin' Barbecue	4.5
My search is over. I've sampled innumerable taco joints in Vegas, and while most do a decent job, there's usually something lacking that makes them a one-time stop. At last, I've found El Compita. Been to 2 locations and they are equally good. Best carnitas torta I've tried, in fact everything's great: tacos, mulitas. Two great salsas that you can grab yourself. Great value too. It's like stepping into Mexico itself. The guy in line in front of me had a "13" tattooed on his head, as in the LA gang, and the girl in front of him was probably 6 yrs old carrying a 2 yr old. Almost thought I had to pay in pesos, but if you want the real deal in terms of food, this place hits the spot.	5	Tacos El Compita	4
Review based on lunch and two dinners. You won't be disappointed with the tasty lobster roll for lunch. Nice soft bread and they don't skimp on the lobster.  For dinner had the delicious beet salad and mushroom risotto which was being eyed jealously by my tablemates. It was as good as it looked. Haven't tried anything sub-par at Andrea yet. Hope they stick around.	4	Andre's Bistro & Bar	4
"I stayed here during Labor Day weekend (Friday afternoon until Sunday afternoon) and had no troubles except for parking. I was confused as to which driveway was the main one to find valet parking so we ended up doing the self-parking (which is okay but it would have been nice to have more distinctive signs up). Our check-in was originally around 2PM but since we got in around 1PM, I asked if we could check in early and there was no issue. Our room was a bit stuffy but after you turned on the air conditioning, it felt fine.

The wallpaper in the bathroom looked a bit old so that was a bit strange but other than that, the room did the job for the weekend. We were barely in it anyway. One thing that probably would have made our experience better - room service. I found out they did have room service on our way out but it was not clear on the room telephone options. Anyway, for about $100\/night, this was a doable room for LDW."	3	Riviera Hotel & Casino	2.5
I write this from a bathroom at Albertsons, reflecting on the life choices that have brought me to this location. It all started when I decided to get lunch from this food truck. As a fan of Greek food, I was so excited at the prospect of enjoying a chicken kabob lunch that I didn't mind standing in line under the grueling Las Vegas sun for 15 minutes to place my order. However, when it was time to place said order, I was informed that my savory kabob dish was no longer available. Saddened, but not deterred, I ordered a rice bowl instead.  By the time I got my order 30 minutes later, my soul was discouraged and my skin was slightly darkened but I still clung to hope at the prospect of a good meal. The rice bowl itself was quite tasty and flavorful with chicken, rice, tomatoes, onions, and feta cheese. Tons of feta cheese. I almost thought it had been worth the 45 minute wait under the sun. But that was before the wrath of Hades had unleashed on my stomach nearly two hours later. I was casually working at my desk when the first ominous grumble hit. I brushed it off, but after a few minutes I realized that there was no escaping this terrible fate. Three trips to the bathroom later, I knew I wasn't going to make it at work until 5 so I left so I could at least suffer in peace at home. Except I didn't make it home either, which is the reason I am now confined in a bathroom stall at Albertsons. Overall, if you don't mind long wait times and Medusa's hair slithering in and wreaking havoc on your intestines, this food is amazing. However if you value your time and your stomach, there are probably better alternatives.	1	Greek Delights	4
"I always assess a buffet by its prime rib, nothing else. If you're going to a buffet for Mexican food, you're doing it wrong. 

The wait for this place was not long- they seem to bus the tables very quick and have a good system down. The cooks were very friendly and didn't seem irritated that we were there. The food was organized well and you could find what you were looking for very quickly. The prime rib was bomb! I ate soooo much. I will come here again."	4	Spice Market Buffet	3
"Service: 0\/5 
So.... There are SIXTEEN seats at this bar. It is literally a BAR. That's it. One bar. With 16 seats. Just wanted to make that clear. The line is not long but you wait FOREVER. They must be short staffed because the bus boy was also the cook (so of course he took forever to clear plates and set up for new guests). There were plenty of times where 2-4 seats were open but the people in front of us could not sit down yet because the spots needed to be cleared. There were probably 8 people in front of us and we waited for TWO HOURS. Excuse my French but f&%k that!!! Never again!!!!!!!!!!! Once we were seated, it took about 15-20 minutes for our food to be ready so by that time, we were desperately drinking our water and ate our oysters way too fast.

Food: 2.5\/5
The oysters were very good. Even though they looked like they had been given steroids to grow as big as they were, they were delicious. The gumbo, on the other hand, was awful. I barely finished mine. I wish the oysters could make up for the gumbo but both dishes were sooooo expensive. So nope, they did not make up for the gumbo being gross.

Overall experience: 1.5 (giving them two because I feel bad kind of....)
I will never go to this place again. I live near San Francisco so I will never take my SF oysters for granted again. LOL."	2	Oyster Bar	4.5
"Best buffet I have ever been to! Great variety of all kinds of food plus their prime rib is divine :P 

But don't come here on Thanksgiving-the line gets wild!!!! (Or any holiday actually, I'm sure it is the same but if you do, make sure you tip well because these people most likely work every holiday). 

I would call ahead just in case to see how long the line is, depending on the day\/time."	4	Carnival World Buffet	3.5
"Annie L-the comment about your wallet crying and your tummy hungry is on point. I like your style haha *snaps|props* 

Anyway, I know everything on the strip is pretty expensive and I definitely should have Yelped this place before going in... My mistake, I know. However, I had just arrived in LV, checked into the Venetian and my hotel room key had SUSHISAMBA on it. I figured, 'I've been craving sushi the whole drive over here and this must be a sign! Let's go get sushi!' I went against my better judgment and immediately walked over to have dinner with my family. Ahhhh, I definitely have regrets about that now.... Mannnnn, marketing and convenience just gets ya. -_-

Don't get me wrong; the food wasn't terrible and the ambiance had cool vibes.. I just can't justify spending that much money on 2 oz. of food. I didn't realize it was tapas style but once I found out, I just went with it and though we could order a bunch of stuff and simply share.. 

We ordered a couple of sushi rolls, one order of sea bass, a scallop appetizer, and steak. Our favorite was the sea bass-super fresh and amazzzzzing taste (but we all had one piece each because there were maybe 5 pieces?-in all honesty, that wouldn't fill me up if that was for one person). Everything else was okay but I think we would have been a lot happier, richer and fuller if we had just gotten burgers. 

I would recommend this place as a romantic date for an anniversary or birthday-for intimate occasions, not anything dealing with a group(3 or more lol)."	2	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
"This is my favorite place in Las Vegas for breakfast, especially if you are staying in The Venetian or Palazzo. 

Their menu is full of the typical breakfast meals, like steak and eggs, pancakes, French toast, and different types of scrambles. I really like their mocha lattes and beignets :) Anyway, the customer service is always great-the staff is friendly, quick and welcoming. Every time I've been here, I have left with a full and happy tummy!"	4	Grand Lux Cafe	4
"I love Max's! 

I have been to many locations and I was happy to find one in Las Vegas :) 

The customer service is really friendly and efficient plus I just love Filipino hospitality. They are super welcoming and you can't find that everywhere nowadays.. 

The food is always on point-my family and I ordered a few bigger plates so everyone could share: -Fried Chicken -Sinigang -Noodles 

We were super full and happy after our meal!"	5	Max's Restaurant	3
"Wow, I looooove TAO!

My boyfriend, sister and I got into TAO with the help of a promoter, Jonathan, and the girls received free drinks from 10:30-11:30pm so we arrived early of course :P The ambiance is reminiscent of ""Asian"" cultures I guess, with a language similar to Cantonese\/Mandarin around the walls and large bowls filled with blossoms (and naked girls dancing LOL). 

The dance floor is small but I think it's still a really fun layout. The DJ played hip hop (from 2005-now) and I really enjoyed it. It was so nice to be able to dance to songs that we grew up with. It definitely felt like a throwback night and we loved it! 

We will definitely be back when we come back to LV!"	5	Tao Nightclub	3
The service.  5 STARS.  I've always been a fan of Yardhouse but this location is now my favorite.  Bartenders to the manager (I didn't get his name but he gave the scoop on the Masters golf championship ... got me watching golf!).... everyone was were so friendly. Anways, the layout is contemporary, great view out door seating, great food (I had the "Poke Stack"), and excellent customer service.	5	Yard House	4
The lobster tacos are amazingly my! Brussel sprouts are a must. Especiale Margarita is the best ever!	5	Mesa Grill	4
3am sandwich run after playing Craps for hours, perfect! Reuben, mac and cheese -- great options!	4	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
So we just had a three course lunch for $20 a person, it was really a lot better than we thought! We sat at the bar and Tracy was a doll, she made us the green tea Margaritas and the cucumber cocktail perfectly, one of the best cocktails we have had since we got here. The siu mais are worth ordering and since the three course lunch deal is a great value just order up the cocktails. The friendly service made the experience that much better. If you want a great deal for lunch and be full, go here.	5	Ku Noodle by José Andrés	4
"We pretty much tried all the recommended dishes that the previous Yelp'ers listed.

My favorite is the fresh tofu, cause it just melts in your mouth.
Another nice dish is the kobe beef tendon.  We had to order it again just to savor the favor again.

It took a good 2+ hours for our whole dining experience but it was worth it to me\/us.

3 of us, total bill with tip....~$240.  Cheap by some ppl's standards, expensive by others.  It's all relative."	5	Raku	4.5
"We ate here on Sunday night around 2am.  Perfect timing, as they are open til 3am.
We partied at XS @ Encore and walked back towards the Venetian just to have some chinese grub, instead of taking the taxi to chinatown back\/forth for the same amount of dough.

Had the porridge dish as well as the fried chicken wings & also the szechwan beef noodle soup and singapore fried noodle.   Sounds like alot of food for the 3 of us, but it was actually pretty good to cure the buzz and the quality wasn't bad for casino chinese food.

Only gripe was, the porridge was lukewarm and they promptly took it back and heated it up nicely for us.

Worth a shot if you just want some quick chinese food and are near the Venetian."	4	Noodle Asia	3.5
This is a gorgeous place in the Encore hotel, and it does the Japanese fusion thing with absolutely the best fish, and that makes all the difference.  You'll drop some coin here, but it will be worth it.  This passes Nobu as my favorite in Vegas for sushi.	4	Mizumi	4
This is a place to fall in love with modern Spanish tapas.  It it's your first time, ask the waiter to suggest some of the signature dishes.  The veal cheeks, (I know, doesn't sound exactly good) are amazing.  Paella also.  Pricey, but worth it.	4	Jaleo	3.5
"Had not eaten at a Denny's in years and sadly I think it will be years before I eat at one again.  We choose to dine here because there was outdoor seating with a parade happening and we thought it would be fun to eat breakfast and watch all of the action. Firstly,the restaurant had an awful sewer smell. We received our breakfast and everything on my plate tasted like frankenfood. The scrambled eggs did not taste like eggs. The toast was stale and the hashbrowns were awful. It was the worst breakfast I think I have ever had because the ingredients did not even taste real.
My boyfriends breakfast was better than mine, but still nothing to write home about.
The best part of the morning was being able to have a front row seat to watch the parade, the 2 for 1 mimosas our server recommended to us and our server. She was attentive and extremly genuine. 1 Star Restaurant   5 Star Server"	1	Denny's	3
My boyfriend and I choose the Burger Bar to dine before attending the Michael Jackson One production!  I ordered the Kobe Burger.  I would not say it melted in my mouth as the decription said on the menu, but overall it was a good burger. The cocktails were great and the service was good!	4	Burger Bar	4
We came here for dinner last night, but my hubby and I were disappointed.  I knew that this place would be loud, and it was.  It was fun seeing people going on stage doing Karaoke and dancing, but the food was less to be desired.  There wasn't a huge selection on the menu, and many of the "Mexican" dishes did not include rice & beans.  Even the chips and salsa were extra! (and the chips came served in a bag)  The server seemed to push their tall glasses of margaritas, but we could not drink that much, so we paid for a smaller margarita.  The salsa was delicious, but my cheese enchiladas were less to be desired.  I did not like their red sauce.  There was a nice lady walking around making balloon hats for everyone.   All 4 of us in our group had her make us one, and we tipped her for making them.  We wore the hats while we were in the restaurant.   When we put our bank cards in the holder for our bills to be split, the server walked by very fast & grabbed it, before we could tell him we want the bill split.  Luckily, he figured it out and split the bill for us.   I don't plan to return here.  I prefer Margaritaville or Cabo Wabo's food.	3	Senor Frog's	2.5
We came here for my sister's wedding anniversary.  We got there earlier than our reservation time as we were hungry, and we were seated promptly.  We had a nice booth on the 2nd floor in the back.  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  The food we ordered included lettuce wraps, dan dan noodles (not on the menu), broccoli beef, kung pao chicken, and Mongolian beef.  My hubby also had a cup of hot & sour soup,  We all loved our food!  An employee working on a new dish they created brought us a plate of the food, and asked us if we wanted to try it, which we did.  (it was a salad with peanuts in it, but I don't recall the name).  We each ordered cocktails, and those were delicious as well.  I hope to return here again some day when visiting Vegas.	5	P.F. Chang's	3.5
We decided to eat breakfast here two days ago, since we were staying at the hotel.  I've been wanting buttermilk pancakes since seeing a picture of them on a menu in our room.  We had to wait in a long line for about 20 minutes before we were seated.  We had a party of 4 and all of us enjoyed our meals.  Our server was very pleasant and nice.  Besides a long wait, the other thing that disappointed us was the price....$100 for 4 of us!!  Ouch!   I know everything in Vegas is expensive, but Wow!  I only had pancakes, no side of bacon.  Hubby had the 2 egg breakfast with a kids size order of pancakes, and the other 2 in our party also had eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  2 of us had ordered coffee, so we had a carafe of coffee on our table.  My husband really liked the little jar of strawberry jam that was on our table.  We had pastries and coffee\/juice the next day at a different place...much cheaper.   I may return here again some day, but will remember that this place is pricey.	4	Pantry - 24 Hour Kitchen	3.5
"So when I heard Chinese Mexican fusion I expected something different than what it was. However, I wasn't disappointed when I saw the menu. It's broken up into Mexican style dishes and Chinese style dishes. Our server said it was similar to a ""tapas"" place with small plates that were meant to be shared, or to order two plates per person for a full meal. I ordered the Mexican asparagus and the Chinese Dancing Eggplant. The asparagus was amazing and I devoured all of it. Honestly would have been okay with just that because it was a pretty decent portion. The eggplant wasn't really what I expected. It's covered in a soy sauce glaze and these fish flakes (I forget the actual name, but they smell and taste really fishy). The eggplant was not the texture I expected. Was hoping for something I would have to chew rather than something that just slid down my throat. The taste was okay but I couldn't do the slimy-ish texture. We had them bring chips and salsa for the table and both were really good. I ordered the classic margarita and was not disappointed. If I ever make it back I really want to try the margarita flight, as a friend did and said it was amazing. Our server was great, answered all of our questions and made some great recommendations around the table that were raved about. He had no trouble dealing with the 14 rambunctious girls there for a bachelorette party and all of our food came out fairly quickly!

My gripe with this place is that even though it seems like there are a lot of choices, I had a tough time finding something to order other than my asparagus (which I was really excited about). I wish I would have ordered the tacos because they looked really good. A friend had the dan dan and said it was pretty spicy, but lost ordered off the Mexican portion of the menu."	4	China Poblano	3.5
We had a group of 14 girls come to Jaleo on a Friday night for a bachelorette party. Our server warned us that the plates were small but meant to be shared, which to me was a little confusing, but we went with it. I split an order of the garlic shrimp and the green beans with goat cheese with a friend and can honestly say I needed something more. If I wasn't splitting I would have been totally satisfied but he said they were meant to be shared so I did. I didn't have a drink but a few ordered the Bramble (lavender something?) and said it was really good. One person ordered the chicken fritters and they came out served in a shoe... Weird. Our server did mess up one order and apologized because he thought she pointed to something else, and left the wrong dish for us to enjoy on the house. Everyone loved their dishes but we all agreed that we wished they were bigger. They also have a separate gluten free menu, which worked out nice for a few of our girls.	4	Jaleo	3.5
"We were super excited to go to Buddy's and were definitely not disappointed! Portion sizes were great and everything was presented beautifully. Our server, Georgio, claimed to be Buddy's godson and produced a picture of Buddy holding him as a baby, but I'm a natural born skeptic and wonder if it's true :) Nonetheless, Georgio was very attentive and knowledgable about the entire menu. He even told my friend that what she was planning to order was too boring and she would probably prefer something else! He made a recommendation and she ended up loving it! My dish was nothing short of fantastic and next time I'm in Vegas will definitely be going back! The bread before dinner was served warm with traditional oil and tasted soooooo good. 

My only suggestion is definitely talk to them ahead of time about how the checks are going to work. We felt bad making him split it a couple ways because it took a while in the system."	5	Buddy V's Ristorante	4
"5 Stars for the scrambled eggs. Buttery and fresh. 
5 Stars for the fire water pit in the bar. Good tunes!

No!! Nay!! Love their fresh cucumber slices on the side bar. Perfect offset to the best of the spices! Servings are huge? More than enough to share always. Thanks Robertos!"	5	Roberto's Taco Shop	3
"Overpriced (of course) and a small ""stadium cup"" drink doesn't come with a lid (soda does come with a kid though).  $9 20 oz frozen daquiri, $3 for bottled water, $3 large soda, and $5 nachos (your typical cheap round yellow corn tortilla chips and canned liquid cheese).  

The cashier wasn't friendly but was thorough at his job (tipping out excess ice from the soda cup when requested.  No line at noon time on a holiday Monday.

We did then proceed to use their seating area for the Atlantis fountain\/statue show, so that gives them some bonus star points.

In one word: Convenient."	3	Fat Tuesday	4.5
"Ordered the mint chocolate chip shake as a snack.  The cashier was confused regarding how to use the ""charge to any MGM property room"" machine, but she figured it out.  The second cashier\/employee next to her was very friendly, and I had a nice, short conversation with him while waiting for her to sort things out.

My mint chocolate chip shake had a very strong, pleasant vanilla extract-like flavor.  The mint was not super strong, but was a nice aftertaste.

Not a fan of the communal seating, but it wasn't crowded so I could be by myself.  There was construction on the front half of the dining area, where one of the employees said they were going to install a bar.  I found it mildly entertaining that there was a Pizza Hut box prominently situated against the window both days I walked by.

I'd go back to try their food.  Good job, Bobby Flay."	4	Bobby's Burger Palace	4
"Breakfast was here as their Cafe is closed and there was a 25 minute wait at the Pub (which looked half empty, but maybe the lounge\/bar section I was looking at was closed).

It was a solid, cheap breakfast (especially compared to some of the sky-high prices at places like Caesar's cafe).  I'm disappointed they don't give credit towards the mLife card though.

The vinyl seats of the food court chairs are cracked and look really bad."	3	McDonald's	3
"I went here after watching a series of nighttime fountain shows outside, and not wanting to worry about going somewhere about to close at 10pm.

Service was definitely 5 stars.  William was personable and extremely professional.  He definitely upholds the swanky Bellagio name.

I ordered the Tuscan chicken sandwich, which is wildly overpriced for what you get.  You get pieces\/medallions of chicken (some cooked perfectly, some a little dry), not an entire chicken breast.  The ciabatta was fine, the pesto was tasty, and there was a massive amount of greens on the sandwich.

The French fries were extremely tasty, and the serving size was very generous.  They seems to be bartered, and were served piping hot.  These were actually the freshest (hottest) fries\/potatoes I had this entire trip, including fries at Michael Mina Pub and Bouchon, and the hash browns at Tom's Urban.  When I asked for extra ketchup I was provided with more than enough.  The fries truly made the meal.

The cafe borders the conservatory, but it was all very dimly lit that late in the evening.  It was quite calm, unlike the usual ""crowded with tourists"" energy of Bellagio, which made it relaxing.  The carpeted and fabric-covered atmosphere was a little bit ""fancy cafeteria"" like  (fancy 90's Luby's).

Eating the entire huge plate of French fries had me take half the sandwich as leftovers for the drive home (Signature at MGM had a fridge, and I had a cooler).  William boxed it up very nicely, provided me with a set of plastic utensils, and packaged it in a nice plastic Bellagio-logo bag.

Service and the French fries bring the cafe to a 3.5, but I'm going to round down due to the utter disappointment of the expensive chicken sandwich."	3	Cafe Bellagio	3.5
"We had originally scopes this place out before our show, as we had free passes due to a package deal.  The line was monstrous!  The line was much shorter when the Jersey Boys show let out.  However, there was a server monopolizing one of the cashier's time (trying to cash out his tips or something?) and the free cashier was a trainee who didn't know how to ring things up.  Things eventually got sorted out.

The interior is absolutely gorgeous.  The faux French village vibe (think Disney's Beauty and the Beast) was really fun to see.

I mostly indulged in crab legs the entire time.  The crab was sweet, salty, pre-cracked, and perfectly cooked.  The creme brûlée and creme caramel flan were excellent.  The bread pudding was underwhelming, as was the beef (prime rib I think, cannot remember what it was exactly).  The andouille sausage was not a winner for me, as it was super spicy.  The potatoes au gratin (scalloped potatoes) were undercooked, perhaps from being sliced too thick.  The mashed potatoes were great though.  The salmon was also quite tasty.

Beverage service was lacking, and my water glass went dry several times."	4	Le Village Buffet	3
"We were seated at the table closest to the casino, so the stench of cigarette smoke kept wafting in.  At least one guy was doing what I assume was ""vaping"" at their bar, as I don't think they're allowed to smoke in the restaurant proper, though I could be wrong.

The very decently sized (I'd call it a ""large"") Pepperoni Pizza was extremely oily and slightly too wet underneath, but was decent tasting.  The Meatballs were small and ridiculously overpriced for only getting three tiny ones and a few tiny plain crostini pieces that desperately needed a drizzle of olive oil.  Tiny portions at high prices were also seen with the admittedly yummy garlic cheese bread that was basically four half slices of an Italian loaf.  It did have a lot of cheese on it, and was great when dipped in marinara.

Refills were provided when needed.  My mint chip shake was garnished with mint chocolate cookies (looked like thin mints) and was very tasty.

Service was pretty shaky.  The server forgot my shake, and then my shake did not arrive in its to-go container.  I also had to ask for our box of leftovers, which was apparently sitting in their kitchen.  The manager did bring them out and apologized.

I probably won't be back."	3	Five50 Pizza Bar	4
"No real wait at the front for a somewhat late lunch (unlike the 20+ minute wait quoted for breakfast at Monte Carlo's Pub which was half empty\/closed off).

Since I had only consumed a protein shake and was starving, and was planning on a late after-show dinner, I decided to get something that would ""stick"" with me: Pasta!  The chicken carbonara mac and cheese had perfectly al dente penne pasta along with a fantastic cream sauce, just enough cheese, and large pieces of crispy bacon and moist chicken breast pieces.  It was an excellent meal.

Their soup is only sold by the bowl, not by the cup, which was disappointing.  Also disappointing to a family member was their lack of Eggs Benedict on the abbreviated all-day breakfast section.  But the do give out condiments in tiny little glass bottles and jars!

Our waiter did keep vanishing for long periods of time, so it was very difficult to order additional items or get refills.  Hence only 4 stars.

The prices made me go a little wide-eyed, but I wasn't paying, so I didn't really consider it."	4	Cafe Americano	3.5
"Minus one star immediately for the inflated pricing.  $9.25 for a bowl of Cheerios or Corn Flakes!  That's just ridiculous, as there's absolutely no way they can claim the price inflation is due to the quality of ingredients, chef's skill, or the like.

I liked the beautiful floor to ceiling windows, which give a lovely view of...the parking structure and driveway.  I've heard others refer to it as airport like, and it does indeed have a ""fancy terminal"" vibe.  Nonetheless, the teal and river rock-accented decor is clean and classy, though the seats are showing wear and tear and need to be reupholstered (this seems to be a common problem).

Thankfully, the food was fantastic.  My brioche French toast was light, fluffy, chewy, and perfectly cooked.  My ($6!) side of turkey bacon was requested crispy and came out exactly that; a salty, crunchy compliment to my sweet entree.  Other family members enjoyed their food as well, including a tasty pecan waffle and fried chicken that I snuck a bite of.

Service was pretty good as well, and the food came out in a timely manner.  If I had a dining credit I'd come back, but if not, I might need to try Bellagio's cafe or a breakfast place at New York New York.  Definitely a safe option for breakfast or brunch though."	4	ARIA Café	2.5

"Vegas is full of overpriced restaurants with mediocre food. We found this place wandering through the MGM Grand on the way to a comedy show. Didn't have time to order mains but had drinks and appetizers before our show. Ordered off the specialty drink menu, and man they were good. I got a raspberry cocktail that was delish and hubs had a margarita that was solid. Warm pretzel appetizer was so good. It was served with pretzel nuggets and a creamy white cheese with mustard.

But here's the real deal. The nachos. Hubs & I are obsessed with the big, messy pile variety of nachos and not big lovers of the neatly arranged plate of a dozen moderately topped round tortilla chips. The big pile at TAP is as good as it gets. We got ours with chili, and that chili is so good! Big chunks of beef that just fell apart with the fork, perfectly seasoned. They are fully loaded with sour cream, guac, pickled jalapeños, and basically all the stuff you expect on a big pile.

And yep. It's a sports bar. Woohoo! Screens visible from every angle. We'll go back just for football next time we're in Vegas. I'm watching football now and wishing I had a pile of those nachos to go with my game.

Loss of a star for slow service. It wasn't that busy when we were there, and our server just didn't seem with it. She was pleasant just not all there."	4	TAP Sports Bar	3.5
Chicken in the shoe is the best dish there.  Hands down.  No I don't like feet.	4	Jaleo	3.5
"great steaks. 

-prime rib was well cooked on the outside, nice and pink in the center.
-bone-in ny strip was excellent and the meat was the star, not the seasoning. 
-short ribs are a great option as well. not as large a serving as the other two, but very tender and tasty.

great sides:

-potatoes were amazing.
-baby carrots were good, not great.
-wild mushrooms are definitely a must order
-their cream-style corn is seasonal so order if its on the menu

they started out with an amuse bouche  of smoked salmon and creme fraiche on this crispy potato slice. also amazing and a great way to start dinner."	4	Neros	3.5
Broadway Burger was one the high spots of the places we ate at in Vegas.  The famed buffets we tried were total busts so we decided to try the various eateries in New York-New York.  Of the three we tried, Broadway Burger was the best compared to other burger places.  The choices are many and unique, the flavor of the meat is super, the service is great, and so are the prices compared to others we experienced in Vegas.	5	Broadway Burger Bar & Grill	3.5
Cool neighborhood bar. Lots of big screen tvs and cheap food and drink specials during games. The highlight is definitely the icey cold draft beers...so cold and delicious!! Also the service was great...thank you Rachael!	5	T-Bird Lounge & Restaurant	3.5
"The food was delivered over an hour and half after I placed the order. I called the restaurant twice and explained my kids needed to go to bed, only an apology was offered. The restaurant blamed the driver and suggested the food was just waiting to be picked up. Hmmm doesn't sound fresh after an hour and a half. The fee and tip had already been added to my order. I will not order from this restaurant again. I order at 630pm pizza arrive at 753pm. 

In all fairness the pizza was flavorful and a nice change from other local establishments. Salad was warm, garlic knots were burnt, pizza was good."	2	Pizza Company	4
This is the best place for Chicago style pizza! Not only is it yummy, they have an awesome team who cares about service. It makes me miss home in the Midwest even more. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!	5	Windy City Beefs N Pizza	4
"They have a drinks menu but if you want to order drinks you can ""only"" sit at the bar? Ridiculous policy.

Update: I received a call from the General Manager and she informed me she will discuss allowing guests to have drinks on their patio with management. I upgraded 1 star to 3 stars due to effort."	3	Terrace Pointe Cafe	4
Dont even think twice. We visit this place on every vegas trip. Abadaba - pork taco is food from heaven and i dont even like tacos.	5	Tacos El Gordo	4
"This is a great Budget hotel. I booked two different rooms for my me and some friends so I was able to check out two types of rooms: King bed only and the two twin bed rooms. The King bed room was really spacious and quite clean. Never encountered anything that would gross me out or make think this is some run down hotel. The Double twin bed room however was a little smaller than the king. Also the shower head in that one was pretty low compared to the one in the King Room. 

I think the palace station hotel is great for anyone on a budget or for those looking for a place to crash for a few hours at night. If you're looking for a nice hotel with all the bells and whistles, or if you're uptight about budget hotels then go ahead and pay at least triple for a hotel on the strip. Or you can upgrade to their tower rooms which I hear are nicer. 

I'll be coming back next time."	4	Palace Station Hotel & Casino	2.5
WARNING*** This business is closed. Me and my wife were going to eat dinner when we realized the place has been seized by the city.	1	Fresh Kabob	4
Ask for Eric the bartender. He is the most amazing bartender I have ever encountered in my travels around the globe. Despite being in a major casino on the strip, and the drinks being complicated (ask for the smoked whiskey cola) the tab was only 49.00 for 6 drinks. WILL BE BACK!!	5	Rx Boiler Room	4
The food here is amazing! Just the right amount of spices with lots of flavor. I would recommend Big Jerk to everyone!	5	Big Jerk	4.5
Great food in large portions. I got a meat calzone and I can easily say that it is the best I've ever eaten. I would easily eat here again.	5	Palermo's Pizza	3
This had been our favorite breakfast place on two previous trips to Las Vegas. I'm only giving it 3-stars today because my breakfast (prime rib Benny) was awful. The croissant on the bottom was just a pile of mush, the prime rib was just little pieces of meat, and the hollandaise sauce had NO flavor (my husband, who loved his biscuits and gravy, agreed with me on the no flavor).  Service was excellent, but I'm really disappointed with my breakfast.	3	Egg & I	4.5
My favorite sushi spot on the north side of Vegas!!! Service is great and quality is awesome!!! Can't go wrong with AYCE when the choices are so BOMB!!!	5	Sushi Bomb	4
Absolutely the best view of the bellagio fountains and the food and service are amazing. Dont skip the green beans.	5	Olives	4
We love Italy and good Italian food - this place feels like Italy and the food is great! The moscato grappa was a perfect end to our meal: smooth, sweet and the flavor if Italy.	5	Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar	4
Another great Yelp find. What did we do before Yelp? We suffered through boring, run of the mill restaurants. This little gem, however, is tucked away just off the strip. Great food and good beer selection. My first pasty and I loved it!  I had the Mexican. My husband, who loves pasties, had the meat and cheese. Great!	5	Cornish Pasty	4.5
I had a friend order me the doubled grilled chicken salad through the drive through yesterday but with shrimp , $2.00 extra for shrimp, total cost $9.64. She brought it to me and the size of it ridiculously small . The insides of the shell there were barely any salad inside . So drive back , and told them , I just wanted my money back on my debt card. The manager , Cynthia, gave us $2.00 cash abs said the rest would go back on Debt card. We drive away , and instead of refunding , she charged another $9.62 to the credit card again , Back to the drive through again , only to be told by Cynthia again, that she refunded it . I tried to explain and showed her our phone where the two transactions were charged at the different times . She said the refund will show tomorrow a day if not call the corporate office tomorrow . Called corporate when got home, no one has called as of now and only 1 refund had been back in the credit card . Trying to call corporate office again now . Terrible customer service and food service all around	1	El Pollo Loco	3
I suggested this for a date .. We sat at the bar and service was terrible . Ordered one drink and didn't get acknowledge until our glasses were empty . Went to use the ladies room ( co'ed) I was shocked ! No toilet paper, I had to use paper towels that were all over the bathroom floor and over flowing onto the floor .NO running water . The soap dispenser was turned upside down on the wall . I asked for the manager who was the bartender too. She said she had just heard about and was trying to fix it . I also noticed about 50-60 dirty glasses sitting on the back of the bar ...	2	Double Helix Wine & Whiskey Lounge	4
Horrible experience with a employee named oscar,Me and my boyfriend go here in this location a lot,most of the time we eat inside but sometimes we do drive thru,I saw this particular employee counting change with his gloves and he never change his glove after counting the change while handling food..He was literally putting the fries in small little tray then press it with his dirty gloves,I'm so disgusted so I confronted him told him he is not gonna touch my food and he said he change his gloves all the time.But he just change his glove after I confronted him.i mapping that the manager will take action regarding this issue.we want our food to be clean.	1	In-N-Out Burger	4
"You will have a much better time throwing a couple hundred of your hard earned dollars into a trash bucket on the front porch, dousing it in lighter fluid, and lighting it on fire than eating here! The net result is the same and it will be warmer!

First of all, they ask for your CREDIT CARD to place a reservation for four people. I asked why and they said they would charge me if I didn't show up. Okay. So have a fake credit card handy when you call. In my case I ""messed up"" some numbers and they never said anything about it. 

We get there and the place is fricken freezing and empty. Glad they would have charged me for ditching a table when I would have been preventing absolutely no one from using it had we not shown. 

The waitress was frigid. I don't know if it was the extreme cold (it was seriously unbearable in there), her first day, or just her marching orders (be as stern and unapproachable as possible- and above all: no fun), or perhaps she was just having a bad day... But she was not in the mood for any bullshit. You will order. You will eat. You will die. Not necessarily in that order. 

Food was okay at best, cold when it came out (I wonder why??). Plus, the food is outrageously expensive and you get very little of it. Any review you read about ""my meat was cooked to perfection."" Get over it, I cook my steaks to perfection on a $99 grill every time at home too so we're not exactly curing cancer over here. 

A lot of people confuse pretentiousness with good food, and I found the whole atmosphere to be misleading. You're at planet hollywood, on the strip in Vegas, and here you have a restaurant with a silly name taking itself way too seriously."	1	Strip House Steak House	4
This is the definitive Vegas, off-strip joint! Plexi-glass nclosed smoking bar in front and funky eats in back. We had the Stromboli's and oh man were they great!!	4	Four Kegs Sports Bar	4
The rumor is that the Pinks in Vegas is not as good as the original one in LA. I've only had the Pinks in LA once so I can't really compare. I liked my double hotdog with chili and jalepenos. I forgot the name of it, but I think it was something like the Vegas Strip.	3	Pink's Hot Dogs	3
"Excellent food, excellent variety, excellent prices!  Our group of four enjoyed the experience of trying all sorts of new foods and combinations with prices reasonable enough to get adventurous.  The maguro carpaccio and koko beef (I think that's the name) are DO NOT MISS items, but skip the bleu cheese potato salad, very bland.
Service wasn't fast, but was attentive and accommodating.  We will be going back!"	4	Kyara Japanese Tapas	4
"Everyone must try this place at least once.  It was one of the most unique, tasty, and interesting dinners we have had. 
Believe the other reviewers; the samosa appetizer is PHENOMENAL! I could have made a meal of them.  We were a party of 4, so asked to dine family style-waiter agreed that was a good idea. Our 4 entrees could have fed 8! Best was the Traditional Nayama and Ugali. A wonderfully seasoned 'chicken stew' traditional in Kenya. Excellent balance of spice and sweet with a wonderful mix of flavors. Two dishes came with spinach - one of our group called the spinach 'green crack.' I found it too salty however, and I love spinach. Taste of Nairobi is also a must order; no leftovers for that dish. Other 2 dishes were surprisingly unique in flavor - pork chop and (spicy) grilled shrimp. Everything had an excellent and unique sweet\/spicy flavor a la Kenyan spices. Available wines paired well with the dishes. 
Nothing seemed overpriced. The owner\/chef even visited our table, perhaps because we were there until 10:30 (they closed at 9). We will be going back to this hidden gem! We were there on a Thursday and the place was empty, what is wrong with you people!"	4	Wine 5 Cafe	4.5
Interesting menu for a tapas restaurant.  I have been twice now, and enjoyed it both times.  Some excellent items, such as short rib, crimini caps, salmon skewers, and aloha tips, but I would avoid the Monte Christo.  Undecided on the chicken and waffles.  The place is super casual, echoes of a diner.  But that fits with the neighborhood.  The price does not really fit with the neighborhood.  Plates average $6 to $10 each, with some higher, which was more than we expected, especially with less expensive tapas restaurants in nicer parts of town.  Staff is very nice, even changing the background music when we commented on the annoying rap music playing.  Will likely go back, if out of town friends come for a visit.	4	Nosh & Swig	4
I think this is my favorite new spot. Wonderful food and staff. Update: Never posted this. On our way back, hoping it's still as good!! I'm sure it is!	5	Frijoles & Frescas Grilled Tacos	4
"Great for vegans\/vegetarians!!! This is my first time in Las Vegas as a vegetarian and I was unsure about the options I would have for meals...boy, was I glad my boyfriend found this place! This meal zapped away our hangovers and got our bodies up and running again. Delicious food!!! Spicy chicken is SPICY! but it was so good I couldn't stop eating it. Also, their fruit slushes are fantastic!! 
If you are vegan\/vegetarian don't miss out on eating here during your Vegas stay....we will definitely be coming back!"	5	Veggie Delight	4
"My wife's friend raved about this place, so I had to check it out during my most recent business trip to Vegas. Having lived in Japan, I set the bar for Japanese cuisine pretty high. Raku met and surpassed all of my expectations.

The restaurant is extremely small - book reservations well in advance or you have no shot getting in as a walk-in. The Japanese staff was very courteous and seated me at the sushi bar. The clientele was colorful to say the least - I was sandwiched between a Raku fanatic from the east coast and an Asian girl in a formal white dress who was simply off the hook.

After you're seated, the waitress will bring over a chalkboard with the specials of the day. They're all fresh and worth the money. Fresh fish and meat dishes for the most part.

Tofu is the specialty of the house, and Raku's adedashi tofu is without equal. It comes in a spicy broth with fresh mushrooms, seaweed and salmon eggs on top.

As side dishes I had the crispy asparagus okaki, kurobuta pork cheek, sauteed butter scallop and the kobe beef skirt steak with crispy garlic. They were all fantastic, and I wrapped up the meal with the green tea creme brulee, which was to die for.

Watching the chefs work is one of the charms of Raku. Right before your eyes, they do everything from slicing fresh sashimi to ladeling out bowls of piping hot oden. What's more you can tell they're totally passionate about the cuisine.

Raku is a real Vegas gem, and it's a good cab ride away from the strip. It's worth it."	5	Raku	4.5
"Sushi Samba is a great sushi place if you like Americanized, fusion-sushi. Conveniently located in the Palazzo shops, its great for a quick bite if you're staying at the Wynn or Venetian and don't want to walk too far.

The prices are reasonable and the quality of the food is very good. I was particularly impressed with the huge portion of grilled yellowtail cheek I got for what I paid.

The sauces that accompany their sushi rolls are quite interesting - mustard, ponzu and soy-based. 

My one complaint, and it's a major one, is that I had to order sake THREE TIMES before I actually got a glass. My first and second choices were sold out, and it took the waitress 15 minutes between orders just to tell me this. Finally, when I picked a sake they hadn't run out of, there was not enough left in the bottle to constitute a full serving. I wasn't charged for it, but it was too little, too late. What I ended up drinking was far from what I was in the mood for.

If you sell sake by the glass, running out during the peak dinner hour in Vegas is unacceptable."	3	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
"Picasso is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Why blow $400 gambling and be left with nothing, when you can experience Chef Julian Serrano's cuisine instead?

The ambiance is second to none in Vegas. Requesting a window seat is an absolute must - it gives you an intimate, private view of the Bellagio fountains. Real Picasso artwork, worth millions, watches you from the walls as you eat. Especially notable is the Picasso behind the bar - it's one of the most unique in Vegas.

For dinner, you choose between either the 4-course Degustation menu ($123) or 3-course Prix Fixe menu ($119). Wine pairings are offered for an additional $63 or $55, respectively. 

My advice to you regarding the wine pairings is this - SPEND THE MONEY. Not only will a master sommelier entertain you with the history of each wine before pouring you a glass, but you'll also get to taste wines with extremely limited production runs (ex. only 100 bottles made each year).

The flavor of the wine, when paired with the food simply needs to be experienced to be believed. The best illustration of this was the sauteed ""A"" streak of foie gras. The peaches in the dish, paired with the muscat grape and cinnamon flavors in the wine, made it the best dish I have ever eaten in my life.

Must-haves include the foie gras, deer, quail salad and the Colorado lamb. While the dishes are not huge, you will not leave Picasso hungry. All-you-can eat bread, complimentary amuse bouche h'oeuvres and a complimentary tower with bite size desserts will be served.

Highly recommended - 5 stars."	5	Picasso	4.5
I really enjoyed my meal at Mizumi. While the food was decadent, the service was amazing (props to Stacey for being my silver lining -- but more on that later), what absolutely topped my experience was learning that restaurants (in Vegas no less) have dress codes which necessitate the staff to keep loaner pants on hand. Arriving in bright white shorts, I learned just how myopic my view of the world was. I was greeted with two options -- go back to the hotel and change or wear loaner pants. Needless to say, I chose the latter. Can I just say that I rocked those loaner pants! Never mind the fact that they a) didn't zip up, b) didn't button and c) made me glad I was wearing a long blue polo. I think in hindsight is was actually recognition by the staff, based on my body dimensions, on just how much I was about to consume. Our waitress (with 11 years of experience at the restaurant, mind you) said I was merely her second example of someone wearing loaner pants. I took this to mean I was only the second person naive enough to think that dress codes didn't exist at a hotel restaurant in Las Vegas. Will I be back? Heck ya. Next time I'll ask for the accompanying blazer.	5	Mizumi	4
So delish! Googled and went on our way out of town. I had the butterbeer latte, mom had the pumpkin spice latte, brother had peanut butter mocha. My dad got a capp. The lattes were fantastic. Flavorful but not too sweet. The place has a great feel to it too. Cute pop culture themed art work ala keith harring.  Will definitely stop in again next time we're in town	5	Grouchy John's Coffee	4.5
This has gotten to be the worst Food I've ever ordered from anywhere. There is no flavor whatsoever adding salt just made it worse. Really got my hopes up. being 7 months pregnant and craving Chinese food. Very disappointing. On the upside delivery was very fast. That's the only good thing I can say.	1	China Kitchen LV	4
I love this place for the sole fact that they do their boneless wings with grilled chicken.  I just ordered UberEats from there and we ordered 2 snack size wings and some buffalo chips.  On the app it gives you the option to pick multiple flavors for the snack size.  Where if you're at the restaurant it's just 1 sauce. They still fulfilled both flavors so that was awesome!  I never received the buffalo chips so that was a bummer considering I had paid for them and I really wanted to try their spicy ranch.  Hopefully my next experience with that restaurant is better \/:	4	WingNutz	3.5
Honestly I walked into The Juice Standard and my day was made. The employees were so helpful and kind. A girl named Mia helped me decide which juice I should get and she steered me in the right direction. Her kind voice and sweet personality made me blush. Latifa also helped me out a lot. Her upbeat mannerisms made me smile. I'm definitely coming back here soon.	5	The Juice Standard	4.5
"I love the location because it pretty much is a stand alone restaurant with not much else around. Conveniently located for an after-biking-and-on-my-way-home breakfast. On Rainbow just south of Cactus. 

I waited to write a review because I wanted to try the chicken fried steak for myself. I love crispy, and this batter was one of the best! I chose over easy egg, potatoes and pancakes instead of the hash browns and biscuit. I like that the gravy was not too rich or heavy. The first time I came here, I had the breakfast sandwich with hash browns and it was ok but didn't rock my world - same for the coffee. From my picture, it looks like the hash browns are burnt, but they didn't taste burnt.

But what stands out to me are the people who work there. The first time, we chatted with the owner a bit who was quite personable. This second time, one of our servers was so chatty and made us laugh with his storytelling skills! 

If you're in the area, give this place a try. I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu."	4	Our Families Country Cafe	4
"This review is for breakfast solo dining on a weekday. I sit outside if the weather is nice, at a table inside if it's not, or at the counter if it's really crowded. This place is consistently welcoming and I know I will get a satisfying meal each time. Service is quick and the friendly staff is attentive with coffee and water refills. 

I usually get the same things, but looking at the other pictures, I need to branch out a bit! I get either the traditional French toast, the Plainview Diner or the Californian. The last two are egg white omelettes. If I feel like going meatless, I go for the Plainview with spinach, garlic and feta cheese. The Californian has turkey, the usual veggies of mushrooms, onions, spinach and topped with - and here's the CA part - avocados, tomatoes and jack cheese. The French toast is pretty standard. I guess that's why I like it! It's not trying to be something that it's not :) 

Love the family feel of the place and I'm so pleased to see they are busy whenever I stop in...but never too busy to give great service!"	5	The Original Sunrise Cafe	4.5
"Breakfast with a little Hawaiian flare. My two favorite dishes here (so far) are the 9th island French toast and the Vegas style avocado toast. Add extra fruit to the French toast and it really doesn't need any syrup added to it. After eating the avocado toast, I leave full, but not weighed down. 

Love the small, family owned businesses because you can feel the love and pride from the owners. They are eager to satisfy your appetite!"	4	Dirty Fork	3.5
"This was my first time at this larger location. A Tuesday night and it was crowded! Make reservations when you go. We got there around 8:20pm and their first availability was 9pm. The location is easier to see since it's close to the street. They have a nice outdoor seating area with misters. And there are benches inside and outside to accommodate guests waiting for their tables. 

When we were seated, the first thing I noticed was the noise level. It was quite loud. Hard floors, high ceilings and open layout made it a little playground for all the sound waves! But it got quieter as people trickled out. The service was nice and attentive. Food came out in a timely manner.

We had the grilled octopus and calamari as appetizers. Both prepared well, but the octopus had more flavor. I had the Crazy Alfredo which I enjoyed because it was a touch spicy. I guess I was in the mood for a little kick! It had shrimp, sausage, chicken, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes and jalapeños. Overall, a pleasant experience, but nothing that really stood out. 

They also have a private room which would be nice for groups."	4	Nora's Italian Cuisine	4
It's hard for me to resist this place conveniently located in the Bellagio near the conservatory. Although it might seem expensive to pay $17 for two items, it never bothers me because I'm always satisfied. Beautiful to look at and equally beautiful to partake. They also have crepes, gelato, pastries, sandwiches and salads if you want  something more. There are small tables near windows overlooking the pool to sit and enjoy or take your treats to go.	5	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
Ever since I saw a picture of the taiyaki, I wanted to come here. If you get this, grab a few napkins because it can get messy! It was smaller than I imagined, but it was actually just right for me. And the batter was crispier than I imagined. I was expecting it to be spongey like traditional taiyaki, but I got over it. It was a bit like a wafer at first, and then was denser in the bottom. I loved all the flavors together. And I love that this was even created. Next, I would love to see Japanese style parfaits on the menu!	4	Cafe Summer	4
Food is good but customer service was sub par.   We got no plates to eat off of, waited about 30 minutes before being asked if we were ready to order, then another 30 minutes after being served our first dish.	2	Sushi Way	4.5
"Decided to bring my mom here for an early Mother's Day dinner since she likes pizza. It's a bit more upscale than I thought. We came on a Saturday around 5pm so I thought we'd be the only ones, but there was already a large group and the tables started to fill up quickly. 

We ordered
- Grilled octopus, served on a bed of couscous 
- Ossobuco with a saffron risotto 
- Asparagus with lemon and butter sauce
- Pepperoni pizza with bell peppers and mushrooms added

My favorites were the veal shank and octopus. Both were so tender and seasoned just right for my taste. I wouldn't usually order asparagus, but my mom likes it so we ordered it. We both thought it was ok, but probably wouldn't order it again. The pizza was a bit salty for both of us and the crust was too thin...or maybe the topping was too heavy?! In any case, I prefer my pizza to be of the Unfloppy variety :) But it did force us to fold to eat it and look like we were from the east coast! 

Service and vibe were quite pleasant, food was mostly good, but the bill seemed a bit high considering we didn't have any drinks. So overall I give 3 stars using my very scientific method of taking the excellent service and 2 out of 4 dishes (5 stars), and subtracting for the 2 out of 4 so-so dishes, price value and likelihood I'd be back for dinner (2 stars), making it a strong average 3 star."	3	Prosecco Fresh Italian Kitchen	4.5
"When I first heard about this smoke free billiards place, I knew I had to pay a visit. On Decatur near Twain, parking was not an issue on a Wednesday night around 7pm. We walked in and were immediately greeted by the bartender who asked if we wanted a table and what size. Standard or 9 ft. We weren't sure, but went for the smaller table. I'm short and didn't feel like sprawling on a large table! She gave us the cue ball and told us our table number.

First thing we noticed looking at the pool floor was that it was quiet. There were about 7 tables in front with players, but they were focused. It might have been a league. Since I've never seen league play, I don't know if that's the etiquette...or maybe it just happened to be a bunch of serious players. In any case, I liked that atmosphere. Music and TVs weren't too loud either. 

The server was attentive and I liked that she checked on us a few times while we played. I will come back again since I want to become a pool shark  I'm just a guppy now, but with some practice, I hope to become an adolescent. I recommend this place if you want a clean, smoke free place to shoot pool. They also serve food, but we didn't order anything from the menu - maybe next time. The tables were $10\/hour so it's a fun, affordable way to spend a few hours."	5	Griff's	4.5
"Open, clean space. They even have small tables to the side for the kids. I'm new to this poke bowl craze, so it was nice that this place had clear and easy instructions on how to order. At each step, the man guided me - ""you get three proteins"", ""you get unlimited sides"". He made suggestions and when it came time to pick a sauce he asked what I was looking for. And I was in the mood for spicy mayo so I got the poke poku style with sesame oil, spicy mayo, spicy chili and sriracha. Next time, I think I'll try one with ponzu sauce. 

My poke bowl consisted of:

2 sides (spicy crab, edamame), 3 proteins (tuna, salmon, yellowtail), unlimited mix-ins (masago, cucumber), unlimited toppings (jalapeño, crispy onion, roasted garlic, tamago, nori, bonito, ginger, tobiko) all on a half & half mix of brown\/white rice 

The ingredients were fresh and the sides were prepared nicely. So many different textures to keep me interested :) I especially liked the crispy onion and traditional pickled ginger. My base was half and half brown rice\/white rice. Next time I will go with salad because it felt a bit heavy for me with all those toppings and fish. See, I'm already learning!"	4	Poke Poku Hawaiian Poke Bar	4.5
Visited on Wednesday and the kids liked it so much we went back on Friday. We were only visiting vegas and this is honestly such a good breakfast place I have been so many times to vegas with out kids and have never had a decent breakfast. I will definitely come back when we visit again (with or with out kids) the food was really good , I got an omlette and asked for avocado they are very generous on their portions. They were busy but the food and service was fast.our waitress Liza ( hope I got her name right) was such an awesome server! And she remembered us:) she is another reason I would come back when visiting vegas.	5	Egg & I	4.5
"I'm the type of person that likes quantity over quality while my boyfriend prefers quality over quantity. So we jump between Carnival World Buffet at the Rio and Bacchanal at Caesar's. But then we discovered The Buffet at Aria and just like that, we found our new favorite place to eat.

We went for brunch the day after Thanksgiving so there was no line, a BIG plus. It's still a new place and it's separated enough from the casino that the cigarette smoke doesn't reach you (a bigger plus for those of us who hate the constant cloud). The restaurant is beautiful and airy with attention to the tiniest detail, even the cups they serve juice in.

FOOD FOOD FOOD. There was a good selection and most of it was pretty high quality if you avoid the ""Asia"" section. They keep their supplies fresh and well stocked and I enjoyed watching a chef make pancakes as big as car tires. My boyfriend could not get over how good the breakfast items were. I personally am not a big dessert fan but had several helpings of cake and pie. Not too sweet and just the right size to allow you to try all their selections.

The waitress we had was super nice even though she was busy and she made the effort to swing around and check up on us when she had the chance so good service too.

It was a bit on the pricey side but I would say it was well worth it."	5	The Buffet at ARIA	3
I really like their food but every time I make an order for delivery they end up messing my order up. I always order a pepperoni pizza with mushrooms and they never put mushrooms on it so every time I call to complain they hand up the phone	1	New York Pizza & Pasta	4
Best buffet in town. We visit at least once every time we go. Make sure to ask waiter for the hot crab legs.	5	Spice Market Buffet	3
Worst tasting food I've ever experienced at a buffet.  Roast beef was dry, turkey was dry, chicken was moist, the crab legs were good, It was cold though. Price isn't too bad, but if you was tasty food then you may as well go to a fast food restaurant.	2	Paradise Buffet & Cafe Restaurant	2.5
"This place doesn't gove off that motel feel. The bed sheets are CLEAN, the rooms are trendy, and the entire resort is super hipster. The pool isn't heated (can't use during the few winter months), they play pop music outside that you can hear from your room. Yes, they do provide ear plugs.

Me and my party were pleasantly surprised with the decor for such a cheap rate. We didn't expect the shower floor to be made out of pebbles, or the lamps be recycled art, etc."	5	Gold Spike	4
Authentic mexican food. The meat inside of the carne asada burrito was super moist. The tacos were good, but the meat couldnt been a lil more tender. Overall, id come back	4	Roberto's Taco Shop	2.5
Good quality and cheap pizza. My favorite things about this place are the Garlic Knots and the simple fact that they sell single slices all throughout the day and not just during the average business lunch rush. I'm glad I ate here instead of some over priced pizza on the las vegas strip.	4	Frankie's Pizza	4.5
Best wonton soup, awesome yellow curry. Hands down best Thai food I've ever had, and I've traveled all over Asia. Their food is love :)	5	Thai Pepper	4
"You know it's legit when you're the only white person in the restaurant. This is officially the greatest tasting Indian food I have EVER experienced in my life! Thank you YELP for leading me here.

Only down fall is how well they're doing. This place is so packed that they are having trouble keeping their buffet filled. The naan is instantly gone once it's put out\/served."	5	Delhi Indian Cuisine	4
"Update: just reading threw some of these reviews it's insain that some people find the need to nit pick this place for every last detail! Seriously people complaining about not having a big enough onion on their burger ?? R u kidding me ! People not used to vegan cheese saying it tastes funny, complaining about it being busy ??its the 1st vegan drive thru in Vegas hellloo  it's going to be busy. Can people leave constructive critisism? ....having an opinion  is one thing but knocking a place that's promoting compassion to animals that's just asking for bad karma. Seriously let's appreciate the fact that we have a vegan drive thru in our city....if u dont like Vegeway take your wining to McDonalds! 

And fyi... The burgers are freakin bomb here! Chef Kenny is bomb, and the customer service was bomb!"	5	VegeWay	4
"Horrible customer service!! There's plenty of good taco joints in Vegas that have good food and nice service, don't waste your money at this robertos. It's a shame cuz the food at this location is not bad but I'd much rather give my money to a place where I'm not treated with attitude by the cashiers. 

The cashiers especially those in the drive thru need a major lesson in friendliness."	2	Roberto's Taco Shop	3
Decent vegeterian options, their vegetable tempura is super good and they give u a lot for your money, their hours are a lil weird, some days yelp shows their open but aren't actually open. Good customer service. I've Been in the neighborhood  and seen a lot of different types of restaurants go in and out of this shop, seems to be kinda cursed for new businesses but really hoping they do well cuz their food is good and the prices are great.  My husband loves the sushi and hes a pretty hardcore sushi critic since he's Hawaiian lol. I don't eat fish or meat so wish their was more veggie options but they have a nice selection and are pretty flexible with customizing orders to accommodate ..but im missing their veggie gyozas!!! They were amazing hoping they bring it back to the menu :)	4	Tokyo Peking Asian Restaurant	4
Awesome little vegan bakery shop! I had the walnut brownies OMG sooooo moist and chewy and the almond truffle, which was chocolate x10 sooo good! Highly reccommend,  lets support the little guys!! :)	5	Vegan Bites	4.5
Veggiehouse!! I love this place..ive been coming here for the past 2 yrs, amd the customer service is amazing! ALL of the waitresses are sweet as can be and although theres a bit of a language gap theyre amazing!!! Theyre knowledgable of the menu and always suggest new things to try that never dissapoint. This place is amazingggg and defntly one of my fav vegan places in Vegas! Good job guys keep up the great work!	4	Veggie House	4.5
Amazing fresh and original sushi here. Great on a date away from the Las Vegas strip. And recommended by a local no less!	4	Yonaka Modern Japanese	4.5
I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars, not only because the food and service were both excellent, but because I'm very excited that there is finally a decent Mexican restaurant in Summerlin. I had the fish tacos and my girlfriend had the cheese enchiladas (which inexplicably comes with chile con carne on top - she opted for the delicious but spicy tomatillo sauce instead). My tacos were flavorful and juicy, and they were grilled, not fried, which I loved. The picked onions on top were yum yum.  Complimentary chips were light and crunchy and the salsas were tasty. We each had a margarita which were made with fresh squeezed juices and a VERY healthy pour of tequila. Hopefully they keep this up! I thought the room and bar area were lovely and understated, with plenty of natural light.  Our server (Cesar) was great - we got lots of attention and copious drink refills. Overall, lunch was a big thumbs-up.....we will certainly be back to try other menu items and take advantage of the happy hour margaritas...	4	Cantina Laredo	3.5
"I've lived in Las Vegas for almost 10 years now, and Grape Street happened to be one of the first restaurants I visited off the Strip, way back when.  At that time, it was great....excellent service, food you can tell they cared about, and an eclectic wine list that was not over-priced.  In the last few years, this place has really jumped the shark.  The last few times I've given Grape Street another chance to redeem itself, both the food and service has been inconsistent and the prices have gone way up.  I can tell you, the penne ala vodka does NOT taste like it used to.

On my latest trip there, my girlfriend and I stopped in for a glass of wine and sat at the bar, which only had a few guys at the other end.  First, the pinot they poured me was cloudy tasted like it had been opened for a week or more.  Then after he poured, we could not get the bartender to acknowledge us again since he and someone who appeared to be the chef spent all their time bantering very loudly with the guys at the end of the bar.  I can't tastefully repeat what they were talking about, but it was more than enough to make my friend and I put down money for the drinks and walk out.

If you want a truly elegant and delicious wine and food experience, skip Grape Street and go to Nora's."	2	Grape Street	3.5
"I keep wanting to like this place, and keep giving it chances, but it continues to disappoint.  My savory buckwheat crepe was very good, but that's about it.  The accompanying salad of bagged greens was oily and bland, and I practically had to trip a waiter to get a refill of water on the steamy-hot patio.  There were only two in my party, and it was obvious that the bigger groups were getting our share of the attention.  I think I might be done with this place once and for all.  I thought the food was going to improve with the change of ownership and chef, but that does not seem to be the case.  On top of that, the lousy service was distracting and annoying and the food simply did not justify the high prices.

I'll be back to shop in the wine store because they have an excellent and colorful selection.  Otherwise, I will continue my frustrating hunt for a great, local restaurant in the northwest."	2	Marché Bacchus	3.5
A BBQ place that's out of pork and ribs.. Wow.. And it says a 2 meat plate comes with cornbread but I can only get it as one of my sides because they are losing their vender so they give you a small loaf of bread... Smh. Should have just gone to Rollin smoke	1	Billy's BBQ	4

FYI ... This L&L does NOT take L&L gift cards. If you are planning to use an L&L gift card, go to another L&L. Pretty irraz. Prolly won't be back to this one.	1	L & L Hawaiian BBQ	3
Great experience!  We got the Hells Kitchen tasting menu and it was fantastic. Our waiter's name was Matthew and he was just wonderful!  When you get the tasting menu, you get a souvenir menu with a photo of Gordon Ramsay.  When we told Matthew we were big fans of Hells Kitchen,  he had our menu signed be Christina Wilson - season 10 winner of Hells Kitchen.  This may be geeky, but we were thrilled.  Our 4 kids love Hells Kitchen so this was great for us.  We also took our picture with Christina.  Amazing food!  Amazing service!  Highly recommended!	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
This place is a great Japanese restaurant from the owners of Ichiza, right down the street.  This is my first time trying Kushiage and it is really good food. This place is amazing service and is very clean and the food is great too. If you enjoy Japanese food and you come to Las Vegas you should definitely come here and have a meal! It is very close to the strip too.	5	Yu-Yu	4.5
Amazing Indian cuisine with exquisite and prompt service. I come often and am never disappointed.	5	Mount Everest India's Cuisine	4.5
"A Great Culinary Experience!

I never write reviews.  I mean, ever.  But I feel that these guys deserve a review, no, they deserve praise!

The food was exquisite and the service was superb.  Imagine a small sandwich shop with four star food and service couple with a hip atmosphere. Truly an experience you have to see for yourself.

I had a sandwich called ""miss piggy"".  An appropriate name for hardy meets healthy.  I never thought healthy can be both scrumptious and filling.  I can still taste it and can't wait to try it again.

I tell everyone I know about this truly under-rated cafe\/restaurant I have ever encountered.  Somehow, I feel enriched by the experience.

THIS IS A MUST EXPERIENCE.  Take your friends, family and business associates for I guarantee all will enjoy!"	5	Bronze Cafe at The Center	4.5
Very good sushi, but customer service was terrible. Slow in the dining room on a Monday for lunch, but had to repeatedly flag down the waiter to get service. Server also got two roll requests completely wrong. Hopefully he was new, because food was quite good. Double salmon roll was delicious.	2	Yama Sushi	4

A 60 $ pre paid order and its not ready. 10 to 15 min what.Really, that's the normal wait. What was the point. Going back to L & L Barbeque . Further from me but better service."	1	Aloha Hawaiian BBQ	3.5
"Really nice venue in the Orleans. Band plays a little too loud early in the evening,  but  we're ""old"" & it's difficult to carry on a coversation with flourish music. Nevertheless, the band was good. 
Our server, TIA, was outstanding -& having stayed here & eaten at the Orleans in the past,  we were very impressed.
Tia was friendly & very on the ball.  She should train the servers at the breakfast cafe!
Also, kudos to Drew, great personality! the asst. server. Hey, Manager,  RECOGNIZE these workers!

"Can't rate this place as all the others because we never got our food.  WTH!!!!  When we entered, the other patrons had already been served.  Therefore you would think service would be quick.  Was seated before a party of 5 but their order was taken before ours, WTH?  A couple received their food before we did.  Matter of fact theirs was barely up under the heat lamps and they were served right away, WTH?  As we continued to wait the waitress and the owner continued to take orders of patrons who arrived after we did, WTH?  Then the waitress while passing our table asked us, ""were we ok""?  We stated we were still waiting on our food.  She looked surprised and went to investigate.   She then brings us our food which had been waiting under the heat lamps for about 5 - 10 minutes before the other couple's order, WTH?  When we decided to leave the owner had the nerve to say, ""but it was under a heat lamp"",  WTH?  

From what I could tell we appeared to be the only people of color.  Things that make you go hummmm!! And may I say again, WTH?????  Hence the lone star because I couldn't go any lower."	1	Bite Breakfast & Lunch	4.5
I was so excited to go here but left very disappointed. All of our food came out cold- likely was sitting for a bit. The server didn't check on us once. My burger was pink when I asked for well done. All in all a mediocre experience.	2	Wahlburgers	3.5
I ordered the nachos with steak and it was delish! It was a large portion; plenty to share or for an appetizer. The service was great and price was reasonable.	4	T&T - Tacos & Tequila	3.5
My new favorite! Delicious fresh food, friendly people, and they deliver!!! This will be my new go to place and I'm telling all of my friends. I ordered mild and the food came waaay spicy though. I would hate to see what the spicy option tasted like. The flavors were excellent and complex though. Pad Thai, and papaya salad were my favorite.	4	Plumeria Thai Cafe	4.5
Went here with a party of 9, surprisingly they got us in pretty fast. I ordered the California Eggs Benedict which is suppose to come with avocado, but i never received avocado with my breakfast. After waiting forever to get the waitresses attention she then decides to tell us they have run out. I would have like to have been informed before i ordered so i could have changed my order. The freshly squeezed orange juice is good. Didn't have a good first experience.	3	Stacks & Yolks	3.5
Great place to have wonderful meal. Went with my family and everything we ordered was delicious. The pot of bread is a fun little starter. I ordered the ultimate steak and eggs and it was cooked just the way I asked for it (medium rare... Yum) the chicken and chorizo burrito is huge, but taste great. If u are not a fan of spice be careful, it's loaded with Jalapeños. we did get a kick out of the waitresses wearing PJ's. All the staff was very friendly. The one thing I did find quite funny was the POS system that was mounted on the wall... It's mounted so awkwardly high.! Hahahah	5	Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place	4
Wow! I took my sister there because she heard so much about it, being from Kansas.... I'm her big brother and expected to treat her to whatever she wanted. We had fun, didnt get the hats we were expecting,  but still made the best of it and even ordered shots... When it came to the bill out server want happy with the Tip, even thought he messed up my beer order. He followed me out, questioning me about the tip amount... Then saying I'll take ur extra cup to compisdae  for ur lack of tip. I really didn't care seeing as his service was so bad, but I left with my little mug, and without him taking my big mug and our 3 diff shots we ordered.. We don't need the money let alone the food... We came for the entertainment	1	Dick's Last Resort	3

Reasonable prices for good food like Pepe's. Quick service and open 24 hours... so it really hits the spot whenever you're craving mexican at any time. I had the carne asada fries, didn't think I was gonna like it that much, turns out it was pretty damn good and its the only thing I will order.	4	Pepe's Tacos	2.5
I thought I was doing this business a favor by waiting till I go to the restaurant to mention that I saw a groupon deal for a brunch. Instead of buying it through groupon and having them get a 50% cut on their end.  So I went it and mentioned it to the waiter. He told me I had to buy it first through groupon, AND I had to wait 4 hours before I can use it. I asked why , because that doesn't make any sense. And thats when he told me "Groupon just doesn't allow us to have the vouchers used right away" ..... okay but thats not true. And whoever in there thinks its a brilliant idea to lie to customers is an idiot. I have a business myself and am a groupon merchant. So I know exactly how it works and it does not require a 4 hour wait to use. It doesn't even take a person who is a merchant to know that. It's obviously a setup to force the customer to pay full price. Which is not really an issue for me , but they way the business is shady about it and lying to people is not a good way to make customers. I wanted to use the groupon to try the food, see how I like it (regardless of the bad reviews) and if I like it, ill come back and ill be happy to pay full price. I understand that the business is trying to make it and would prefer to have full paying customers, but heres the thing, What's better? $30 bucks plus a good tip ( especially to compensate for the groupon) or $0 ? Because thats what they got from me, just for lying. And just for that, I probably won't give them another chance. What could've been a chance to make a customer, they made it so unreasonable and now I'm on here . And i didn't even get the chance to try the food. but from the looks of the reviews, it looks like i didn't miss out. Heres a tip for the crab corner, if you just want full paying customers, then I suggest you take down the  campaign and quit bull shitting .	1	Crab Corner	3.5
I live 3 minutes away from Ricardo's and I went on my birthday a couple weeks ago. The food was pretty alright but the what really sold me was their cocktails. They have a great variety and I got some coconut margaritas . Those were surprisingly good! My server was great and helpful when it came down to choosing drinks. I'll be back ! :))	4	Ricardo's Mexican Restaurant	3.5
Good food and great experience ! Kinda expected more out of the drink. Had a strawberry margarita .. Maybe just an off day but that's okay. I'll still be back. !	4	Margaritaville	3.5
Really amazing food! I got the turkey avocado with homemade chips. REALLY GOOD. The service was great and the way the place is so cool. Get ready to go back in time when you walk in. You can enjoy the 60s and 70s memorabilia while eating. The environment was awesome and the detailed interior design makes the whole experience so interesting. Super impressed over all. I'll be back !!	5	Rambo's Kitchen	3.5
Ever since I've moved to Vegas, I've been exploring all kinds of food. And this place introduced me to some real Cuban food and coffee. I'm a big coffee person. The stronger the coffee, the better. And the coffee here is perfect. It's strong but sweet. Not bitter at all. Which is my style. I had some Cuban tamales and the classic Cuban sandwich . (The real deal) it was wonderfully made and all tasted nothing short of amazing ! The place is nice and clean, the owner was super kind, and the overall environment and experience was pleasant. They also play live music on the weekend at 6, I definitely will be back to check that out. I highly recommend this place to try some quality Cuban and a good espresso	5	Cafe El Mundo Cubano	3.5

I've been meaning to write a review for this place for awhile , but oh my gosh I really loved this place :) great great food . I don't recall exactly what we had ordered . It a type of chicken with rice . I feel so bad that I don't remember exactly. The waiter helped us by giving us a recommendation. He was so so nice . I will be back !	5	Lazeez	4
The first time I went in here they had peanuts all over the floor.  Since I walk wth a cane I didnt like it.  I already have obsticles let alone peanuts on the floor so I can slip and fall.  I gave them a 2nd try and the floors were spotless.  Now to the food, the burgers are good and they do offer alott of condiments but they are over priced, the fries were good but they are overpriced also.  The coke machine they have in there is great.  It is a limited machine that offers you about 12 different types and drink then it offers you flavorings, ever try a orange Coke, yummy.  Be prepared to spend just for 1 person a single cheese burger, small frie, small drink, and tax $12.50.  Not a cheap lunch	4	Five Guys	4
We were at the Olive Garden just off of 95 and Cheyenne in Las Vegas about 3 weeks ago for dinner.  We have only had good experiences.  Its not always the good experiences that get written about.  We had a short wait in the lobby and then brought to our table.  We started off with the appetizers and we normally order the appetizer trio. and we picked the stuffed mushrooms, calimari, and cheese sticks.  We like to take our time so we always tell the waitress to take her time with bringing out the food so we dont get the apps, lettuce or soup and and entrees 2 minutes apart,  we like to enjoy.  Well the soups and drinks came out  with no breadsticks and had to ask for the breadsticks again before we couple take our 4th spoonful the apps were at the table and stilll not breadsticks.  We asked again and finally got them.  when the apps came, the protion size was smaller the usual.  Less then a handful or calimari, 5 stuffed mushrooms when there was 6 and the cheese sticks.  I made a comment when the waitress was there and she said nothing as if ignoring what i said.  I told the waitess to hold the main course until she saw that we were almost done with the apps.  Telling her this was like talking to a wall.  Within 5 minutes the main course was brought out and we were not even done with them.  To top it all off, I ordered Chicken parm and you would normally get 2 nice size pieces with a crunchy breading.  I was very dissapointed and I did call the company that owns them to tell them.  They sent a small gift card and asked that I call the next time we came in.  i did forget the mention that when they would put down a plate it was like they were intentionally banging the plates on the table.  Well we did go back and i will tell you what happened in my next review.	1	Olive Garden Italian Restaurant	3.5
"what a great experience. my son is in the navy and has been for 4 years now.  we had not scene him in almost 2 years and wanted to not only be with him but to take him out for a nice dinner. i heard many good things about the capital grille so we decided to take him there.  beside for myself and my partner, there was my son, my daughter and 2 friends.  we had just picked my son up at the airport and seeing my son come off that plane and seeing my son in his navy clothes made me tear up because i was so proud of him.  my son was shocked that we were taking him to dinner at the capital grille.  when we arrived there, we only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated so make sure that you make a reservation.  

the manager had come to our table and asked how we where doing which was very nice.  he said that there was a guest of theres that would like us to have a drink on that person and thanking my son for his service to our country.  that was so cool of that person.

i told our waiter that this was a special occasion after not seeing my son for so long and if she would come to our table with 4-5 different appitizers which she did.  she came with 2 orders of prsciutto wrapped mozzarella, lobster and crab cakes, fresh mozzareliia\/tomato\/ basi, calamari, and fresh oysters on the half shell.  our waiter even asked if there was anything else and we added 3 orders of chopped salad which we all split among us all and a couple of us ordered the lobster bisc soup and that was really good.

we all ordered steaks.  we ordered the aged porterhuse steak, fillet mignon, and delmonico steak.  we had lobster and cheese mac, green beans, and creamed spinich.

we all had the berries and ice cream for desert.

we also have some leftovers and even the leftovers were great the next day.

the manager had come back to our table when we were almost finished and asked if we enjoyed our meal.  it was all positive comments.  he thanked us for coming and and he thanked my son for his service,  that made me very proud.  our waitrer then brought us our bill and it said paid.  i asked the waiter that i thought there was a problem with the bill and she said that the manager had taken care of this and told me that it was their pleasure to take care of this and thanked me for my sons service.  

not only was this a fantastic meal, this had to have been a $800 dollar tab and for them to do that was a great jesture on their part.  the waiter was taken care of very nicely.

thank you capital grille for everything!"	5	The Capital Grille	4.5
Stopped with my daughter for the first time in over a year. I will not return.  There were no correct orders coming out. The food was tasteless and no one had a clue.	1	KFC	2
"Celebrated our anniversary at Gordon Ramsey Steak.  Start with the positives - the restaurant was beautiful!   We sat upstairs in a round, fairly private booth. The meat presentation was very cool and thorough. Food was delicious.   Mac n Cheese and baked potatoes were both excellent.  My filet was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  My husband's ribeye was a little overdone - ordered medium rare, came out a little more than Medium.  Sticky toffee pudding was yummy - extremely moist and the presentation was adorable.  

Now for the main negative.  Our waiter was terrible!!  Our server, Tony, was clearly upset that we didn't order any cocktails and, therefore, reduced the overall tip possibility for the table.  Once we indicated we were not drinking, his level of interest in serving us all but vanished.  Took him 10 or more minutes to come back to take our order. Discouraged us and other tables from ordering the beef Wellington (I assume due to time and desire to turn the table).  Didn't come to the table when the food was dropped to make sure we had everything.  Checked on us one time while dining.  Did get a little pep in his step when we ordered two desserts, but it was too little too late. 

Thank goodness for our great server assistant, I think his name may have been John.  He was great!!! Incredibly personable.  Spent at least twice as much time checking on us and chatting with us than our waiter did.  If I could have requested that my full tip had gone to the assistant, I would certainly have done so."	3	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
"Food was delicious.  Had a little something for everyone.  Desserts were the best - love loved the banana bread pudding.  

Only negative was service.  We had two rounds at the buffet before we even saw a waitress to get a drink.  Ordered just soft drinks and water, so we were pretty low maintenance.  She was very nice, but seemed a little overwhelmed.  We did ask the hostess three times and then a manager before someone decided we were worth helping.  Very disappointing as we are Platinum Total Rewards members."	3	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"Amazing. Simply fantastic.  Cannot say enough wonderful things.  My husband and I were in Vegas for our anniversary and decided to do a little celebrity chef steak comparison.  We ate at Craftsteak and Gordon Ramsay steak.  Craftsteak was the Hands Down winner in every category!   Food was incredible.  The cheese grits were to die for.  Steaks were simple and well cooked.  Food presentation was lovely.  Monkey bread for dessert was yummy!!  

Where Craftsteak really stood out was in service.  The servers used a partner system, which worked great.  I believe our two servers were Marlon and Bleu.  One spent time walking us through the menu and the other took our order.  I liked this approach because it allowed one to make recommendations and the other took the order so you didn't feel badly if you didn't take their recommendations.   

Overall, fantastic experience at Craftsteak - will definitely return on our next trip to Vegas and will certainly be recommending to friends."	5	Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak	4

So so good! We were down the street at Tesla and it was getting late so on the way home I ordered for pick up from here based on yelp reviews. The place was completely empty at 5:30pm on a Friday. Makes me scared they will close down. It was super clean inside. The food was delicious. We ordered the chicken panini, grilled cheese and super turkey w\/fries and chips. My family all shared and agreed this place was crave worthy! Even the fries were amazing, they had a lemon pepper seasoning on them  that hit the spot.	5	Great American Food	4
Vegan tacos!!!!!!!! They are so delicious. I can't wait to go back and I'm still stuffed from the meal we just had there. The fried avocado, jackfruit and veggie tacos were amazing. The vegetable empanadas were the probably my favorite. The drinks were great. I loved their salsa. We were a giant group with 8 kids included and the service was very nice and prompt.	5	Tacos & Beer	4

My son and I recently had dinner at this restaurant in the Pallazo owned by Mario Batalli and I have always wanted to eat at one of his places. We sat at the bar and had incredible service from Eric and Cooper. We asked them what the best things on the menu were and they instantly recommended the steak tartar and the grilled Octopus to start. We ordered those and they were insane...cannot believe grilled Octopus could be so tender and delicious. So then they said we need to share the bone in Sirloin which had been aged 120 days. It to was fantastic and they actually carve it off the bone for you table side. I cannot recommend this place enough but I think sitting at the bar made the difference for us as the conversation with these two bartenders was really fun	5	Carnevino	3.5
"On our recent trip to vegas my husband and I wanted to try out something new. I came across this place with such pleasant reviews and luckily for us it served halal meat! 
So my husband and I went for dinner here. We ordered their famous spicy basil fried rice because of the numerous good reviews I read about them. And we were so not disappointed. Loved them! Their tom yum soup was good. Not great. And the thai beef was okay too."	3	Sakina Thai Cuisine	4.5
Long wait so please be patient hot hot hot it's Vegas. But worth cheap and good tacos	4	Tacos El Gordo	4
Absolutely love the red velvet cupcake. But it always sold out thou. And their savoy chicken crepes. The price for chicken crepes is reasonable compare to other dessert item.	4	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
This is my 2nd time here and I love it. I just love all the Mongolian BBQ and the unlimited sauces. Gillbert is our server and he is very attentive to our needs. Will definitely come back again and try different pot base:)	5	Chubby Cattle	4.5
I've been here twice already, very impressive with the taste of their food and the environment. I like their spicy intestine in hot plate.	5	Mala Restaurant	4
Spicy rice cake, love the little sweetness within the spicy, goes perfectly with the dolsot bibimbap. Come here after a gym work, it's all about eating healthy while still tasty.	4	Q Bistro	4.5
"My girlfriend booked reservations here a month in advance.  As you can see in other reviews we too had to wait 45 minutes still to get a table after our reservation time.  That didn't bother us really but the food did.  Terrible.  Anyone who thinks they have good food probably ranks Burger King as their favorite burger.  I had the lobster ravioli-the portion was ok- but after one bite I was creeped out by its taste.  It comes with a baby lobster tail, that I literally had trouble cutting w\/ a steak knife because it was so tuff and stringy.   We also had Alaskan King Crab legs-  You could get fresher crab legs at shithole here in Chicago in Chinatown.  They're fishy and just plain low quality.  My girlfriend loves shrimp and ordered the shrimp scampi-she at about two shrimp before the toughness and grainyness creeped her out too much to eat.   She also had mashed potatoes-somehow they managed to come up with a unique taste to make mashed potatoes bad.

The view is great-thats it.  Go here if you are just want to sit in the lounge and drink.  The seafood is so bad that even if you love seafood you will not want to eat it for awhile after eating this garbage.  The inside is somewhat rundown as well.  Our waiter barely could speak english and was actually helped by other waiters at somepoints because they could see (or have seen before) that we could only  make out half of what he said.  If this place weren't on top of the stratosphere every review would say ""I wanted to puke after one bite of my meal.""  The prices are expected for the atmosphere, but to have such a great atmosphere and a terribly run place is ridiculous, but I guess expected since no one would ever need to go there twice with it being in Vegas.  They know they can bend you over and they certainly do."	1	Top of the World	4
First time having Korean BBQ, really enjoyed it! Wonderful selection, great service and yummy food. Very highly recommend!!!	5	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5
Great service! Chris is awesome and very helpful! Food was great as well! I'll definitely come back. Ask for the first booth! It's everyone's favorite apparently like Anthony Hopkins, Tim Allen, and Ron White!	5	Portofino by Chef Michael LaPlaca	4
The service MUST get paid a lot because they clearly don't give a damn about their customers. Our server only had one other 4 top, there we're 5 of us. She never brought the straws we asked for. I had to go to the bar, where she was talking to another coworker, to get straws. I ordered clam chowder and it didn't come with crackers so I asked for some. 20 minutes later, after my soup was gone she brought me 2 packs. She was the one who cleared my freaking bowl off the table. Our entrees had clearly been sitting under the heat lamps for a while as they were a similar consistency of either rubber or a rock. The shells were cold, the roasted veggies were cold the dipping sauce, "piping hot", was freezing. The manager eventually saw how pissed we we're and came over. Immediately, she got us napkins, it had been a while since we asked, and put new lobster tails on for us. Our server, seeing the manager at our table comes over with an outrageous amount of napkins and throws them on the table, after we already got them from the manager. I was floored by how interactive the other servers we're and how happy their tables we're. I would come back but if younger Juliette ask for another server.	1	Rainforest Café	2.5
I was expecting something amazing as I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay.  The food was good but my burger came out wrong twice.  First time it was missing a topping and second time it came out welldone when I asked for Medium.  The server and manager were apolgetic and the burger still tasted good.  They had a great beer selection and our server was very knowledgable.	3	Burger Bar	4
"Looking for a place in Chinatown, I stumbled across Wendy's Noodle House.  I had chefs spicy chicken, my dad had the Portuguese curry chicken, both were great!

Service was quick, efficient and helpful when ordering.

Vegetable spring rolls were perfect, light, not too hard, delicious.

I'd go here again, for sure!"	4	Wendy's Noodle Cafe	4
"Food was very good, waiter (Chris) provided excellent service.  They did sit us on temporary chairs (by the kitchen too) though.

Not much use even posting this because they are closing soon."	3	Nobhill Tavern by Michael Mina	4
"This is pretty good buffet and doesn't get the recognition it deserves. They advertise that they were voted the #1 buffet in Vegas a few years back but most of my friends never think about going to Planet Hollywood to eat the buffet. They have fairly decent selection and the quality is higher than Rio's but a notch below Bellagio or Wynn.

Nice Middle Eastern selection, frozen custard, and king crab legs for dinner!"	4	Spice Market Buffet	3
"Overall, a great buffet. The weekend lines are always long so you need to come prepared to wait at least 30 min to 1 hour. The quality of the food is a notch above all others and at the same level as that of the Wynn. I've tried both and I give the Bellagio buffet a slight edge. 

If you have to try one buffet in Vegas, this is the one."	5	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
"My wife and I were staying at the JW Marriott down the road and wanted to have a nice dinner. The restaurants at the hotel got dismal reviews, as expected, so we found E&R on Yelp, and I am SO glad we did.

Walking by the Ferraris and Porsches parked in the valet right outside, we entered around 5pm on a Saturday and were greeted by the hostesses. We didn't have a reservation, and they said the next spot for dinner wasn't until 9:30pm...but that we could take any of the open seats at the wide-open bar area and have the full dinner menu. We happily took the high-top right next to the window and I immediately ordered a Moscow Mule.

Even though we were seated in the bar area, service throughout was awesome. Our server went through her recommendations for appetizers and main courses. We had the portobello mushroom fries for our app which were...so incredible. Highly recommend.

For entrees, my wife had the Shrimp and Artichoke dish and I had the Spencer Steak. Both were delicious. Countless times throughout the meal, my wife and I looked at each other and wondered if this was one of the best meals we've ever had. Everything just tasted so good.

The decor and feel of the place is awesome too; classy, but not too fancy. A lot to look at in the lobby as the raw bar is right there along with the butcher shop area and other cool stuff they sell.

Get to Echo & Rig; truly a 5 star experience."	5	Echo & Rig	4.5
I would give this restaurant 0 star if I can! Bad bad bad service. none of the food really stood out....we  3 girls went to eat. The YOUNG manager charged us 10 dollars with 3 rice left over. If only 3 dollars we would pay. ALSO he had really bad attitude and threaten us that he would call police if we don't pay the 10 dollars....... At the end he throw the check on the table. We were really scare that he would punch us to face at the moment..... Never come bk to this place...	1	Umiya Sushi	4
Fried chicken was amazing. Crispy and tasty. Waffles were great I don't know what they put in the watermelon but they were little pieces of heaven.	5	Yardbird Southern Table & Bar	4.5
Loved the ambience and service. Really enjoyed the food and the setting. Will definitely be back	5	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
OMG, this placed SUCKED! One of our large group called the night before and let them know we were going to want separate checks, the manager said no problem. We got there, got seated, ordered and then we waited... 98% of the table got their food, the remaining 2% of us got our food after everyone was done. My pasta was swimming in lemon butter sauce, it was way too much.  They took the bottles of water off our table and quit asking\/serving us any water after that.  When it came time for the checks, they came around AGAIN and asked us what we had. We had to go through our orders again.  They said it would be a few minutes and they would bring the checks back.  FORTY minutes later, they came back and said what we ordered didn't jive with what we said we ordered. They said it would be another five minutes to sort it out.  No way, this place was a joke. The manager made lame excuses.  The majority of us ended up leaving money on the table and walking out.  They got WAY more of a tip than they should have - I didn't want to wait around for change. From the beginning of our night there to the end was a complete disaster.  The food isn't even close to being Italian, just make this place a "P" for pass.	1	Romano's Macaroni Grill	3
great place. Hot line, bar & tables. Smells great inside. Different types of beers offered, some on tap. Root beer on tap, big menu, vegan & gluten free friendly if that's your thing. Food tastes great. Seriously, if you have a problem with this place - you have problems.	5	Great Links Brewhouse & Grill	4
IHOP is always good. Been to several and this is my favorite location. They have plenty of parking, and no busy street or traffic to fight. I've been here several times. Yeah sometimes service is slow, sometimes it takes awhile to get a table, but overall service is good, food is good and the prices are not to bad. At my recent trip, we sat down quickly bacause we asked to sit outside ( TIP alert - they will usually seat you right away if your ok with sitting on their patio) It was late in the morning, hadn't eaten a thing despite having been up since 5. Ordered the  fajita omelet. It came quickly, and hit the spot. Will I come back? Could be there now.	4	IHOP	3.5
Favorite place to eat on the strip. Its exiting and fun with free entertainment. There are videos on a huge screen of Jimmy Buffet concerts , balloon animal makers on stilts, the margarittaville girl sliding down and dancing around when they play Volcano, and the crowd getting into the act when they play Margaritaville. Despite this place being at the Flamingo - I give it 5 stars. I can't understand people giving this place a poor rating because of the food. If you want fancy grub, fine go somewhere else. Hello, its called Margarittaville, what did you think? Vegas has a ton of places for you to be bored at, so go pretend you're on a food show somewhere else. With that said, I think the food here is  good & def good enuf for me and have always had good to great service  Of course ill be back, in fact im probably at the table next to you with a giant balloon contraption on my head.	5	Margaritaville	3.5
Great place! Great food and great service. I loved this place. Its small yeah, but I don't mind. I really liked it. We went for lunch on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy , so we walked right in and sat down. You have a choice of sitting at a counter ( thats right a real cafe counter) or at tables. Four of us had 2 Monte Cristo sandwhiches (thanks Yelpers for the tip that they served these here - hadn't had one in many a day) ( and no , were not big eaters) They were great, service was great, definitely will come back and in fact this is my new favorite place to eat lunch.	5	The Cracked Egg	3.5
Canes proves that its not the size of the chicken finger, its what they do with it that counts. haha Great chicken fingers, great bread, great service, great sauce, fries are soso. High school football teams, cheer teams and dance teams from Arbor View, Centennial and Shadow Ridge usually stop by before or after a game - so you know this place has good food !!  Also, very interesting Chuck Norris facts on the wall. - Chuck Norris is so fast he can run around the world and punch himself in the back of the head. - When Chuck Norris does a push up, he doesnt lift himself up, he pushes the Earth down. haha & ha. Eat Here! Chuck Norris says so!	4	Raising Cane's	4
Good food, great location, great service, great place to people watch. Located in the front of the Paris hotel. Outdoor dining is available which looks over the Strip and is across from Bellagio. Sugar Factory is next door. Seating is somewhat squished in though, and you have to trek through the casino to get to the bathroom, but oh well . Place is busy , so reservations would be a good idea. Parking avail at Paris garage.	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
Best place to go for a beer,  wings or to watch sports.	4	Buffalo Wild Wings	3

Projection tvs,  big flat screens, tvs at your booth, tvs everywhere. And no problem seeing them from across the room like other supposed sports bars (Blondies). Arcade and video game area upstairs. Food and drinks are great though pricey cuz its the strip. Had a good time.	4	The Sporting House Bar & Grill	3
This place should be called beer pong bar because that's all there is.  Well, plus some to small 40 inch tvs so far away they can't easily be seen. Wont go back.	1	Blondies Sports Bar & Grill	2.5
Never seen one of these outside of a mall, so you can imagine my surprise when on my way to my typical sandwich shop, I spotted this hidden gem, and to boot, it had a drive-thru. Shut. Your. Mouth. Service was friendly, just remember that they're frying up your Dog on a Stick when you order it, so it's not lightning-speed service; you may have to wait a bit, but it will be oh-so-worth-it. Keep your peepers open, because if you blink you'll drive right by it!!	5	Hot Dog On a Stick	4
"So based on the Yelp reviews I came in to try it out for myself. I walked into this spotless restaurant and I ordered my guilty pleasure and once a month craving of nachos, except this time I ordered them with Al Pastor. Can I tell you? These were divine. The meat was smoky, sweet, and tender. The generous amount of guacamole was made with some jalapeno in it and gave the nachos that awesome spiciness I was craving. Oh, and the guacamole? Real stuff, not that neon green stuff you get at other places. The beans tasted like homemade pinto beans, not the refried stuff that usually comes with nachos. Everything on these nachos worked together perfectly. The bottom of the nachos did get a little soft towards the end but that's why you get yourself a fork and call it a day. 

What made this visit amazing (other than the delicious food) was the awesome customer service they're dishing out. I was greeted by a very friendly young lady who proceeded to ask me if I was a first-timer and if I worked nearby (yes, we spoke in Spanish so I had no language barrier issues, deal), she then proceeded to offer me samples of all their aguas frescas (literally, ""fresh waters""), yes, all of them. One by one I tried them all and, surprisingly settled on the spinach (try it before you judge me!!). Not only is the food a welcome change in this neighborhood, but the friendly service makes this one of the very few places that still know how to talk to a paying customer. 

I will definitely be returning, and taking as many people as I can with me (I'm Mexican, we travel in packs). This food and service deserves to be shared and I promise to do my part. Always in support of a small business!! Anda Frijoles (oh, by the way, that means ""beans"")!!"	5	Frijoles & Frescas Grilled Tacos	4
Enjoyed lunch here on 01\/15\/14. Bulgogi fries were good, not sure what I was expecting. Wontons were awesomely delicious. Quick service when calling in an order. Next time I will dine in and I will definitely give them another try.	4	KoMex Fusion	4.5
I opted for the adobada fries (everyday special) and for under $7 I had some deliciously crisped fries topped with guacamole, cheese, and tender carne adobada. Went with the habanero salsa and it gave this Mexican a run for her money. It was pretty legit. Will definitely try again but for now it scored a home run!	5	Habaneros Taco Grill	4
"Can't believe it's taken so long to visit El Gordo. Here's the rundown:

Yes it's greasy Mexican food. No, it cannot be good for you. Yes, the adobada fries are the best I've ever had. No, I am not sorry I ate them all (in my defense, half an order). 
It gets hectic inside so pay attention and move swiftly! 

I ordered the half order of adobada fries ($5) and they were more than enough. Good fry to meat ratio, and absolutely delicious!!

Yes, I will be returning. No, I will not bring you back a taco."	5	Tacos El Gordo	4.5
I really, really liked this place. We went in on a Monday, a holiday Monday and surprisingly they were still honoring their M-F lunch specials. We tried their pepperoni calzones and our 4-year old had their cheese pizza. We all loved our meals and the delicious ricotta added to the calzone made it extra delicious. Our kiddo, needless to say, loved their pizza. Not only is the food delicious, but their customer service was top notch. It is not always about the food, but also about the pride owners take in making their food. This place did not disappoint and we will be returning.	5	La Bocce	4
Ate here last week while on lunch. Other than the long line, is there really anything to say?? It's In-N-Out people, it's delicious! Can't go wrong.........	5	In-N-Out Burger	4
Delicious. Ordered the double cheeseburger wig everything on it and I was SO glad I did. Fries were pretty good, so glad there was a drive through and I was able to eat in my car. Similar to In N Out but a whole lot meatier!! Loved the friendly and speedy service. Will definitely return and next time with the whole family.	5	The Habit Burger Grill	4
"Visited on Father's Day around 5:30 (40 minute wait). We hung around and enjoyed their Crispy Chicken Sandwich (messy, but so worth it). Little one had the grilled cheese and fries (meh) and we ordered a couple of side Caesar salads. Service was attentive (even considering how slammed they were), manager was around and visible (even brought out food samples while we waited outside!). 

Only reason for the missing star is we ordered a calamari app which was seriously over-salted (might have just been a kitchen error, but it made it inedible). Server took it away without any issues, manager followed up and offered a replacement app, but by this time, we were ready for dinner. We definitely appreciated the attentive service and manager follow-up and totally understood that this was just an oversight. 

We will definitely be returning to this location, if only for that perfectly crispy chicken sandwich (dipped in buffalo sauce, served with a refreshing aioli....mmmm...) and that never-disappointing Caesar salad."	4	Outback Steakhouse	3.5
I totally enjoyed this place. Not the best area,but as always, looks can be deceiving. Ordered a snow cone, smoothie, and a fresh juice. My juice was on point. Pineapple, oranges, and strawberries. Delicious. Only snafu was when the guy at the counter forgot I had ordered it. So I waited, and waited, and waited. When I mentioned it he totally owned up, apologized profusely and even offered a freebie scoop of ice cream for his mistake. I love it when people take responsibility for their errors and move on. This kid blew me away. I also loved this fresh juice and will definitely be returning when in the area. Always glad to support small businesses.	4	Cherry Berries	4
This place was simply delicious. Perfect recipe for what makes these types of places last. Great food and great service. That's it. That's all it takes. All you chain restaurants out there thinking that your name speaks for itself, do yourself a favor and check out Rollin Smoke. This is how it's done. Keep it up guys. You're doing an awesome job!!	5	Rollin Smoke Barbeque	4.5
Ate lunch here on 10\/8\/13 and was very impressed. Ordered the Tree of Life, side of baba ganoush, and some sort of off-the-menu vegan, pumpkin\/banana smoothie. LOVED the freshness of all the ingredients, LOVED the Tree of Life (even though I am not a vegetarian or vegan), LOVED the friendly counter service and friendly delivery to our table outside, and I LOVE what The Center is doing for the community as a whole. Sign me up for any establishment that is working to make things better in our town.	5	Bronze Cafe at The Center	4.5
Enjoyed the view here. Pretty much the only place to stop by for a bite while up at Mt. Charleston. Went on a busy day and it was quite hectic. Enjoyed my sandwich (even though they forgot to include the bacon the menu promised me) but did not enjoy hearing the staff complain about how "over" they were with the crowd. I get it, customer service can and does suck sometimes, but we don't want to hear it, we just want to eat. Might return for some of their famous spiked coffee, but definitely not in a rush to get back up there.	3	Mt Charleston Lodge Restaurant	3.5
"Heard Rika was going to be at Bad Beat Brewing on 08\/09\/14 so we decided we DEFINITELY had to get down there. Rika's not frequently in Henderson so we definitely had to take advantage. 
This place is delicious. I ordered the shredded beef arepa and the chicken\/sausage arepa. Both were delicious. Served hot and with a side of fried plantains. The chicken\/sausage was my favorite. The arepa itself is slightly crispy on the outside which makes it a perfect little pocket for all those delicious fillings they put in there. 
I have not been to the ""other"" arepa spot in town, but I've had Rika three times and can honestly say I frequently look at their calendar in hopes that they will be near me. Their drinks are delicious and the arepas are pretty close to perfect. The owners are also always very friendly and helpful."	5	Rika Arepa Express	4.5
Finally made it to Babystacks on a Saturday morning. The wait was not as long as you would imagine and it moved pretty fast. It was definitely busy though. Tried the Kalua Pig Benedict and my husband tried the Loco Moco. Everything was delicious and perfectly seasoned. Also split the Red Velvet Pancakes and they were also worth the wait. Not as sweet as I had imagined them being and a short stack was perfect for sharing. Looking forward to them opening their Henderson location. Will definitely be back and looking forward to trying more dishes on their large menu!!	4	Babystacks Cafe	4
$5 lunch specials every day, all day long. You can't beat that. Small restaurant attached to Doc Hollidays. It is still family and kid friendly (they do have a kids menu). Good food, delicious salsas and great service. I do hope they succeed. I will definitely be back for another one of those $5 deals!!	4	Maribel Mexican Food & More	4
"I really enjoyed this place. Visited on 06\/14 (Saturday) around 11:30a. Waited about 30 minutes for a table. Had the Denver omelet (4 eggs!, ham, peppers, and cheese), husband had the mushroom Swiss burger, little had a pancake. The omelet was delicious and so were the home fries. Husband enjoyed his burger (was juicy, NOT dry). Little one polished off the made from scratch pancake. 

Truly, it is hard to make out of this world breakfast food, but there's something about a good breakfast spot that smells of delicious fresh-brewed coffee when you walk in. The pancakes were light and fluffy and delicious. 

Staff was very friendly and checked on us throughout our meal. We never had to ask for anything. This in itself is worth another visit. And maybe another one after that......"	5	Mr. Mamas	4.5
Tried Which Wich today for the first time and was able to use my coupon (free reg sub w\/purchase of chips and drink) which I received after signing up for their email\/online offers. The sandwich itself deserves 5 stars, however, I'm docking one due to the poor customer service. Maybe these guys were just tired from working the lunch rush, maybe they've had a long day, but in my experience, nothing excuses poor customer service (please also keep in mind, I've too had a long day but was still able to thank you and smile). I've read about their stamp card, but wouldn't know anything else about it since it wasn't offered (and I just remembered as I logged back unto Yelp) :( Maybe next time.	4	Which Wich Superior Sandwiches	3.5
Okay, so all the Yelpers below were right about the delicious food. I went with the Pad See Ew and it was divine. Walked in during lunch hour and there was not a big crowd. I ordered food that was ready in about ten minutes. Plus I got a free Thai iced tea for checking in and a pork dumpling as my appetizer. Delicious and filling meal for less than $10. I will definitely be back and I will definitely do my part to make sure this place sticks around for a while.	5	Pam Real Thai Las Vegas	4
"So I've just returned from lunch and realized I've never reviewed Braddah's. The more I eat here, the more I love it. I've had their bowls and burritos, and of course, the coconut bark. I love the Kalua Pig and normally get that, but I've also tried their steak and chicken. I seriously just love getting the bowl because they can fit much more in the bowl than they can in that tortilla! 

Customer service is always on point and everyone appears to truly enjoy working here. 

Please note, that it's ""just like Chipotle"" in the sense that you go through the line picking what you want on or in your entrée item, but it's in no way ""just like Chipotle"" in the flavor sense. There are countless variations of their menu and it's all yours for the taking. I'm so excited to keep on coming back here and am even more excited that there will be one coming soon to Henderson (right??!!)."	5	Braddah's Island Style	4
Delicious! Went in on a Friday afternoon, ordered a pork burrito lunch special, for $8 I got a huge burrito, chips and salsa, and a canned soda. Was so excited when I heard they had a standalone shop, as I would normally frequent them at the local farmer's markets. Hope they're here to stay since their food is delicious and the service is awesome.	5	Pancho's Kitchen	4.5
"Had an awesome birthday dinner here for my husband thanks to our server Craig! 
We took advantage of our rewards card and started with the Garlic, Artichoke, Spinach Dip which was delicious (especially those little cheesy triangles of deliciousness they serve it with).
For entrees he went with the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccine which he couldn't stop raving about and I decided on the Fettuccine with Tomato Compote and Kalamata Olives (which I wasn't too sure about when I ordered, but was SO glad I did, because it was delicious and under 600 calories!) Our 3 year old had the kid's pepperoni pizza which was delicious and more than enough for him (and such a steal at that price point!)
We finished off with a free birthday dessert (thank you Brio for taking that extra step for us!), and the kiddo enjoyed his kid's ice cream sundae.

Our server was wonderful, he was friendly, attentive (but not hovering), and made our dinner extra special. We truly appreciate the wonderful customer service and delicious food to boot. Thanks Brio!"	5	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
Will definitely be returning if only for the delicious Peet's coffee. Had the éclair, but it was filled with chocolate cream instead of the traditional cream. Still yummy, but unexpected and a little too sweet. The coffee was delicious and the outdoor seating was perfect for the nice weather we were having  yesterday.	4	La Belle Terre Bread French Bakery Café	4
Bad first impression. Went in with a coworker who had previously had an awesome experience and was excited to share. There was a large group of guys sitting nearby who were being overly loud and cursing left and right. It sounded like a bar in there and no staff member or manager said a word to them. It was obvious that they were bothering the majority of the people dining at that time. Our server only checked on us once, our salads were mediocre, my coworker actually left hers alone after only three bites (the server didn't even notice this or ask if there was anything wrong with it), and once he picked up our bill he went and sat down at a booth with a group of girls he was obviously friendly with instead of running our bill. The previously excited coworker vowed not to return, and although I was excited and had waited a while to try out MTO, I think I'm good on it now. There are plenty of other options downtown that offer better service.	2	MTO Café	4.5
I love Fat Boy.....I love that it's a Mom and Pop, I love that their meat tastes fresh and not frozen, I love that the bread gets all the same loving that everything else does. I don't love that they're so far away from me or that they have such a small indoor seating area. Whenever I'm in the near vicinity I stop by here. I've had their double cheeseburger and their Chencho fries. Both are addictingly delicious and fresh. I always want to try something new but my nature keeps me going back to my usual order.	5	Fat Boy	4.5
Delicious food and wonderful service. Enjoyed the Greek crepe as well as the Berry one. Awesome how their menu is not limited to sweet crepes. The mimosa sampler was delicious. Enjoyed being able to sample their top 3 (peach, blood orange, and guava - LOVED the peach one!!). Service was wonderful and they offer outdoor seating which is awesome as long as the weather is right. Will definitely be returning to Crepe Expectations!!!	5	Crêpe Expectations	4.5
"Truly a gem among Las Vegas top-tiered restaurants.  The setting and the art work are sure to WOW anyone.  But the food preparation and attention to detail were first class all the way.  I was going to take my gf to Giada's across the street, but after reading a few Yelp! reviews about Giada, and one person said it would be wiser to take your money and eat at Picasso, I decided Picasso was the place to try.  And I was right.

My gf is a vegetarian, but not vegan.  When we first were seated and shown the menus I was seriously thinking that we would have to leave.  She doesn't eat any fowl, seafood, lamb, or veal.  Explaining to our waiter, Robert, our dilemma, he asked if she would like to see the vegetarian menu.  Voila!  Problem solved, and gladly done.  

If you are put off by the high prix fixe costs, then put on a brave front.  It's worth every penny.  I'd rather spend $350 on a dinner for two that is memorable, than $250 on a dinner for two that is regrettable. Forgettable.  Not worth it.  If you can understand that feeling, then visit Picasso.  We will again.  It's not an everyday restaurant, nor should it be.  It's a Michelin 2-star restaurant that should be savored."	5	Picasso	4.5
The space is spectacular. The menu so French subtle and sophisticated.  The service at the bar soooo unfriendly.  Has happened more than once and we keep wanting to go back because we want it to be so good.  Rats. How about a smile?  Does anyone that works there ever smile?  Lighten up and be kind.  You are in the service industry.  Love the beers on tap.  Good food isn't so good with disinterested slow service.	3	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
Very good food - Also try Brownstone Pinot Grigio - Great friendly service	5	Elements Fine Casual Dining & Cocktails	4
WOW.. Happed to check places for brunch around my area and found this gem!! It's located in the shopping center near eastern and Serene. Service was on point and food was 5 stars! not your average cafe. You can tell they are very selective of the Ingredients used. The prices are great for the quality and service. This place is a must try for sure. Can't wait to go back	5	Boteco	4.5
HORRIBLE SERVICE was trapped in the drive though for 20 min!!!!!!!! They could warn people of the wait!!! Unbelievable- employees are rude and have a bad attitude DO NOT COME HERE	1	McDonald's	1.5
food is decent. The place is small but okay for lunch type of place the service was great as I was the only person in the place. the prices are decent overall was not great but not bad...	3	Galanga Thai Eatery	4
Great tasting fresh sushi!!! Highly recommended.. best higher end sushi in the city!!! Decent potions for being higher end.. definitely my new sushi spot	5	Katsuya	4.5
I came to check out this place despite the mediocre reviews actually pleasantly surprised that they have very good pizza at a very good deal I took 15 minutes to get my pizza which is expected not sure why it has many bad reviews maybe has to do with the delivery part but I would definitely recommend this place.. Actually very very good pizza	5	Angelina's Pizzeria - Eastern	2.5
Finally had a chance to try this place and was very disappointed.. Food is overpriced.. Burgers are mediocre nothing special.. Fries had a greasy taste to then... Expected more based on the hype.. Felt like it's totally a tourist trap.. Habit Burger and In n Out are way better if you n the mood for a burger	2	Shake Shack	4
I love the food here it is so good and all of the staff is very kind and humorous.  This my all time fave restaurant - (written by my 11 year old daughter)	5	Geisha House Steak & Sushi	4
Order was not taken correctly.. I got mash potatoes instead of french fries.. They were out of biscuits and still charge me full price for the combo... Chicken was stale and dry.. Very disappointed.. I would recommend raising canes nearby if you're in the mood for chicken strips	1	Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen	2
Highly recommended if you are looking for a good sandwich, soup and salad casual place... they have a great variety of options. I also really liked the unlimited refills on a few mixed fruit tea options if you want to drink something different from your typical soda fountain options.. only negative about this place is unfortunately they are closed on Sundays	5	Cafe Zupas	3.5
I ordered my food through the drive-through.. My order was and minimal wait time.. maybe three minutes at the most.. The season fries were nice and fresh.. I've probably been here about five or six time so far so good always consistent fast service that's why I'm giving them 5 stars	5	Checkers	2
"My new favorite sushi spot!!!
This place can compete with the high end
Sushi places in town."	5	Yummy Grill & Sushi	4.5
Pizza was okay.. was a little too greasy for my liking.. chicken wings were good.. prices are okay.. will only go back because it close to home..	3	Mama Depalma's Pizza & Bistro	3.5
Best original mexican tacos in Las Vegas - does not get better then El Gordo's!	5	Tacos El Gordo	4
Inside the New York New York Vegas Hotel & Casino, right next to the check in\/check out counter. I only came here to get some donuts because they look really really heavenly. Got some Boston Creme, Glaze, and a Strawberry donuts. Those donuts were really big. They were heavenly delicious. High calories, but who cares you're in Las Vegas.	4	America	3
"The first time I had Earl of Sandwich was back in Disneyland, CA. I thought it was any ordinary sandwich spot. I was wrong, I thought it was one of the tastiest sandwich spots I have ever tried. 
Once I found Earl of Sandwich inside Planet Hollywood, I had to get me some. Ordered my two favorite sandwiches there. The Tuna Melt and the Hawaiian BBQ sandwiches.
 
The Tuna Melt (Albacore tuna salad, Swiss & mayonnaise) was oh so good. They pack a lot of tuna in the sandwich. This is the one sandwich where I don't need extra mayo because they put the right amount in there. 

The Hawaiian BBQ (Grilled chicken, ham, Swiss, pineapple & BBQ sauce) is a sweet, tangy, and tasty sandwich. I like it when BBQ sauce meets pineapple. It is one awesome combination. 

Definitely one of those snack on type of places or for late night munchies. A good substitute if you don't want to pay for an expensive dine in meals in Las Vegas. Just need to the manage the long line."	4	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
I love a good buffet in Las Vegas and The Buffet at Bellagio is no different. Good quality tasty food. A wide selection of food. There are some food that you see here and won't see at other buffets. I definitely like their selection of pastas, seafood, and huge assorted meats. My dessert go to was their little mini donuts. The buffet interior is very lovely to dine in. It is a bit pricey for the buffet, but you're in Las Vegas. The prices are the norm here. Definitely a top notch buffet in Las Vegas.	4	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
"Best buffet that I have been too. It is also the most expensive buffet. 

Located inside the Caesars Casino and Hotel. This buffet costs $52 per person for the buffet buffet. $52 for hundreds of dishes to try. 

The food includes a seafood station, classic American food station, craving station, Mexican station, Italian station, salad station, Japanese station, Chinese station, and a dessert station. 
The food are really good here. This buffet takes more time in making sure the food is on point and are presented nicely organized.

I recommend eating some crab legs and shrimp cocktails. They were quite delicious. I would also try the udon and ramen noodle soups because they were very tasty and the soup stocks are good. 

Being that I'm Chinese, I was quite surprised that the Chinese food were decent here. They had dim sum and it was good. I kept going back for the congee. 

Unlimited drinks here, but you should really go for the guava juice in the Mexican station. Really good juice. 

The only downside about this place is the wait. Depending on how many people you have, it could be a wait. 

The restaurant has a really nice ambience and it's a good place to eat. If you don't mind the wait and price. It is rated one of the top buffets."	4	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"Located inside the Cosmopolitan lies a yummy buffet waiting for you. It is one of those high end buffets. When you walk in you think you are in a fancy restaurant except you can come in with shorts, tank top, and flip flops. The interior of this buffet is really gorgeous.

A lot food options to choose from. There are salads, cocktails, soups, sushi, seafood, crave meats, desserts, noodles, etc. Majority of the food I ate were very appetizing and delicious. I really like the crab legs, shrimp cocktails, desserts, and especially the seafood soup. The seafood soup is made on the spot for you. Just tell them what kind of soup you want and what seafoods you want in there. I opted for the white wine with some butter and all the seafood. It was so good. 

Unlimited drinks on all non alcoholic beverages. 

The service is really friendly and quick. Ready to take your empty plates once you are done. Presentation of the dishes are still nice for a buffet. 

Worth the trip and your stomach."	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"AWESOMENESS!!! 

I almost got them confused with another ""Raku"" in the same plaza at first, but the other actually sells grilled food I believe. The place is very brightly lit as everything is ""white"" and gives off that clean, upscale eatery vibe. On a Thursday night there was a 30 minute wait for the counter where all the action takes place, but trust me its worth the wait as thats where all the action awaits!

First off, the menu itself is edible and its super cool to watch yourself stuffing paper bits into your mouth with mouthwatering peach sauce to use as dip.

Dessert we ordered the prix fixe menu for $19 which comes with:
- mango sorbet with green jelly-delicious! A must for mango lovers!! The flavor was super strong with a hint of sourness. 
-Jack in a cup-a chocolate souffle with a choice of vanilla or chocolate creme filling which is injected in front of you using a cool pipe-looking gadget and a half ring of nuts, fruity marshmallow squares, and popcorn I believe? This specific dessert was a little too sweet\/rich for my liking so I only ate half..
-cream puff- crispy puff with a light semi-sweet raspberry filling.

From the a la carte menu $12 we ordered:
-Stella ( strawberry tiramisu)- probably the most beautiful presentation of all with a small strip of fresh fruits and light airy cream but I didn't try the actual bread portion.
-carib? MY FAVORITE! A wine glass filled with kiwi, banana, pudding, then topped with a thin lid which is melted as hot fruit puree is poured on top creating a cascading effect.

All in all it was well worth the wait and a unique experience, but the desserts are slightly overrated. We found ourselves a tad grossed out after finding a hair sticking out of the comped cookies and noticing the chef cutting fruits and plating the desserts with bare hands...but no biggie because we still ate the food."	4	Sweets Raku	4.5
"We came here because I love high tea and we were able to get a comp for this place.
Located inside Bellagio next to the lobby and the casino area, this place can be easy to miss. We originally had an earlier reservation but called to move it an hour later since we were running late. Well we went to the MLife counter and claimed our comps for our 4:30 reservation. We got there and this oh so snooty hostess lady whos probably in her 30's told us that their high tea closes at 4 pm and that our reservation was for 4 and not 4:30. I told her that I was next to my husband when he said 4:30 then she proceeded to argue with us that they said 4 pm. Okay..whatevers lady (rule of thumb, never argue with your customers)..so I asked the lady if theres any way we can still have the high tea since we are leaving that night and our comp will expire. She said she'll ask and left the booth never to return.The two of us stood next to their podium for about 15 minutes before someone led us inside. In between this time, two other couples were greeted and seated so other patrons were probably wondering why we were just standing around..can you say awkward...

Finally when we did make it in our tea was set up and our waitress was wonderful so my stars are for her actually. She was the only person who didn't make us feel out of place in this pretentious place. We got the two people serving so we each chose three flavors of mini sandwiches and shared the pastries. The food was really so so though and my peach oolong tea (can't remember exact tea) was not exciting at all. 

My three stars was given because they actually still gave us our high tea although we were ""late"", our server was sweet, and lastly because of the interior ambience and setup."	3	Petrossian Bar	4
"Came here due to word of mouth, billboards claiming they are #1 in Vegas, and also because it was one of the selections in our buffet of buffets deal. So we chose the wrong weekend to come to vegas since every single buffet we visited was SUPER JAM PACKED (it was the week of the jewelry convention). The line for this one was so long it wasn't even funny. We made it in 30 mins before they were closing and I beelined for the raw oysters and seafood section. I must admit, the presentation for every single food item was beautiful and you could tell they spent a lot of effort, but I really was not blown away. Maybe I came when it was busy in Vegas or maybe it was near closing time but I mainly picked at a couple food items I liked. 

I ate massive quantities of my favorite shrimp cocktails and raw oysters. Some other notable foods were the black chicken soup in the chinese section (tasted VERRRY authentic so I give them props), their cheese and salami section, and also their gelatos, and chocolate strawberries. I would suggest offering maybe milk chocolate on the strawberries as well since some people HATE dark chocolate...hint hint..also the japanese section had no sashimi...!?!!? what!?!?...just some simple cut rolls that looked not so appealing..

Some of the food items I didn't even get to try since it was closing time and they were wrapping things up which was another thing that annoyed me. If you are a buffet and you let people in near closing time then at least let them get all their food before you start shutting your bars down! 

Overall, I think this place is a one time deal...since I'd much rather pay much less and get literally the same foods (minus the oysters) at other top notch vegas buffets."	3	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"This buffet was on my must try list after seeing so many rave reviews on Yelp. I made sure it was my #1 stop after arriving in Vegas, luckily there were no lines because we arrived at 5 pm which is when they open for dinner.
Each table is set up beautifully with wine glasses, heavy silverware, and a bottle of free wine along with a glass bottle of water.

Now, for the food...
-shrimp ceviche was AWESOME!!! With a sour kick I had thirds I think...
-Shrimp cocktail with shells I ate so much of my cholesterol is probably off the charts!
-hummus dip with a crispy tasty toasted pita?..delicious!!had seconds as well.
-cheese bar like any other Vegas buffet
-prime rib was soft and super juicy with tons of ah jus sauce.
-bone marrow was different from what I imagined..seemed like it was all FAT inside but the ones I'm accustomed to is actual soft bone marrow..so it was bleh..
Mac& cheese bar : the guy working was supercool as this finicky eater asked for spinach, onions, tomato, bacons, mushrooms as toppings. And guess what?! Its made of REAL CHEDDAR!!!
-their salad bar is pretty decent with my favorite whole wedge of iceberg lettuce and other kinds of salad already made for you. 
-theres a dish..the watermelon with some creamy sauce on top which was o so delicious!!
- pecan brittle with bleu cheese also yummy!
Lastly, dessert!! Their dessert section was nicely set up. My husband loved their cheesecake...supposedly the best cheesecake hes ever had???
- their gelatos were delish so we tried multiple flavors like blood red orange, rasberry sorbet, thai, NUTELLA, cookies n cream, almond.
- oreo covered chocolate strawberries were awesome! What a cool new twist!!!

You must try this place at least once even though its so expensive...our total came out to 80+ tip for two people which is high for a buffet BUT you are getting good food. Compared to Bacchanal, I prefer this place, but my husband likes the Caesars one better because hes not a fan of seafood and felt he didn't have too much food to indulge on ;)

"Woooo pizza!!! A SECRET pizza place?! Awesome!!

On a recent bachelorette trip my friends and I decided to make it our personal mission to find this secretive pizza joint after hearing about it from the bride's fiance. We navigated the area based on some Yelp photos and were actually very closeby when we got ""lost"". Imagine our excitement when we found THE HALLWAY!! We decided to each get 2 humongous slices of the pre made combination, pepperoni, and cheese toppings. 
-The cheese was very tasty with a slightly thin crispy crust. It was indeed pizza heaven for us UNTIL we decided to sprinkle too much parmesan...making the sodium level skyrocket and our mouths dry as a desert on our drive home to LA...hence my minus one star.
-The combination was pretty decent but nothing too special topped with big slices of sun dried tomato, bell pepper, olives, onions.

At $5-6 a slice its really not too bad so it'll be fun to bring along new people as a little joke."	4	Secret Pizza	4
"I loved this place the food is amazing the tortillas remind me of my grand's home made tortillas in Mexico the drinks are excellent and the custumer service is great that why I tipped them 20% my parents and friends recommended me this place and live going there all the time. I can't wait to go visit their other locations my friends have told me great things about the other locations

I had the chicken enchiladas and they were great but the steak picado that my brother had is definitely something I want others to try it's amazing"	5	Lindo Michoacan	4
I really love this place so much, their food and customer service is awesome. I've only ever ordered delivery but it's always fresh, delicious, they're able to make my favorite dishes vegan and my boyfriend loves their orange chicken. My favs are their tom Kha soup and I tried their veggie egg rolls today- sooo good ( I had already ate a couple before the pic, lol). Their chow mein was good too. At the end of the day, I've eaten at many Thai places in Cali and Las Vegas and this place is my favorite!	5	Thai Pepper	4
This by far is the worst resturant in caesars palace. I'll never come back here again!	1	Tiger Wok & Ramen	2.5
"The food is excellent. The service is pretty friendly, but extremely slow. I did wait 1 hour for one plate of food when it wasn't even busy so that was pretty crappy. But it was good food. The restaurant itself, aesthetically, is also nice. A bit dark for my taste though (I do happen to prefer restaurants with more natural light, keeps the mood more alive and happy)   
All in all I give it a 4."	4	Market Grille Cafe	4
"The food was good... but the service was just abysmal. I know that I go through a good bit of water in a meal, but is it that hard to fill my water glass?

Just over all disapointment."	2	Mother's Korean Grill	3
I think that the setting was more enchanting than anything else... in the middle of "Saint Mark's Square" within the Venetian Hotel and Casino. The food was decent, and even inventive on a few things (though not so inventive as to turn off the tourist trade), more than anything else the service was amazingly slow.	3	Postrio	3.5
This was just absolutely amazing... and even better, it was comped for the four of us (ask me about this great story at some point). Even better, it was for my Birthday dinner with JMa, Chris, and John. What great company. Our server, Amy, was fantastic. The food kept coming, the wine was great (and even had a different bottle suggested, after the order was placed, based upon our tastes with the meal... what attention to detail).	5	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
What a great little mid afternoon snack... JMa loved the pear bread pudding... I was very happy with the chocolate macaroon. Priced a bit high, but really, I think that for the quick on the run food for the epicurian, it was amazing.	4	Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian Casino	4
I was just given a bag of Christmas cookies from this bakery, when leaving Josette's Bistro, and I have been snacking on them all day... crisp yet chewy (not sure how you do that, but it works) and so delicious).	5	Josette's Bistro	4.5
"I grew up on this stuff... and now that I live in New England, Macayo's is one of the first stops I make when returning home to Las Vegas. My family keeps those ridiculous gigantic margarita glasses at my Grandmother's house, just so they can have one more (this could set me off on a tirade about how margaritas, and mexican food in general should be simple and cheap... but if you are reading this in Las Vegas, you already know that). 

The chimichangas are amazing, the chili rellenos are outstanding... really, I think by now I have had everything on the menu, and I long for it from the other side of the country. 

Eat in good health, and have a bite for me!"	4	Macayo Vegas	3.5
"It was great to be able to find a cute little Thai restaurant (at the recommendation of a good friend from High School) to be able to visit while I am home in Las Vegas (going through withdrawals from Thai Taste in New Haven, CT). 

There are a few dishes that I really just am a sucker for on any given Thai menu, and therefore use them as standards by which to judge the various restaurants. Tom Yum Goong, which is a clear broth soup made with lemon grass, mint, and chili paste and really just is a fantastic starter encapsulating the various flavor combinations which Thai food has become famous for incorporating. Here, they did not have a small, single person serving (lest you wanted this as a whole meal, versus just as a soup on a cold day), but it was so flavorful, I did not mind (nor did the other people at the table who, unbegrudgingly ate their portion). 

As an entree, I love the noodle dishes, and close to my heart is the Yai Kee Ma-Ow (read: drunken noodles). Here they were chewy and had just the right amount of sauce to coat the noodles, but not to leave them swimming in excess. I ordered them with pork... oh pork, how I love you... which was just on the right side of crispy without being overdone. 

Finally, for dessert, it does not matter what Asian inspired restaurant one visits, it seems that they all have banana spring rolls... though here we had, what we were told, was homemade coconut ice cream to boot! Yum!"	4	Thai House	3.5
"I had just finished speaking at a conference, and wanted a place to sit down for a meal... and found my way to San Marco, which, after reading Heat (about Mario Batali), how could I do anything but sit down for a meal here. 

The service was fantastic, food was pretty darned good (the pork belly ragu was yummy... but the vegetable antipasti were just amazing)."	4	Enoteca San Marco	3.5
"This place is incredible! It's hip and modern and brilliant. $8 to build your own pizza with as much of whatever you want on it. Service is quick and pleasant. 
Blaze Pizza has so much potential! I really hope they add more locations in the Summerlin (Cheyenne, lake mead, rampart) area."	5	Blaze Fast Fired Pizza	4
"Waffle Cafe is amazing! The two guys that work in here are very friendly and always provide great service. The food is incredible and unique. We don't have anything else like this in Las Vegas, at least not in the Centennial area for all I know.

Portions are great, food is amazing, service is on point. You can't go wrong with this place."	5	Waffles Cafe	4
The bartender, Megan, was the rudest woman I've ever met. She gave the worst customer service I've ever experienced and was extremely neurotic and unpleasant. Pizza was amazing, wish I could say the same about the service...	1	Five50 Pizza Bar	4

"Umm where to begin... 
Upon arrival we were sat immediately, it wasn't busy. We arrived for lunch and was told someone would serve us soon. A good 12-15 minutes passed and people after us were being served, then finally someone asked if we had been helped...

First off the food here is good, they just need to get their shit together. I ordered Hamachi Kama, which is not on the menu but was stoked that they offered it because I LOVE HAMACHI KAMA. I ordered that shit first. After about 30 minutes, and after seeing 3 hamachi kamas go this family, I asked to check on it. Only to find out that the family got my order and they ran out. Thanks gorilla sushi for letting me down and thank you to the family for just taking my order and not refusing. 

We also ordered Udon in which our server insisted TWO TIMES, it took long because the kitchen was backed up. It's not busy at all, how long does it take make udon? Apparently 30 minutes. Come to find out they lost the order and it was ready after 3 minutes after ordering it a 3rd time...

We left not satisfied, and still missing a few dishes. Big up to the server for crediting us just one AYCE because of their fuck ups... 

HEREs the bottom line. Your food is good, you really need to re-evaluate your service. Your servers do not know which table is which, as I heard them counting. You lost points with me when my hamachi Kama, which I love so dearly was given to someone else, and you take long for service... A simple sorry will not do, our server apologized for their fuck ups like a dozen times... 

Wouldnt mind trying here again but until then, I will not returning until they get their shit together... This is what I get for a restaurant that has a grand opening with a gimmick of half off..."	2	Gorilla Sushi	4.5
I really just came here for the beignets lol. BUT the people here are very nice... Cashier had a smile, and I really treasure customer service... Maybe some other day I'll try some sandwiches but 5 stars just for the service and the beignets are AWESOME!!!	5	Streetcar Po-boys	3.5
"Two stars. Good atmosphere. Workers were friendly. However I do wonder about prices. 

I got me THE OG, a combo of my fav sushi which is ahi, yellowtail, and salmon, which runs about $12.95. A drink added to it brought the total to $15. 

Good! However, I wasn't impressed. Left still hungry. To be honest, another $5 more and you could go across the street and get all you can eat and leave absolutely full."	2	Tail and Fin	4
Awesome place... Island style favorites with a twist... I usually just get my favorite which is Pulehu Steak and Seaweed Rice... You know diet right... but the taste is great, and the owner took time to talk story with us... Will be returning and I'm already suggesting my IG friends to go...	5	Braddah's Island Style	4
Food good, not amazing. Shake is alright, it did come way later than we expected. I would've gave 3 stars however there is not a worker in sight with a smile or personality. I will probably not return here at all.	2	Steak 'n Shake	3.5
Best tasting pizza around... No doubt when I'm looking for some pies I go and order from here... They've been gracious to me and I can't thank them enough for all their customer service! Thank you!	5	Verrazano Pizza	4
Quite possibly the best rib place I found here in Vegas... While I love other places, not to mention those other places are good... For the price, environment, and service, I definitely will be back here and also continue to being friends... Beef ribs, all kinda of ribs, in fact the whole menu is just bomb...	5	Rollin Smoke Barbeque	4.5
Food is okay but a Lil overpriced.  How do you go from 6.99 sandwich to adding $5 more for fries and a drink?  I could've got a crispy chicken sandwich from jack in the box and still be satisfied.	2	Fuddruckers	3
I think it's sad that the place i'm about a mile away from the place and I'm considered outside of the delivery zone... I know guys at the University would BIKE even farther... these guys drive cars... sad	2	Jimmy John's	3
"First and possibly last time I ever eat here... Umm tip, CHECK YOUR CHICKEN. In a rush, I came in for the first time to teriyaki boy right after working out at LVAC. I asked for dark chicken, w rice n veggies.  Order came up rather quickly.. BONUS points right? Upon looking at the chicken further, I'm noticing it wasn't grilled or anything, just looks like plain chicken. Then I'm thinking, did they microwave this, how did they cook it? Chicken came to me a little pale looking rather cooked... I take my first bite, not bad... Upon completing half the bowl I notice a few pieces that were not cooked... I brought it to their attention, they asked if I wanted something else. I said ""no"" due to the fact they might give me more undercooked\/microwaves chicken... 

I'm betting that if I DIDN'T ask for sauce on the did I wouldn't have noticed it... So for future reference CHECK your chicken..."	2	Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill	3.5
So I'm currently here... 3:45, 4 they cut off lunch prices... There's 14 chairs, only 4 are sitting yet we can't sit for lunch... There's 7 chefs... Never had a problem here until this hostess was here... I've never seen this hostess... If I see her again, I will not come back...thank u for pushing us for dinner prices before we could sit for lunch... Thank you also for sitting us next an annoying loud young couple... Also I had to remind the waitress of our orders... Will most definitely not be back... You're better off at sushimon...	1	Sushi Kaya	3.5
"Can I give negative stars?...if so Tao would get a negative 2,000. I planned my sister's bachelorette party and could not have had a worse time. I paid for a bottle service and they wouldn't let two of the guests who contributed to the table service in... How is one suppose to have fun when not everyone is allowed in?!? I tried speaking to the ""manager""of security and was met with pretentiousness and hostility...please do yourself a favor and do not come here if you want your group to have a good time. Overrated and I will never, ever come back here again.

Ps. People chain smoke in here, making it impossible to breath in addition to the rudeness you are met with at the door. Awful!!!!"	1	Tao Nightclub	3
I have come here in the past and wasn't disappointed, but my recent experience made this restaurant lose my business. I came in the other evening and I was ignored for over 20 minutes while the short Asian bartender talked to other customers. She also used profane language in front of other customers very loudly. I left without being served. Would not recommend this establishment.	1	Nacho Daddy	4
Visited on 7\/25\/16 around 7:45pm and sat at bar. This place typically isn't my first choice but besides fast food there isn't a whole lot around and didn't feel like driving down Blue Diamond. Went in with low expectations as I didn't get the best service my last visit about a year ago. Was very smoking inside which was not friendly to my asthma. Servers name was Cherlyn (sp?) and I was helped right away. We ordered a 10oz and 7oz filet as well as calamari and drinks. The calamari lacked flavor and was very skimpy especially for the price. The filets were much better. The server helped us with all our questions and concerns and seemed to be running the show herself and I felt bad about keeping her so busy. Long story short... A better visit this time but due to the outstanding service rather than food. The smoke needs to be handled and options other than steak need to be reevaluated.	4	Montana Meat Company - Durango	3.5
We had a Groupon for the former Bally's Steak House that was replaced by BLT Steak.  We stopped in on Monday, Oct 16, to see if they would honor it.  The manager came out and was so nice and gracious.  He looked it over and said it would be no problem.   We were expecting a "Sorry, but no" response, so we were pleasantly surprised. We were planning to return later for dinner, so the manager offered to sign it so we would not have any problems.  We walked out feeling great and anticipating our return for dinner.   Dinner was fabulous!  We had the Dover Sole - it was light and flaky with a mouth-watering brown butter sauce.  Hopefully I can get that again someday, as I am already craving it.  The green beans were cooked perfectly al dente. We ate at the bar and the service was fun and friendly, yet not in any way intrusive.  Our bartender knew the perfect balance of when to visit with us and when not to.  Loved the food and the customer service was outstanding.  It was our last dinner after 5 nights in Vegas and it was the best.  A definite repeat!	5	BLT Steak	4
"Had lunch for the 2nd time at Giada's on  Oct 16.  The Maitre 'D who seated us, didn't smile or offer any sort of pleasantry.   Not a very welcoming first impression.  He did ask if we wanted a booth or a table.  I asked if we could see the choices and he led us into the dining room and then stopped.  We all stood there awkwardly until I finally said, ""we'll take a table"".   It was a great location but didn't know beforehand as he didn't point anything out.  The stiff, formal vibe continued with our server. 

I asked about the bread basket - she said it wasn't served at lunch, but that she would bring me 1 kind of bread - I had 2 choices.  She was not very gracious about it.   There was too long of a wait to get our wine, considering the restaurant was not crowded.    Received a small tray of condiments consisting of salt, pepper and toppings for toast.  Two of the dishes were chipped and one of the toppings had a skin on it from sitting around for too long. 

 About ¾ of the way through our meal, I noticed a bug swimming in my wine.  I have no idea how long it had been in there.  We are seated by open windows, so I understand that these things can happen.  It took a while to get our server's attention as she was helping a large group.  When I was able to get her attention, I didn't complain or make a big fuss, I just pointed out the little visitor in my wine.  Her response  was to say - ""My Apologies.  I will get you a fresh splash"" and she walked away.  I would have expected her to promptly remove the glass, but I had to look at it for awhile longer.  She did come back shortly and remove the glass.  It seemed to take longer than necessary to get a replacement.  When I did get it, it held the ""exact"" amount as the glass she removed.   She must have measured it, or maybe just removed the bug.  Then she proceeded to lay a cocktail napkin over the top of our wine glasses to prevent further bugs from landing in our wine - at least that's what I'm assuming, as no words were spoken.   No other guests had napkins covering their drinks. I'm not sure what her intent was, but the impact of her actions resulted in us feeling like children needing help.  We may be ""seniors"", but we do have all our faculties.

At most restaurants, I think the wine would have been comped or at least it would have been a more generous pour.

The décor is stunning and the food was good, but not good enough to bring me back to a restaurant  with such formal, stiff, and  seemingly indifferent customer service.

As a comparison, we had dinner at a Steak House that evening, and we were blown away by the very friendly and pleasant treatment we received by their staff."	2	Giada	3.5
I just finished dining there, and due to the long wait chose to sit at the bar. I just wanted to tell all that I thought the bartender was fantastic, I was there just to zone out, and not be bothered, and he did both. Very friendly, engaging with all the customers, but left me and kept making sure that my drinks were filled until I was ready to leave. Then once I was ready, checked me out got me on my way. Even took enough time to notice my name when I paid (with my credit card), and thanked me for coming in my name. Of course I didn't have catch his but great bartender!	5	The Cheesecake Factory	4
The beef bowl is outstanding; the Inari Sushi was very good and the Snow Puffy for dessert was one of the best pastries I have ever tasted!	5	Paina Cafe	4.5
"As you might hope from the name, their burgers are pretty decent. I ended up creating my own Kobe burger and it was pretty tasty - meat was tender and cooked medium rare as ordered. However, the ""Kobe"" beef was ultimately lost on me; it didn't taste noticeably different from regular beef. The skinny fries, on the other hand, were salted nicely and cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. 

The bar, TVs, and skimpy waitresses did give the place a somewhat confused vibe (since it also has an aspiring upscale burger joint feel to it). Also the $60 foie gras\/Kobe beef\/truffle burger just screams garish excess - literally packing every expensive ingredient in for the sake of it à la Donald Trump."	3	Burger Bar	4
"I enjoyed a nice dinner here with colleagues while in town for CES. The restaurant offers a variety of steaks as well as new American fare. Although I didn't get the opportunity to sample any appetizers, my sea bass with risotto was excellent - the bass was seared perfectly, and the risotto was flavorful and creamy. My sautéed spinach side dish was good, and my coworkers all seemed to enjoy their meals as well. Though I didn't particularly care for any of the desserts on the menu, my server was able to whip up a nice affogato for me. 
Service was friendly and attentive, doing a good job of keeping water glasses full and responding to requests. Overall, this place is a good option if you're looking to have a standard upscale dinner"	4	Stack Restaurant & Bar	4
"I had an enjoyable dinner here during a trip to Vegas for CES. The menu contains the standard Morimoto fare (modern Japanese\/fusion fare), and is essentially a clone of the Napa\/NYC locations. The rock shrimp tempura was solid, and the selection of nigiri I ordered was fairly high-quality as well, with fresh cuts although nothing out of the ordinary. 
Service was very friendly and attentive, and a wide variety of wines, beers, sakes, and cocktails are on offer as well. However, I did find myself wishing for a greater variety of sushi, and I was somewhat disappointed that omakase was not available. That being said, this place is definitely a decent option if you're looking for decent-quality sushi or upscale Japanese fare."	3	Morimoto	4.5
"I'm a Nobu fan and generally enjoy visiting locations in different cities. The food and service here are par for the course - I sampled some perennial favorites, including the rock shrimp tempura, crispy rice, new style sashimi, and miso black cod, and all were executed without issue. Service was attentive and friendly, and the interior design is evocative of the old Tribeca location.

However, the restaurant location\/setting was disappointing and poorly representative of the brand, to say the least. I have no idea who thought it would be a good idea to open up a Nobu at the Hard Rock Hotel; it would seem that their target demographics do not intersect at all. This is the only Nobu I have been to that has deemed it necessary to post a dress code at the entrance, which only helped minimally.

And rather unfortunately, the restaurant itself does not have bathrooms; one is forced to exit into the casino area to use the public restrooms, which feature needle disposal boxes."	2	Nobu	4
"I decided to eat here on a whim while looking for a decent place to eat dinner while in Vegas with friends - the name sounded intriguing, and the decor seemed whimsical from the outside. Although our server was decently friendly and attentive, the food was somewhat of a letdown.

I decided to order the scallops along with a glass of Riesling. The Riesling was far too sweet and absolutely terrible - I felt too bad to actually send it back but had the server offered a small taste before pouring the whole glass, it would have definitely been rejected in lieu of another wine. The scallops were also disappointing; although seared well, they arrived at the table only lukewarm, and the overall flavour profile of the dish just didn't really work for me. As a main course, the dish was also rather small and could definitely have used something starchy like a small accompanying risotto. 

That being said, the service was decent and the interior has an interesting Victorian apothecary-esque theme. The drink menu is also on an iPad, which while cool, was actually a tad cumbersome, especially since the comparison and suggested pairing features weren't working too well."	2	Rx Boiler Room	4
"I had a dinner here with colleagues during CES and while I thought the food was delicious, our meal was marred by subpar service and poor timing. I sampled a variety of small plates, including the Hokkaido scallop crudo, tuna tartare, duck and waffle, and uni\/avocado toast. All of the dishes were very tasty and proportioned well - the seafood was fresh, and the duck\/waffle was decadently rich. 

However, service was a definite lowlight. I didn't receive the cocktail that I ordered until halfway through the meal, and dishes came out erratically with absolutely no attempt at proper pacing, with our table fluctuating between barren and overly crowded with plates. An order of shrimp cocktail and grilled octopus were evidently both forgotten - the shrimp cocktail arrived only at the end of the meal, and I ended up canceling the octopus order as both items were clearly inputted only after we inquired about the long wait after we had finished the rest of our dishes. The service recovery attempt was fair (all drinks comped), but the consensus of our party was that service was ultimately subpar and inexcusable despite the CES crowds."	2	SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill - Las Vegas	4.5
"Was wandering around Mandalay Bay with friends after a night out clubbing looking for some late night drunchies and we were directed here by the staff.

Despite it being 3am there was a 10-minute wait, which we spent pondering the menu. We ended up choosing the tater tots, penne prosciutto, and kobe chili cheese fries. Maybe it was the alcohol, but we thought everything was delicious and devoured it all. Service was pretty decent too, and the prices were quite reasonable."	4	Citizens Kitchen and Bar	3

"SECRET MENU.

want to try a variety of all their fried offerings?  ask for the secret menu.  it has a piece of fried chicken, fried shrimp, and fried shrimp.  plus fries. although everything was of a high quality of fried-ness with nice touches of herbs, the fish is definitely the best.  

fries--they're not steak fries as some other people have written--but those british style ones i get in pubs. not french skinny, but english stolid. :)  i loved them.

sauces were all fine--but really, the tartar basic was my favorite. also had the toffee shake--very caramely.

after the meal, i did feel a bit salted up--so be sure to hydrate with lots of water. but overall i'd come back for the fish and the chips (skipping the other foods there). top notch and well done, GR and crew!"	4	Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips	4
"Ten in the morning, feeling crappy from the night before, went here for a quick brunch. Wasn't feeling too hungry so I ordered just a sashimi platter (I heart salmon) while my friends ordered their way more complicated to make asian cuisine entrees. Half an hour later, everyone else was done eating and there I was cursing the heavens for my ill fate. Not really, but I was a somewhat pissed. I mean, really, how hard is it to slice up some freakin salmon, right? I know for sure doesn't take half a freakin hour. Bah, so I called the waiter and had my order cancelled - he did apologize - then gave me a bowl of miso soup with rice. WTF. I thought that was pretty insulting so I got a little more pissed - who the hell eats rice with miso soup? I know I don't. Asked for our bill, two minutes later - guess what? Here comes the waiter with my freakin order - that I clearly asked to be freakin cancelled. AND I was gettin billed for it! Now at this time I just really honestly wanted to cuss him out but thankfully for him, I'm not that kind of person. Kept my cool instead. Then when I reminded him I had it cancelled - mf had the nerve to have an annoyed look in his face. I was about ready to explode but decided to just get up and leave. F*&(*@~!!!!

I'd give it just one star but I went back the next day because again, we just wanted something quick, ordered some kind of noodle entree - that turned out okay, good portion - but I guess just right for what you're paying.

Probably won't go back here though, mediocre food and bad service just really isn't my thing."	2	The Grand Wok and Sushi Bar	3.5
"Nob Hill. Hmm.. 

Great place - I loved the atmosphere and all. Service was excellent too. I would've given them 5 star but I thought some items in the menu were subpar. That and we had to wait for a little more than an hour to get our food served. 

We were checked in at MGM and was looking for a decent place to have dinner at so we decided to try Nob Hill out since it was just downstairs. Made a reservation for about 10 people. Got there in time, table was ready - great presentation by the way, then were seated. Served bread, took our orders, then a little over an hour later, finally served our food. I do appreciate the fact that they recognized their fault though, they even served us complimentary mashed potato sampler - which I really couldn't care less for - for it. 

Got my Grilled Wild King Salmon. I gotta admit, it looked pretty damn good - but ah, looks can be deceiving. So took a little piece, put it in my salivating mouth - EH. Was a bit dry. Lacked flavor too. Ended up not finishing my meal.. I did try some Foie Gras though and i thought it was pretty much perfect, made me think maybe it was just ordered the wrong thing. A bit too expensive for what you're getting - but that's just based on my experience. I definitely would give them a try again though."	4	Nobhill Tavern by Michael Mina	4

"it looks like a typical place i would NOT eat at... fake nostalgia?  BUT the donuts displayed in the window actually looked good and weren't a total rip off. the service lady was very friendly--like what you'd expect at a neighborhood donut joint. a bit sassy and cute (she was an older lady). she is almost all the caffeine anyone needs in the morning.

basic cronut--flaky and fresh--great execution. a very noble copy of the ansel version in nyc. all they need to do is set up a fake line of hipster mannequins (see urban outfitters) which we can cut like a kardashian--then the experience would be truly worth $4 per cronut!  (can you say social media picture opp?)

also, maple bacon bar--a delight of sweet and smoky\/savory. 

i usually go to ronald's donuts on spring mountain--but i do enjoy america's donuts quite a bit (even if it was $6.98 for the two donuts--that's a dozen at ronald's!).

there are a lot of great eateries inside ny ny.  definitely way better than being stuck in caesars.  they mgm people are doing a great job of making this property very attractive with the many interesting food options that i actually go through the trouble of getting to."	4	America	3
"VEGAN WARNING--perhaps triple check your food--find pictures on yelp and compare it to what you get.  

* if you order vegan, keep the order simple and do not distract the wait staff with any witty repartee or compliments while ordering.  you can always joke around AFTER the correct order comes in
* when you get your dish, compare it to pics on yelp of vegan chicken, cheese, etc. if it looks TOO good to be true,... it just may be real chicken.

yes, i had an experience ordering the well reputed vegan chicken quesadilla (nachos also get a great rep on yelp). even asking a waiter if my order looked like real meat because the cheese\/meat looked so amazing. he assured me it was the vegan version; then, a few bites later he warned me it was actually real chicken. (it was a mistake--probably in the ordering process.

they replaced it.  offered a a drink to apologize.  no management came by at the time, but the training manager at nacho daddy read my review and wrote me personally to get more details of the incident--so they could avoid future problems.  thank you, taylor."	2	Nacho Daddy	4
"I really enjoyed my experience at MTO.  a 4.5 star restaurant is always minimally enjoyable. And in this case, with the service, validated parking, and setting, I enjoyed my breakfast here.

I ordered far too much--but there are a lot of good options on the menu.

* blueberry lemon pancake--nice rise, fluff, and not overly sweet.
* red velvet pancake--on this one day it was a big tougher and as sweet as one might expect. probably a good hit for the kids at your table that like chocolate
* kfc plate:  i finally tried mashed browns--i know it's a simply gimmick--but it worked to get me in. :) overall--a good choice for a filling breakfast--i only wish the fried part were more crunchy\/fried. it'd have been nice to have the contrast between gravy and crunch.
* coffee excellent

I had a nice woman training as a waitress, but they clearly work as a team. 
good ambiance--good for either family, business meeting, or couples morning after
parking validated for 1 hr
bathrooms have clever gender signs (eggs, sausage)"	4	MTO Café	4.5
"was craving a fried chicken sandwich. and as i've eaten at shake shacks all over the world, they do deliver good overall quality. the food was a tad bit salty but that was not a surprise, but the chocolate malt was especially good. the last time i came in march--the lemonade and burgers were great.  (free refill on my lemonade!)

my main reason i wont be coming back to this location is the parking policy started in april 2016.  if you drove in, you have an hour of free parking--after that, it's $7 additional for whatever food you are trying to spend money on at the MGM hotels. now, for any food place, there's going to be a line or wait. the line at the shack shake takes at least 10-15 minutes. i found myself trying to nudge people along in the line--and the cashier's are not arrayed in a clearly visible manner off the main queue. it must be so frustrating for them to keep waving at distracted orderers. it's a lot of pressure to wait 15 minutes in line, then another 10-20 minutes for the food--and shake shack is about the farthest distance from the parking garage that could be imagined.  i ended up feeling like i had ran a sprint, waited, ate like crazy, and sprinted back to the car.  

i do admire that the employees there are fairly productive but quite nice to the customers. there was one annoying customer that kept asking for additional thing after her burger arrived--she had misunderstood that the regular burger (even though it says on the menu clearly) does not come with toppings. but the food distributor lady was very polite, even after several requests by the lady for this, that, then the other. she has quite the patience.

shake shack is solid. the employees work hard. but for the price and all the competition out there, it's not worth the stress of trying to complete a nice dining experience in under 60 minutes, esp with the parking garage a full 5 minute sprint away. i'll save my shake shack visits for other cities and, in las vegas, i'll stick with a place with free parking or 1.5 hours of validated parking..."	2	Shake Shack	4
"I'm from Hawaii.
I might say the plate lunch I had at Island Flavor might be better than most places in Honolulu? wha? sacrilege?

Ok, they don't have fountain fanta fruit punch (which has a strawberry accent) like in Hawaii... but everything else--delicious.

The service is of a local flavor--the friendly kind. I wanted to try two things not typically ordered together, and the waitress was super flexible about it.  Yes!

The teri beef was delicious--and if it was salty--i only noticed it after the meal. But what I most appreciated was that it had a good char from the grill they have in the kitchen. Also, the cut of meat was not tender in itself (skirt or ny?) but it was handled perfectly. It had both a solid beefy taste and with the slices of meat going across the grain, each piece was mouth tender. It was a beautiful, expert touch. The teri sauce was solid--not like mainland style teriyaki--but local flavor.
The sweet sour spareribs--also quite good--a tiny bit oily. big piece of ginger, and turnips, carrots--it was good and hearty--like what you'd make at home.  not as good as the teri beef though. I ended up finishing all the teri beef and taking the SSS home. And PS--it tasted great as leftovers later that night.
mac salad was solid
Haupia cake--also world class. Reminiscent of Napoleans (Zippy's) in terms of the lightness of the cake.  I would not be surprised if the owner's used to run that bakery or someplace like that. All that cake for only $5!  

I'm so full again. Two meals in from one plate lunch (and a piece of cake)

Clearly these people know what they're doing. I have to really search to give any suggestions at all:
* Is it possible to make slightly better rice?  Pressure cooker might make the rice stand out too? The steamed rice scoops were pretty dense and was the weakest part of the meal. 
* I found myself waiting to pay for quite a while at the register.  It'd be nice if the wait staff took the payment--but hey, I won't complain."	5	Island Flavor	4.5
"service--very friendly and helpful.  order taker was nice and cared about me being happy. and there was a nice young man who went around asking if i wanted another cup of water--good kudos to that african american young man who was working hard on 12\/19 at 1130 am.

quick tips:  maybe just get the basic waffles and basic fried chicken.

why?  the beauty of chicken and waffles is the yin\/yang balance of sweet\/yeasty with savory\/meaty.  the hot sauces--and the buffalo sauce are true to form in their spicy\/salty notes--but it's jhust too overwhelming.  in addition, the buffalo chicken version has a generous sprinkling of blue cheese.  while i appreciate the healthily big piece of chicken, it's just out of balance. there's just way too much salt in the sauce and too much cheese\/hot sauce overwhelming the balance. the waffle is lost--it's just basically an overshadowed flimsy carb, instead of a delightful, equal partner.

i won't say no to going here--but i'll just stick with the basic fried chicken\/waffle combo. i'm surprised that this place has such high reviews. i'd chalk this up to mostly novelty. 

also, last small note--i've read from others that the waffle fries are a big soggy. mine were acceptably not soggy.  it was interesting that my container of waffle fries was filled with tiny remnants--not a bad outcome as by volume, i had a lot more potato than if it had only been filled with full size pieces.

as usual--i felt a bit pressured to finish well within an hour to avoid paying parking fees at the NY NY garage. so i'm sorry--but minus half a star for making me worry about paying for parking in las vegas."	2	Bruxie	4.5
"i've been a big fan of guy savoy--i've been to the paris and las vegas restaurants several times. and it's always a highlight when the bread guy comes by with the huge assortment of breads.  so i was happy to try the brioche stand inside caesars.

overall--at 730 am, the banana\/nutella morning bun was stale. they did their best to heat it up to revive--but honestly, nothing beats the taste and overwhelming body reaction to fresh pastries. this was not one of those moments. even bouchon at the venetian is so much better than this. i am sad to admit that the donuts at America (inside NY NY) are far superior to this.

i've heard (though haven't confirmed) that the reason why the pastries taste stale are... because they ARE stale.  are they baked every morning or day? is there an oven pumping them out every 2-3 hours?  Try, maybe every 3 days I've heard.  That's why they have to revive them in the mini-oven.  Will you get a freshly baked pastry or a two day old one? If you like gambling in vegas, this is your bakery.  i am absolutely open to putting updated information here if someone from management can confirm that the pastries are baked throughout the day, or at least daily.  please tell me what time they enter the stand so i can go there and wait to buy fresh ones. 

the service people are nice enough but often not waiting around the register. i know it's boring to stand there--and there's work to be done behind those swaying doors. but i often wait around for 10-30 seconds waiting to see if the stand has been abandoned. when no one is there, it does look closed really.  

if i were guy savoy...i don't know if i'd feel good about this place with my name on it.  if you had really fresh pastries cycling in (like those humble donut stores in LA) throughout the day, then i'd be a huge fan and willing to put out the ""dough."" but i don't think they grill up a steak 2 days before at Guy Savoy and then reheat it for you when you order it today, right?

rule of thumb--if the pastries are good, there is usually a line. or constant turnover. there is no need to reheat fresh pastries.  there is hardly a line for this humble set up. if it were better, though, i'm sure there would be a line as the location is actually fairly convenient and the pastries sound\/look good. i want to like it--but for $10.22 for a coffee and a small pastry--it's a bit of a disappointment given the brand."	2	Brioche by Guy Savoy	2.5
"On yelp, it gets high scores and is open 24 hours--but last night, neither was true.  It was midnight--and before venturing forth from the warm hotel into the 40 degree temps, I tried to call ahead to make reservations or at least see how long the line was. Unfortunately, after ringing, the line went to audix voicemail--so no help there. It would have been nice to talk to anyone, because when I arrived, a host informed me the wait would be 20-25 minutes. I was the only people in line and plenty of empty tables--but the hostess said that only two servers showed up today--so they were not able to serve at a normal capacity.  

with so much distress going on for the customers and servers, it seemed unfortunate that:
1. no one picked up the phone to warn me that this would be a huge delay
2. that the hostess wasn't running around helping the servers. perhaps it's a union issue. but whatever it was, the restaurant was not functioning in a good way last night.

It sounds like a tough night--maybe a once off. But really, the next time I need a fun atmosphere, well run restaurant, or late night option, the last place I'd feel like trying is the hash house.  And that's unfortunate because it makes all the other hash restaurants look bad too.  

Next time, the Peppermill is super reliable, fun, and ---RELIABLE.  they pick up their phones and they let us know what's going on. Also Dupars, denny's, ihop, any other restaurant open 24 hours in any hotel that is not hidden on the second floor in the middle of the linq, etc.  with a location like this, more has to go right for Hash House for this to be worthy."	1	Hash House A Go Go	4
"I thought the pricing was the similar to genwa and khdb (the comedian's korean bbq place). maybe the quality was not quite as good--i had tiny bit more cartilage than i might get in LA. however, overall, it was very satisfying and also the quality of the panchan was very good. so you really can't go wrong here.

i would say however, the service was a bit lower than LA. the hostess has a tough job managing the long waits, but she does a great job.  

the servers though, while being efficient and team players, have these earpieces stuck deeply in their ears. someone from the kitchen speaks into their minds, like queen bee and their hive worker aliens if you ask any questions or have requests, they almost always have to ask you to repeat it and take their secret service ear pieces out.  i would not say it was the friendliest, most customer focused service--but it was efficient.  

one trivia fact: the uniforms they wear are what students wear in mandatory korean military i believe. it's not a cheetah print!  :) it's something a person who has spent time in korea or watched korean tv would recognize instantly."	4	Hobak Korean BBQ	4.5
"The steak was juicy but had a rim of tougher sinew--very fair for the price (about $6).  The pancake graveyard special (2 pancakes for $3) was not bad--the syrup and butter came in those sealed packets. The service was slow at 6 am but friendly.  No mobile cell signal that deep into the casino--nor is there wifi. So... best to watch ESPN over the counter or bring a book.

I thought the food was good for the price.  But overall for my steak and eggs (and pancakes) i'd rather go to Ellis Island still."	3	Sourdough Cafe	3.5
"i usually visit the restaurant on the other side of LV. but overall, everything was a bit off on the last visit. i wrote my review and someone from island flavor wrote back apologizing and asking me to come back as they had fixed some of the items i had mentioned!  that's a winning management--responsive.  i'll be happy to come back--really, how can i stay away?  :)  ok, now for the original review:

teri beef:  a solid bit too salty. and even though cut properly (against the grain), still tough.
macaroni salad: sadly, it was served super cold! couldn't taste it.  i think they need to turn that fridge down a few degrees! then again, if you're doing take out, that thing is the perfect temperature by the time you get home.
poke--was ok this visit. got the hawaii one with limu.

friendly service, lots of local people hanging out. i wish they could have someone bring them a BIB of the real strawberry flavored fruit punch from the islands instead of the tropicana version. i like the fanta syrup, but it's easy to get the big box at restaurant supply places--they're even near the airport. :)  i'd be happy to volunteer to bring you guys a box next time i have to bring checked luggage anyway. or maybe LV coke distributor can nab some for you guys. :)"	3	Island Flavor 	4.5
"disappointed that this turned out to be more about gimmicks than good food.  and at 4.5 stars, disappointingly overrated.  maybe 2-3 stars is more appropriate.

Breakfast Steak roll--got the veggie version of it.  the steak was tough, chewy. i should have read that many people thought it was ""chewy.""  Novel idea that tastes disappointing once you bite into it.

Pancakes--mediocre. a little bit tough and ""wheaty"" in taste. Not delicate or delightful unless you pile butter, fruit, anything on it.

Monte cristo benedict--once again, more about the gimmick than the taste.  I've had some great monte cristo's in the past--this was at the bottom.  The french toast was tough and the hollandaise sauce was seasoned with a paprika that was scented so strong with body odor, i thought it was cumin, not paprika.

I was sad that I drove out for this. Service was brusque but not very flexible."	2	Bite Breakfast & Lunch	4.5
"first off--great service. the staff is seasoned and friendly.  they take care of you.
nice setting. 

food surprisingly good. held to a caesars palace level of very good standards.
pancakes are not the best i've ever had, but they're pretty darn good. esp with the beautiful bottle of syrup. i went back and ordered it twice.  
not a big fan of the texture of their breakfast sausages, but bacon is reliable.

yes, it's hotel pricing. but overall, if i'm stuck in caesars, this is a decent option."	4	Cafe Americano	3.5
"other than hostess, a nice experience with typical las vegas pricing.

server: ariel--top notch. food runners, bar staff--all great.  hostess at the one moment--just ok--she told us over the phone there was no wait, 5 minutes later downstairs from our rooms, there was a wait. but not because of a lack of tables--but balancing the waitresses. she tells us to sit down in the bar and wait for 10-15 min there. then 20 minutes later, she never gets us. we go to the stand, and she seats us right away. hmm. not great a great start--we almost left based on that alone. but the regular servers made up for it big time.

teriyaki burger--the best. all the burgers have a good bun.
nom nom burger-- a sad plain second. esp compared to the teri burger.
both burgers cooked just like we ordered--medium rare. well done, kitchen chefs!
fries--good. nice they come included for the price
potato chips--for $1 more, they were great as a side
chocolate shake excellent

overall, a bit salty as usual. and expensive.  i think nowadays i'll head to the shake shack for a good burger\/shake\/fries. but holstein's not a bad choice and the alcoholic milkshakes are fun here.

from my last visit 5 years ago, i do miss the bulgogi burger."	4	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4
"The poke was not too bad. It could have used a bit more sesame oil and shoyu to up the moisture\/unctuous level. The texture was firm--I wish it were a bit softer.  The one with mayo was not quite as fresh as the main one (shoyu).  

I did like that it was a generous portion--and at the right prices. Service was nice but not overly friendly at the one time I went at lunch.  But overall I appreciated getting a dose of poke in las vegas. There is no tables inside, but outside there is one stone round table that is nicely placed outside the poke place.

I parked on the street right outside--that seemed easiest."	3	Hawaiian Style Poke	4
"update from the opening:  as usual--visited romaine empire--the prices remain a tad high. but the salads are good.  top notch cobb for $13.51.  

major deduction of stars for the chicken caesar wrap (11.85 with tax). it was a sad experience. if i ever get it again, next time i will ask for it to be freshly made, because the lettuce inside was brown and wilted. the MAIN reason i go to romaine empire is because of garde manger excellence--the lettuce is usually treated well. but in my experience tonight, the chicken caesar wrap i got was from the oldest part of their pile and filled with brown lettuce.  and also measly chicken--way less overall food than the simple three topping salad. don't get the wraps--stick with the freshly made salads instead where the lettuce is actually fresh and turned over.

to go from 4 stars to 5--simply make the prices slightly lower. For me, a 3 topping salad should be $11 (tax included).  i used to come here three times a trip back when it was romaine way across the food court. now it's down to a one visit per trip. i'd say tripling sales for $1 less per guest check would be a no brainer. perhaps compare the volumes of when it was in the location across the food court to where it is now.

lastly, one one weird thing is the acoustics when ordering.  it's near impossible to hear anything the workers say--although they can hear us fine.  must be the glass shielding the salad or the air conditioning pattern right there. but please someone test it out--it makes it easier if we can hear what they have to say when taking our customized salad order. i always need to ask them to repeat their questions\/comments, etc"	3	Romaine Empire	3.5
"Worth a return?  No
Worth a 30 minute drive? No, especially with rare free parking in that area. 
Worth a flight?  Nope.  Fly to the LA Du-Pars instead--that's worth a flight!
Favorite:  Shrimp Cocktail for $3.99

First, if you're wondering if the pancakes here are as good as legend... While these LV pancakes are reminiscent of LA's, for some reason they lack the magic.  It's not quite as fluffy and there isn't enough tang\/salt?  And according to Yelp reviews, the pancakes are the second best thing in the restaurant.

Interestingly, the best thing on the menu is not even listed there:  the $3.99 shrimp cocktail.  That was succulent, fresh, and I personally liked the cocktail sauce.  You won't find it better elsewhere.

Due to current street renovations, it's hard to find free parking.  You can probably find one at one of the hotels, but the cashier advised me to tip a valet $2.  It's preferable to paying the same amount to the parking garage.

Service was friendly enough.  Coffee was farmers (which I like--it's standard American diner coffee) and served exceptionally fresh.  If only the pancakes had been worthy of the coffee..."	3	Du-Par's	4
"It's a tiny bit expensive, but reliable.  FYI, Di Fara tastes dramatically better and different than this.  So don't judge Di Fara based on this.  Go to Brooklyn, make a trip out of it. It's eccentric and old school--and so worth it.  

Having tasted the real thing and having such fond memories of the Brooklyn shop--it is a bit hard to look at this without resentment. But if I ignore the name, the pizza is reliable and only slightly overpriced in the way one would expect for Caesar's food court."	3	Di Fara Pizza	2.5
Overall, pretty mediocre. I enjoyed the breakfast and it's a cheap alternative and a great way to fill up for a long day of sight-seeing (or gambling!) However, the lunch and dinner left me wanting more.	3	MGM Grand Buffet	2.5
Love love love FUKU BURGER so much ...it was Awesome met colin he was Soo nice friendly...we never even made it to try Fatburger which was just near our hotel we couldn't stay away from The Fuku...love your Htown...buds.	5	Fukuburger Truck	4
Hung out at Fuku on Saturday and Sunday talked with Colin he's cool guy....BEST BURGER HANDS DOWN...never mad it to Fatburger,  and don't care....Fuku BURGER  with those amazing fries...loved it...from ur TX buds....	5	Fuku Burger	4
"Here's the thing; love the friendly staff, produce is eclectic, prices on meats\/ wines are unmatched, they offer food and wine pairings every now and then, donuts are AMAZING, BOH staff will ask if there's anything we would like to see in the store,  and 90% of the time they can get it ! So why 1 star?  
I CAN NOT overlook the fact that they are ok with letting dogs in. Little dogs on leashes, big dogs that the 93 lb handler could bearly handle, people carrying dogs....UGH the list goes on !  
Dogs shed, puppies pee when they're  excited and due to panting...THEY SLOBBER all over the open produce and baskets!! I've  been shopping here for the past 3 years cuz I can get great things without running all over and paying a little extra.  Every now and then we would see a dog in your store and YES we would complain but last night was the last straw...3 dogs in less than an hour...PAU! That's too many and that's just from what we've  seen. Security should stop them BEFORE a customer complains, not after.  So, you guys just lost 1 Hawaii family"	1	Glazier's Food Marketplace	3.5
This is where I git my shoyu poke on!! My only concern is, no ogo da poke...but that's ok, I usually have a stash so I add, let rest then eat. My Hawaii taste is simple yet flavorful, don't  care for most poke bars AND I git a 1 stop shop...poi kulolo, slippah, bread, poke...pau!	4	Island Flavor	4.5
"Staff is very cool....they make sure you have what you need, it is a self serve restaurant, and are willing to help you out.  
Decent street style tacos. My fave are the fajita chicken and the brisket tacos  covered with (not really ) butt burning sauce. Nachos are ok but im not a fan of the cheese. Their salads are no joke sized and flavorful but my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE item they got...lilikoi margarita, on Tha rocks  During the cooler months I'll  sit outside, sip this and think of HI. Always puts a smile on my face"	4	Fuzzy's Taco Shop	3.5
"Love going to this place post workout LOL! Get my protein on 
Waitstaff is informative on the menu, dressed in PJ's, they are still moving like they're  not asleep 
Juices taste fresh, great flavor. Food is simply amazing. Hubby ordered chilaquilles, looked so good I had to take a chip....even their chips were marinated in poblano sauce and seasoning! Who does that ?!?!? They do and it adds a whole new\/amazing taste experience
My eggs benni hit the spot...with the addition  of avocado,tomato, spinach and hash browns...so so ono!!
A little on the pricey side but every once on a while, that's ok"	4	Rise & Shine a Steak & Egg Place	4
"Staff was pleasant, we told them it was our first time, while stating this I was eyeing their salads and slaw. The girl behind the counter asked if there's  anything I want to try, she'll  let me have a taste. I should've  taken her up on it cuz the pineapple\/coconut slaw sounded and looked amazing, same with the chicken salad
I ordered the pastrami sandwich with sidewinder fries which  was so tasty! Plump, crispy fries, sandwich was served on mixed rye bread with coleslaw in the sandwich. That trio gave the sandwich an amazing dimension of flavor!
My son had the 3 cheese grilled cheese sandwich  on Texas  toast, which was good.
My husband had the baby back ribs with Mac n cheese. He ordered sauce on the side but it still came on top and the ribs tasted old, meat pulled away from the bone and the bone was dried out. We lived in TX for 14 years and bbq is one of our faves, so we know when some things up. 
PLUS it took 20 minutes for our food to come out, not sure why but it did.
There are still a few  sandwiches we would like to try, so yeah we'll  be back"	4	Chip Off The Block Deli	4
"I've never been much of a buffet person. I KNOW RIGHT?? I  just dont take in food like i used to.. I'd just be a waste. 

BUT this place is worth it. Very tapas sytle dining. And i think next time I'm gonna add that $10 for bloody mary's or mimosas. It's Vegas! And i love em! 

Best thing hands down when I went was the salmon over a bed of risotto. AND their chocolate lava cake with cookies and creme GELATO. GELATO! Who has that?? THIS wicked place does. LOVED IT! 

It's a comebacker!"	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"THIS IS A MUST STOP WHENEVER I'm IN VEGAS.

4 words: ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE. 

Sure I can easily make this at home. But something about the dish that just isnt the same if I was to make it at home. It's actually good here! 

Everything else is pretty good too. I've had their tapsilog, saimin, longsilog. All good but again 4 words: ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE. Geeeeet it!"	4	Aloha Kitchen & Bar	3.5
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant. 

I'm probably a sucker for it because my family had a special dinner there for my dad the first time I was there and everything was just PERFECT. The pinot noir bottle that my boyfriend had bought was smooth, light, and delicious with dinner. The bartender had suggested it and it was excellent- she was highly knowledgeable. 

We had escargot for appetizer- my first time and loved it!

Lobster and steak was cooked to perfection, savory, buttery, and all that healthy stuff. ;p

BUT the view.. the view was so nice. We were front and center outdoor patio where you caught the water show at the Bellagio every 15 mintues. I LOVED it. It was a free show with dinner!

The only reason I didnt give it a 5 star was because yelp doesn't do half stars and the second time I came was with my boyfriend and we were stuck in the way back. I was able to see the show but unfortunately was not able to watch it with him. It's a hit or miss when you get seated here. But the view of the water show does make the difference for me. 

FOOD is YUM. Thats a 5 star all the way.  Scallops and bone in rib-eye. BOMB!

Have not been here for brunch or lunch but have heard delectable things!"	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"One of THEEEE best sandwich places EVER... ONLY reason why its a 4 over a 5 (they really DO need half stars) is because of the line. It is ALWAYS long. ALWAYS. But that only says how good the place is. 

Anyway, I've only had the pleasure of having the Full Montague which is like this massive club deliciousnesss smashed into one sandwich. Turkey, roast beef, ham maybe?, mustard aioli, and all the fixins... love it!!

And with all the price hikes now a days, can't beat a 7$ sandwich made to last all night. And if it doesn't, it's open 24 hours now!"	4	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE... thats all you need to know. ;)	4	Aloha Kitchen	4
"Okay.. I may be slightly on the generous side but the food just totally won me over! 

Went to Vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party and decided to go here for our bachelorette dinner! 

AMBIANCE- 4 stars!
FOOD- 5 stars!
SERVICE- 5 stars!

Ambiance was nice and simple, very open and modern. Hard to give it a 5 star because my other favorite restaurant Mon Ami Gabi over at Paris is hard to top. But this was a very schnazzy and fun place to have dinner. 

The food can't even compete! Because it was pool day the next day, my friend and i decided to split the clam linguine. Which seriously was sooo good. Everyone else's was drool on myself good as well! The grilled chicken, chicken carbonara, and the rib eye steak that I got to taste from each of my friends plate made me wish there was an entree sampler... which I could have ALL TO MYSELF! Loved  everything!

Service was great! Waiters and waitresses were accomodating and very friendly! For the bachelorette party, we had a scavenger hunt going where we had to find certain guys to pose or do certain things and all of them were ethusiastic and completely on board. One guy was all about it and even went the extra mile. (Thought to myself: okay dude, thanks but realllly thanks now ok? lol)


Overall, loved the food and will definitely be back to share the experience with more people!"	5	Cucina by Wolfgang Puck	4
We have been big fans of Giada for years & were super excited to try her first ever restaurante.  Ok first for the positives,  great atmosphere,  beautiful place. Now the food, amazing,  just as we thought it would be, but i must say they love their arugula lol. Now the negatives,  the service was lacking, we found ourselves waiting looking around for service. Drinks were forgotten,  no refills offered & when we did get the bill, not only did they charge us for our table but also added someone else's table to our bill. So overall,  great food but the service is what brings you back, and unfortunately,  the service did not compliment the food, so not sure if we would return. Our grade would be a B-, C+.	3	Giada	3.5
Just went for drinks with the girls.  The bartenders are nice and friendly.  Great service.  Lots of televisions.  Watched the Rousey fight there.  Great music videos when the fights were over.  Fun place to just hang out.  Definitely recommend it.  I hear the food is good as well but I didn't try it.	5	Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery	3
"This place was really cool.  It has a mechanical bull and great decor, with a southwest sugar skull day of the dead type theme.  We had initially gone just to have a few drinks but decided to order dinner while we there as well.

We had actually stumbled upon it trying to see if the Linq was up and running yet, but we are glad we found it.  The food is tapas style and I definitely recommend the Lobster Taco's and the Sope's.  Both were delicious.  Their drinks pretty good too.  The waitresses and female bartenders have a whole lot of cleavage hanging out which is fine unless you have young kids, but really it wouldn't even hit the Richter Scale of things you don't want your kids to see if you have them on the Las Vegas strip anyways.  Call me conservative.  Very pretty girls though.

If you are going up the stairs to use the bathroom, be sure to check out all the sombrero's on the wall in the staircase.  Very cool.  I loved the decor.  I wished there was more people there and that the mechanical bull was going when we were there but I think we caught them seriously a few days after they opened.  

I will definitely be going back and taking friends there while they are in town."	5	Chayo Mexican Kitchen + Tequila Bar	3
"So delicious!

The wait staff there is very knowledgeable about the food and the cooking process and you get five star service.  

This place is a dream for foodies.  Seriously, if you are a foodie and you don't go here while in Vegas you are missing out.

Its fairly expensive but definitely worth the experience.  The food is really a work of art and so delicious."	5	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
"Great food and a casual atmosphere.

The food is good.  I recommend the brisket nachos.  They are delicious.  

There are lots of TV's and it is open to the hotel and casino floor.  Great place to grub.  I have never had to wait for a table there."	5	BLT Burger	3.5
Really good barbeque food.  Really casual atmosphere, you order at the counter and they have it ready pretty quickly.  Customer service wasn't on point, but everyone has a bad day, so don't let it stop you.  The portions are good and you can pick your own seat.  Would do it again anytime I'm nearby.	4	Big Ern's BBQ	3.5
Food was good.  I had the Kale Salad with Blackened Chicken, and a side of Sweet Potato Fries.  The price is really good for The Strip.  The service was kind of slow, and there weren't a lot of people in there.  I was actually surprised that the service was slow because they surely deal with much larger crowd than the several tables that were in there at the time.  Other than that, no complaints at all.  Would go back.	4	I Love Burgers	3
"My sisters and I came here for Super Bowl Sunday.  It was $100.00 per person to get in, unlimited food and drinks.  The food was delicious.  I didn't drink but my sister's did and said the drinks were good.  The decor is nice, the workers uniforms are ridiculous, lol, I felt bad for them, but it is a very English look.  

The big bonus to this was though that on occasion Gordon Ramsey himself comes in to check on things, and at the time we were there so was he.  My sister is a big foodie and we were stoked that she got to get a picture with him.  He is very nice and personable in person although I didn't get too close because I couldn't get past my terror and PTSD of watching him scream at people on TV.  lol.

Overall it is a great place.  I'd definitely go back both for the Super Bowl, or just for dinner or lunch."	5	Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill	3.5
"By far the best buffet I have ever been to!

I'm not kidding or sugar-coating.  It was so good.  I recommend their meatloaf.  The sauce on it was amazing.  The whole buffet really is amazing.  I also recommend the ceviche and the desserts are to die for.

There is generally a bit of a line, like most buffets, but it moves fast.  Its a little expensive, I think like 40 bucks a person, but for what you get it is well worth it.  I make a point to take my family here every time they are in town.

The decor is beautiful, as is all the decor in the Wynn."	5	The Buffet	3.5
"This place is pretty cool.  The giant praying mantis outside is neat to look at, and the atmosphere is great.  I wish they had more stores in the park, but I will say when I went to visit it, it had just opened.

One thing that kind of made me crazy though was that the flooring for the upstairs walkway is see-through, and you have to kind of mentally prepare yourself and reassure yourself you wont fall through.  It is very sturdy, but the mental thing is does to you is distracting.  lol.

They always have live bands playing here and its walking distance to Fremont Street.  Parking was easy.  I really enjoyed it and will be back next time I am over in that area.

Great place to take kids, there is a giant play area right in the middle of it."	5	Downtown Container Park	4
The Pho is really good here.  I love the little cart on the table with all the equipment you need including sriracha and what I think is eel sauce?  They are really quick, you order and they bring it out within minutes.  The size large is super large though!  The decor is odd, but not bad for a Mom and Pop Shop atmosphere.  It is pretty cheap too, I think I spent $11.00 on mine for a large bowl and water to drink.  I really loved the fresh basil leaves, it was delicious.	5	Pho Saigon 8	3.5
The food here is good.  I got the Gold Standard Burger and would recommend it.  They have gluten-free buns and will make it protien style, with a lettuce wrap instead of bun.  They also have Sweet Potato Fries which is good for Paleo people.  The service at the bar is really good, both bartenders were on point.  The music is a little loud for my taste, but I don't think it would bother anyone else.  The shakes and the cocktails looked really good, although I didn't try any of them.  The price is really reasonable by Strip standards.  Will definitely be going back.	5	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4
"The Sugar Factory is really good.  I was initially hesitant because I thought it was going to be a ton of sugary food, but it is actually a great restaurant with delicious food.  The people with me had Cheeseburgers which tasted amazing and I had the French Dip Sandwich, also which was really good.  It is beautiful at night because you can see the water show at the Bellagio across the street. 

They have these amazing, and giant drinks which are colorful and sugary and full of alcohol.  I didn't try one, but if they taste as good as they look, I would say that it is a must do while in Vegas.  I also love the dark atmosphere of the restaurant. 

It is attached to the actual candy store which was fun to look through afterwards, they have a lot of hard to find candy and vintage stuff.  Pretty cool place.  I wouldn't write it off if you aren't into sugar, as I am not, but it was still worth going to.  I will definitely be going back at some point."	5	Sugar Factory American Brasserie	3
"This is a chain, and I initially found it in California and then when I saw it here in Summerlin I knew I was in luck.  They have very good sushi, and although it is not part of the restaurant, my favorite thing about Tivoli Village is that while I am eating scrumptious sushi, the valet will clean my car for me inside and out. Anyways, back to Kabuki.

Always good food here, elegant atmosphere.  I recommend the Hawaiian Roll and the Salmon Skin roll.  Both are great."	5	Kabuki Japanese Restaurant	4
I personally wouldn't recommend this.  It is really expensive, and you initially think it is not until they tell you that they are Tapas style servings of the food, and even then it is not really enough to feed people.  I thought it was really overpriced and didnt think the food was that good.  I had a sushi roll and it was just mediocre and cost around 30.00.  I think that with all the restaurants on the Strip, you would be better off skipping this place.	1	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
Really good for people with diet restrictions or food allergies.  They have healthy shakes and they also juice there.  The Jicama fries are different but very good.  I like that you can build your own meal by choosing your meat and vegetable.  The decor is pretty cool as well.  You order at the counter and they bring it out to you, very laid back environment.  It is in the same lot as Las Vegas Athletic Club, so there are a lot of people in there juicing or getting shakes after working out.  Cool environment.	4	Greens and Proteins	4
So good.  A little expensive for the food court, but seriously the best lobster sandwich I've ever had.  People rave about the Lobsicle as well but it was really late when we got there and they were all out.  I would say you must try it if you are in the Venetian.	5	Lobster ME	3.5
Pretty good Poke.  I like that you can order several different kinds in smaller containers as oppose to only getting one larger portion.  It's a little weird, there are three different restaurants all in one shared area.  There is a sushi place and a hawaiian BBQ place.  It's cool if you have people who don't want the same thing as you.  Very casual atmosphere where you order at the counter.  Many different kinds of poke to chose from.  Would go there again.  I went to the other hawaiian place across from LVAC in that shopping center, and Poke Express is much better in my opinion.	4	Poke Express	4.5
This place is really cool.  I actually didn't know what it was and has passed it several times before.  It is a really large concert venue and bowling alley with a patio area which was cool for smokers.  I didn't get any food or drinks, but drink are drinks.  They have a live band and a lot of people dancing and having a good time.  Cool decor and atmosphere.	5	Brooklyn Bowl	3.5
Clean and nice atmosphere.  The food is good quality.  Much better than the local Station Casino Buffets.  They have pretty decent fried oysters and their seafood is good, which is a big chance at a buffet, but this was good.  Like their dessert options.  Stuff is marked Gluten-Free which is good to know since I don't do gluten.  I would go back.	5	Seasons Buffet	3.5
"We own at Tahiti Village, so it was natural to check this out.  
The food was OK.  It's definitely a plus to have the endless tapas or cocktails, even if the individual items aren't something to rave about.
If you're in the area and looking for something simple, I'd recommend it."	3	Tahiti Joe's	2.5
Expensive Gelato, but HUGE selection & very creamy & delicious. Excellent cappuccino's . Quick service. Excellent location . In-between the Palazzo & Venetian by the waterfall.HeathBar Crunch!!!! WOW!	5	Espressamente illy	3.5
Descent Mexican food. Not bad but no so wonderful. Sorry was very friendly but painless slow. The place was empty in a Tuesday night but they would hold us a table with a reservation? They push alcoholic drinks... Careful....chicken fajitas were standard fare...chicken mole was a bit sub par but very edible. Friend got chili relleno but complained it tasted of fish? Oh well, we will skip this in the future, but the location is good & atmosphere is fun.... Good modern hipster music.	3	Casa Don Juan  - Downtown	4

"In peu de Paris en Vegas...Viva France
The view from this outside patio area is one of the most fabulous in VEGAS IF you are into the STRIP!
And I am.
We were there during the day.
I am sure the nighttime view is beyond amazing considering you are directly across from the fountains from the Bellagio...
Not possible to make reservations for the patio
First come first seated.
go at an off time, sign up and YES you can wait just outside the front doors and the ""buzzer"" still works, even though they say it doesn't...
I loved the mussels with the fries, and the huge French Onion Soup with melted cheese.
My GF had the Salmon Salad, perfect.
Not cheap, but well worth the quality food, good service and magnificent view"	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
The server barely spoke English but understood about 15%. He could not answer any question right?? ALL OUR DISHES CAME OUT @ the same time:Salad,Soup & main dish!!! Obviously, our soup & entree got cold, no server to be found. When I asked 1 server for a plate to cover my dishes, it never came. Food was good. Fresh spring rolls were just lettuce and thin slice of tofu, no shrimp? Soup BOWL is huge, Tom Kahn Gai. Chicken basil entree was awkward as it was minced? I don't know what was inside???? Is there a band tonight ? He didn't understand the question even though I pointed to the music area??? Weird???	2	Krung Siam Thai	3.5

expensive
they do have a happy hour.
The portions are smaller to compensate for the lower price.
We will still ok with that.
Next to the Mandalay Bay Hotel Convention Center where we were attending an event, so the convenience factor was super high
we got a pair of rolls that were $5 each at happy hour consisting of 4 pieces each... and a plate of edamame for $5..."	4	China Grill	3.5
"Sweet corn chowder pretty good,( I would have liked it better with WHITE MEAT not dark meat, that's just me)
Ordered Kung Pao Shrimp, but they brought us CHICKEN? We took it, & it was still yummy. And the best part was the Chilean Sea Bass steamed with bean sauce but hmmmm it had bones? Never ever had my Real Chilean sea bass WITH BONES? But the flavor was buttery & creamy and we could NOT stop eating it EVEN after we were full!!!
WE WILL 4 SURE BE BACK!!!

"Definitely not suitable for networking events .
Attended event there , which they had double booked the space. They tried moving us to an unsuitable part of the restaurant . The GM never apologized for the double booking blaming it on the staff who never communicated it ....really you expect us to believe that ? 
I have no idea how the food or drinks were as after an hour no one had come offering anything . I got hungry so went next door to get something . 
As a networking event organizer myself, I would never use this venue. Not upset about the double booking, although that is bad in itself, more upset about how they handled the situation."	1	Hearthstone Kitchen & Cellar	4
This is an excellent restaurants. I have held business networking events and laurie is always helpful and fantastic. This is a great venue for your events.	5	Brentwood Cafe & Tavern	3.5
"Great food. Crappy service. Had to wait 10 minutes to get seated simply because they were understaffed on boxing day.  They had 8 open tables and yet no one to seat , no one at cash register. A few servers were serving those that were lucky enough to get seated, but no one available to seat people coming in. We left with extreme prejudice....previous experiences tell me food is good, but the service has never been up to par but today was particularly bad.

However the owner responded professionally to my complaint and with past experiences I have decided to change my rating from a 2* to 5*. I will be going back and will assume this is a one off experience as previous experiences have been good. Service not perfect, but still better than a lot of places I have visited.
I also respect professional responses."	5	IHOP	2.5

Catherine is an attentive hostess, and always makes you feel welcome.  I
don't think I've ever heard anyone describe food quite like she does!  Jose is a very talented Chef.
We have One negative;  those wooden chairs are so darn uncomfortable! We certainly don't feel like lingering over our meal. 
Sad to admit, but we have taken to patronizing other local restaurants because we find those hard wooden chairs make for an unpleasant meal."	3	Elements Fine Casual Dining & Cocktails	4
"Folks, I've reviewed this restaurant once before, and this is an addendum;  

This is a wonderful little Italian restaurant and apparently a secret to many. Please,  Spread the word ... we need to support the small restaurant owners.

WHY frequent the mass produced corporate owned eateries that proliferate the Vegas Valley when we have in our backyard this independently owned, and lovingly operated jewel?  

We try to always support the smaller, family owned & run eateries and find that we are infrequently disappointed.  Gina's Tops our List !!

Last night we dined on steaming bowls of the most delicious Pasta Fagioli I've ever had, it was served with a basket of warm & wonderfully crusty Italian bread (a new bread to Ginas).  We chose a lovely bottle of Sangiovese Puglia, an Italian Red wine that Vince suggested.  A PERFECT meal for a cold evening.  

Gina's well deserves one visit by you....because you'll be hooked!"	4	Gina's Bistro	4.5
"We have been here for lunch and dinner recently, each time hoping we have found a 'keeper' on our Restaurant List, sadly at this point that is not the case.
Most recently we dined there Friday night, the restaurant was quite busy, something  the staff was unprepared to handle.  A sudden influx of customers can understandably slow down service; however when we made our reservation we took the last remaining spot available for that hour.  They should have prepared accordingly.  Our biggest disappointment came from the wait staff.  Service was exceedingly slow, discombobulated, cumbersome at best.  Our table was wobbly, a request for the wine list took at least 15 minutes, then we had to ask again.  We were served our plates from the wrong side, the waiter reaching across the table to serve, they did not get one course served to the correct person.  It appeared as if it were a new restaurant  opening, unprepared and understaffed.  On the service side, one of their saving graces may be the recent addition of some of the staff from the recently closed Rosemary's, where service was always impeccable. 

Additionally, the choice of music that was piped in the background, was not dinner appropriate unless you are under 30 years old. 

Garfields certainly is a lovely restaurant, nautical theme with a fabulous location.  Sadly, we have not experienced eating anything particularly  memorable there, with the exception of the bread.  Plus, we found the menu sorely lacking in variety, nothing jumps out at you, it's all pretty ordinary fare.    

With Marche Bacchus, one of the best 'off the Strip' restaurants literally a few steps away, Garfields has formidable competition.  Lets hope they can  pick up their game, and find their niche to keep people coming back. We were quite disappointed"	2	Garfield's Restaurant	3
So hadn't stayed at NYNY for a year.there 7\/2\/16 for Garth Brooks. Went to ilFonaio with friends as always loved it before. The food was terrible!!! Ceasar salad was served with BROWN lettuce! Canalonie was stuffed with something that was supposed to be Chicken, think it was canned! Friends ravilloi resembled something like ravioli covered with canned tomatoes. The bill for 4 was over $85.00 and was not worth $$$$$ go somewhere else for a better italian meal this IS NOT ITALIAN FOOD,	1	Il Fornaio	3.5
This is officially my go to spot when I'm craving Filipino food! It's close to home and decently priced. I ordered crispy pata, pork adobo, and lumpia and it was all good! serving size was also perfect. I will be definitely coming back to try the other dishes.	5	Tina's Filipino Cuisine	4
After coming back from Hawaii, I was craving some fresh poke so I decided to give this place a try. I ordered the bowl with salmon and ahi with mixed greens and it was DELICIOUS! The server suggested the shoyu sauce and it was perfect! The salmon and ahi were really fresh :) Servers were great! Definitely will be going back more often since it's conveniently located near me :)	5	Ted's Sushi Burrito	4.5
Under new management\/ownership. Definitely no longer a gem. Too bad too. This place was quite good. Salad no taste and served in a 12 oz. clear plastic cup. Sandwich made on bread that resembles the banana nut bread that my grandparents used to make.  It is edible at least, but it's not for sandwiches.  Side of vegetables soaked in jalapeno juice. Quite a surprise when biting into a carrot or cauliflower invokes the sensation of being in a raw jalapeno eating contest. I like spicy flavorful dishes, but want to know ahead of time, rather than being surprised with a mouthful of fire.  Menu greatly reduced, almost no menu at all. Only serve one sandwich and one salad. No more wraps or anything else.  Bottom line: The food is terrible. There is no choice to speak of on the menu. This is a place to avoid.	1	Keep Memory Alive Cafe	3.5
I've been to Roy's in HI, FL, CA and NV and they always consistently hit the mark.  I was here last week which happened to coincide with my birthday and the extra attention they gave was awesome, from the custom birthday insert in the menu, a photo of the occasion and a little dessert surprise. 5 Stars all the way!  The Hawaiian Martini is always a favorite.  All the food was great, the dressing on the pear salad was a little too tart, but not worth a ding on the review.	5	Roy's Restaurant	4.5
I went to this club with a friend and I am sorry to say it was less than mediocre. There are so many good strip clubs in Vegas but dont make the mistake of going here. P.S. dont get a lap dance from Morgan she took my money and never saw her again.	1	Treasures Gentlemen's Club	3
I'd have loved to give them a 4 or 5 star but just went to have their breakfast buffet I always look forward to getting upon arrival to Vegas and was greatly disappointed. No more Portuguese Sausage or Pork links and quality of the food has gone down greatly. Even bacon was soggy not crispy as I remembered it. Used to also come with toast and now it diesnt. I was so disappointed to bite into the sausage to realize it was kelbasa. I do still love their Midnight Graveyard Special so I'll leave it at 3 stars. Hoping I won't be disappointed when I go for that at least, another tradition when I come to Vegas.	3	Market Street Cafe	3.5
"Honestly the best dinner I had in Vegas considering all the great restaurants in town.  I was in town for business and tired of eating on the strip, so 3 of my colleagues and I got this recommendation from a cocktail waitress at Aria... thanks Thea!

Local spot off the strip, great atmosphere, great service, and even better food.  We had to wait about 45 for a table, but definitely worth it and drinks helped kill the time.  

I had the Chicken Marsala... excellent.  Someone else got ""Crazy"" Alfredo... super good and very popular dish.  Seriously, anything you order there would be good.  I would recommend this place to anyone and can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
Excellent job Nora's... keep it up!"	5	Nora's Italian Cuisine	4
We had a great dinner here. This was by far our favorite meal of the trip and very reasonably priced for being on the strip! Be sure to request a table in their front area with the windows that overlooks the Bellagio fountain. Such a cute atmosphere, great service, and the food was great! The French Onion soup was great as well as the steak frites with a red wine reduction. This is definitely a place I would return to on another trip!	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
Great people. Great food. Love the array of salads. They even took our picture to put on their Facebook page.	5	Osi's Kitchen	4.5
This is my go to brunch when I go to Las Vegas. The banana muffin is moist, great food, good portion for a reasonable price.	5	Egg & I	4.5
Very authentic Thai cuisine. Best meal my husband and I had in Vegas during our trip. They don't take short cuts in making the food. The waitstaff was very friendly. The owner came out and talked to us. I highly recommend this place.	5	Kinthai	4.5
Crinkle bacon fries are yummy. Got the Smokestack burger - the bacon wasn't cooked enough so when I took that off, the burger was good. Some of the tables are so close together that it's hard to get in and out of the table. Amd the accoustics suck. Between the music and the crowd, its kinda loud. Mostly a good experience but definitely room to approve.	3	Shake Shack	4
This place is the bomb, and their quick too - super fast, super fast! We ordered by pointing at yelp photos ...	5	Sakana	4

"Fake Brazil restaurant

Esse restaurante com certeza não é brasileiro. 
Primeiro que ninguém fala português. Segundo que pela decoração da para ver que uma versão americana do Brasil, com quadros fora da nossa realidade e música de elevador.
A comida também é horrível. O arroz era doce, a feijoada era apenas feijão preto e o churrasco também não era brasileiro, quando não estava queimado estava cru.
No final de tudo isso desisti de experimentar a caipirinha e ainda passei mal com a comida.
Lamentável. Não recomendo."	1	Pampas Churrascaria Brazilian Grille	3
I was here in January during CES and it was wonderful. The local beer was tasty, the spiked milkshake was to die for and the burgers were fantastic. Our server was very genuine with his service making it an excellent experience. I'm only giving it 4 starts because I got some serious nausea from either the egg on my burger or the fried oysters. However, I'd still eat here again after that...that is how good this place is.	4	B&B Burger & Beer	3
My family and I recently stayed at Treasure Island, the breakfast brunch and dinner buffet is not worth it.  My kids wasn't fond of their bland food. The prime rib at the dinner buffet was the only good thing, the crab legs wasn't even as tasty as we would like.  On top of that, it is very difficult to get a server to help you when you needed ketchup, steak sauce, napkins & etc.  My daughter ended up not feeling well after our breakfast and dinner buffet saturday until today which is Monday.  Next time, we will look into visiting a vegas buffet that is fulfilling and worth our money.	2	The Buffet At TI	2.5
This place is sucks ..  I will never come here again poor customer service. ..Manger is an ass hole I just had surgery. .. sitting where it's 105 no mister nothing ..he was going to make us wait another 45 min just to get an inside table .. . Don't come here again	1	Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar	3.5
I'm from LA and everytime I visit Vegas I go here...I love this ayce made to order sushi place! Sushi is so FRESH and Rolls are so TASTY & many choices! I go here w\/ lose clothing so I can fit more in my belly. I always leave HAPPY :)	5	Sushi Mon	3.5
I love POKkkkEeeee!!!! Every since I left Hawaii I thought I'll never get to eat good POKE...But nOw i found it! I'm from LA but I will make my visit to get some POKE. I didn't know POKE can be so addicting! They have different kind of POKe...Must try! I heard the other location have more choices. I'm gonna try that place next time.	5	Poke Express	4.5
A great place to get away from the Las Vegas Strip!!!!	5	Mt. Charleston Lodge	3.5
This place has a cute atmosphere with nice wall decors and Hawaiian music.  The staff were mellow.  The red velvet pancakes were really delicious - not too sweet,  not too thick,  chocolate powder layered over, nice light fluffy whipped cream, and sweet sugar glazed syrup.  I had side fruits - too much mushy cantaloupe.  I am looking forward to come back to try other things.	4	BabyStacks Cafe	4
Love their firecracker bowl its always enough food and they customize the vegetables how i like it!	5	Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill	3.5
This was ok, not great and not terrible.  I came in around 1030 pm and it was still very busy.  Of course, it's Vegas and the MGM casino area.  The burger and fries were decent, needed seasoning.  The guy bartender was friendly and the girl bartender was like " can I get you a drink, will you be dining with us, model runway turn, and she says the same thing to the next guy.  How about some originality.  Speak like a human not a robot.  The bar wasn't busy, just the dining room.  Ketel one up was good but I asked for it ice cold and three olives.  I got Luke warm and two olives.  Not a huge deal but it shows a lack of attention to detail or maybe a lack of caring when somebody asks for something from a bartender or server.  Won't be back anytime soon.	3	Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill Las Vegas	4
This is middle of the road good.  Service is sparse and slow but you do get the food.  Bacon and eggs, hash browns, English muffin, OJ and berry bowl.  The bacon was average and everything else was fine but not spectacular.  Eat breakfast at The Hotel or Wynn and it's much better.  Bellagio too.	3	24 Seven Cafe	3
Been here probably 10 times and typically it's pretty good.  Never great but never bad.  The server I had this morning was a nice guy but brought the food out all at the same time.  I ordered a bowl a berries, eggs w\/ ham hashbrowns and English muffin, and coffee.  Basically received everything at the same time.  Most other servers give you the coffee, then the fruit, then food.  I got the coffee and quickly after everything else.  I know it's not the end of the world but it's common sense.  For what you pay for breakfast here it should be pretty right on.  What, maybe 45 bucks for one person.  The food is good, particularly the ham.  It's convenient and a nice place but it is a typical hotel restaurant.	3	THEcafe at THEhotel	3.5
Look in Vegas there are tons of great restaurants.  I wouldn't say this place is great and it is overpriced.  However, the steaks are quite good.  The service is a bit inconsistent but again not terrible.  Aria is a beautiful hotel with tons to do an this place is worth a stop but just go to bar and have a few cocktails with the 2 cool cute bartenders.  Those girls are your best bet.	3	Union Restaurant & Lounge	3
"I go out for sushi often and am not afraid to go to a high end place or a dive.  This place had decent atmosphere but is as cold as a brick of ice.  The girl and guy bartenders were as warm and friendly as a pile of rocks.  Are you sick of my analogies yet, ok.  Bottom line,  I ordered sashimi - yellowtail, halibut, tuna, and snow crab.  2 pieces each
And completely overpriced as most strip sushi places.  However, not as good as others.  Miso soup and a martini too and those were pretty decent.  They were an hour from closing and were doing everything to get ready, as most of us would do.  I get it, you want to go home.  You have a number of customers still so stay focused and serve the customers and maybe warm up a little so they feel like you appreciate their business.  Won't be back."	2	Kumi Japanese Restaurant + Bar	3.5
Really a 41\/2.  Back a week later except ate in the bar this time.  Had them make a scallop role in soy paper with caviar on top, awesome.  Also, stuck with sashimi again - yellowtail, snow crab, Japanese halibut, albacore, and octopus.  One tuna nigiri and miso soup too.  Had a couple martini's and had a shot of this unbelievable tequila called Deleon.  Very smooth and unique.  Expensive but we were celebrating so very worth it.  Service was very good and our server was very helpful and offered other local joints to eat at suggestion wise.  Expensive but a great place.	4	Nobu	4
The food and service were very good.  As is typical with Vegas, when you get a bottle of wine they are pouring it at the speed of light so your table drinks faster and they ask you if you want another.  Why not but actually we'd like to taste it.  I had the seabass wrapped in a thin bacon, very good..  The make your own salad with up to ten items was great.  Everybody loved the food, the Orin Swift Prisoner by the bottle was fabulous (red blend from Napa), and the service was very good.  We closed things out with a tequila shot to get things moving along.  Will go back.	4	SEABLUE by Michael Mina	4
This place is still a 4 to 4 1\/2.  Pricey but great food and service.  The steaks, lobster tail, and sea bass were all worthwhile.  They have a nice bar that you can grab a drink at before dinner and the music they play live is nice.  Typically, standards.  Leave room for dessert.	4	Mastro's Ocean Club	4.5
Stayed at the palms, two miles away, and around 1000 pm wanted something to eat.  Everything closed except 24 hour restaurant, which sucks when you want sushi or steak or something more unique.  This place was open to midnight, got there in less than 5 and really enjoyed it.  Nice staff and the quality of the fish was excellent, as good as anything on the strip for 30-50% less.  Had a nice unfiltered sake, a sashimi platter that was great, miso soup and a take on friend chicken that was very good.  Will be back.	4	Yonaka Modern Japanese	4.5
The atmosphere is very nice and the service super attentive.  I've had a lot of nice meals so paying for an expensive business dinner is fine.  The problem here is that the prices are a bit out of control.  Tons of restaurants in Las Vegas that can provide food that is just as good, slightly more quantity, for a more reasonable price tag.  A group of us has a couple glasses of wine, various sashimi options, nigiri options as well, the sea bass hot plate, and a couple of the robatayaki options.  Good quality, nothing earth shattering, but too much for the limited quantity and quality that is matched by a number of other restaurants.  The huge waterfall is seen thru the windows of one specific dining room and is beautiful.	3	Okada	4
More of a 4 1\/2!  Been here a few times and always excellent.  Service, even in the bar. is second to none.  Had the Indian spiced short rib and it's to die for.  So aromatic you can't believe it.  The carrots as a side are nice as well.  They give you so many snacks in the lounge area of the bar - popcorn, olives, miso peas, nuts, small bready pastries and tiny dessert assortment after dinner.  Awesome!  Also had the butter lettuce salad and it was very good.  The pretzel and five grain breads were amazing.  Had their version of an old fashioned and it was good but I have had better.  A Ketel One with three olives was tasty and a 20 year tawny to finish up the meal.  Really enjoyed it.  Will go back.	4	CUT by Wolfgang Puck	4
"Yes, Yes, Yes!!!!!!!!!

Finally a place I can stand eating in Vegas!!!

All organic, they had stevia and the food is fantastic!!

I had the sweet potato waffles, side of poached eggs and side of Amy's sausage, fruit salad and a green tea.  

Fantastic breakfast, great way to start the day and I am definitely eating here again!"	5	Canyon Ranch Cafe	3.5
"This review is bc of the horrible service me and my boyfriend received yesterday. Specifically, the waitress who was assigned to our section. She was short with us the whole time we were there. Not friendly at all. Yet she was chatting it up with the table right next to us for about 5 minutes after she took our order. Maybe they were her friends. Who knows? But the thing that really made me mad is she purposely made jokes about ""raiders fans"" talking extra loud so my boyfriend can hear. I know she saw the raiders hat he was wearing. She just finished taking our order then went on to the next table and started making jokes about the exact team he was wearing. I just think that's rude and NOT professional. I don't care how you feel about the raiders! 

For the rest of the time there she just ignored us. She looks at my empty drink (I saw bc we made eye contact), walks past twice but never said\/did anything. We couldn't even get a refill until we asked. 

The point is, we did not receive the same level of service she was giving the other table RIGHT NEXT TO US! 

My boyfriend wanted to leave her .20 tip but I felt bad so we left her $2. I still don't feel she deserved it though. I just hate not tipping."	1	Metro Pizza	3.5
For my first experience I really enjoyed it.. Happy hour pricing is great and if you go with dessert, try the tempura banana.. You will definitely enjoy it..	4	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5

"Top notch Mexican food just 20 minutes off the Vegas strip.  My lady and I were tired of the over priced and underwhelming options on the strip, so we swung out in the rental to hit a few desert parks on the outskirts on Vegas, hitting Juan's for dinner on the way back.

Juan's did not disappoint.  We sat in bar area, as main dining area was full.  Waiter took drink orders immediately after we sat, then after offered good suggestions on the menu items. Another waiter brought a big bowl of chips with 3 different salsa, some melted cheese, some beans, a plate of fried onion, and a plate of nice hot peppers, a nice damn little meal by itself.

An appetizer of ranchers taco's was 6 excellent tortillas fried crispy filled with shrimp.  We both had Jalisco style platters, she had steak Monterey style, loaded with peppers. onions, and monterey cheese, myself the chicken poblano, a deep, dark mole sauce with sesame seeds.  Both came with a cup of soup, beans and rice and were more than ample sized, that we had take out to drop in the cooler for a morning snack in the desert.

Fairly priced, superior customer service by the wait staff and great portions of real hearty Mexican food and non watered down drinks make this a must stop anytime I am in the Vegas area."	5	Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina	4.5
Really good deep dish pizza but not quite as good as Hollywood Pies in Los Angeles or Little Star Pizza in San Francisco. But it's an affordable option on the strip and well worth the price.	4	Giordanos - Las Vegas	4
"One of the best brunch places on the Las Vegas strip. Their $35 all you can eat small plate deal on the weekend is unmatched. It's like getting a brunch buffet where every item is hand cooked for you. Not one item I had of the 15 we chose from the menu of 20 was bad and some of them were truly fantastic. It's exactly what I like about the idea of a buffet, getting the chance to cajole many different items. 

For $10 more you can add on unlimited mimosas which is a good deal in Vegas where most drinks cost $15 at minimum. I wish they offered more then 5 flavors however, but I can't complain, each one I tried was good.

Will definitely be back for lunch or dinner to try their regular menu. Be sure to join their VIP program on their website so you can get 15% off your meals. Such a great deal and such great food."	5	Border Grill	4.5

I was at Carding's Tambayan on Flamingo and Jones with Denise Fuleihan and Jack Soderberg for the Grand Opening Aug 8. The place was packed. The food and the service was good. The sabau I had later that night was excellent. Overall I had a good time with great friends. Enjoyed listening to my friend Denise sing as always. They had a few other good singers that night also doing karaoke. I however chose not to perform that night. I will go there again.	5	Carding's Tambayan	4
On Saturday the Aug. 15th I went there with two friends after a terrible experience at TGI Fridays on Sahara and Decatur. The prices were much better and the food was great. Been to many of the Denny's here in Las Vegas and most of them have excellent service and food and the prices are reasonable with good portion sizes.	4	Denny's	3
The prices and the food was great. Been to many of the Denny's here in Las Vegas and most of them have excellent service and food and the prices are reasonable. Most of the Denny's are under-staffed especially in service. They work hard to keep up though. Many nights i would come here or another Denny's and there would only be one waitress working the entire floor. We were served in a reasonable time but I feel for the waitress  having to work the floor by herself and the register and bus the tables and all her other duties.	4	Denny's	2.5
Me and my cousins and my sisters had a mini family reunion there recently. The service and wait staff were excellent and always checking in on us if we needed anything and cheerful.  The food and drinks was excellent and reesonably priced and proportioned.	5	Bailiwick	4

Wow, great burger and shake!  The line went fast and they had excellent outdoor seating with a good view of the strip.  These burgers are a little small, but I can't eat a huge one anyway.  They made up for the size with the quality of the meat!	5	Shake Shack	4
Great restaurant, fancy, dark, music and the most attentive service we have had in a long time!   We all got beef Wellington for 2 for $99, generous servings and hands down best meal all 6 of us have ever had!!  The free bread that comes out first is also delicious.  So full could not eat dessert.  Some tables have living room style armchairs to seat at, pretty neat.  The only thing they could improve on is better mixed drink menu with more options.  Go, you won't regret it.  Make reservations it's full up all night most nights.	4	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
After 10 years of being loyal to this Las Vegas restaurant, I think I am breaking up with it. The hot and sour soup that I dream about wasn't "fresh" any more. It tasted like Prefab gelatinous boringness. The sweet and sour shrimp were so over battered and not stir fried with the vegetables. Came out super dry with cold veg and sauce on the side. So different than every other meal we have had. The new format is not working, and I won't be back.	2	Chin Chin	3.5
"Carne Asada Super Nachos for $7.99 -- so good! Ingredients were fresh and lots of flavor. Huge portions of everything, especially meat. 

Cash only (no cards or checks). 

One person working (taking orders and making food). Went at 3:30pm and there was no wait. 

Seating -- some bar stools (6 maybe). I didn't see any tables though. 

Located inside the gas station."	5	Chile Verde Express Mexican Grill	4.5
Got the $4.31 deal for 2 Fremont street tacos and a 12oz PBR. The deal was not on the menu or advertised anywhere that I could see, but I asked a worker about it and they knew exactly what I was talking about. The street tacos are small, about 3 bites each, but they were good. I got one shredded beef and one chicken, both with corn salsa, onions, and cilantro. The shredded beef had more meat in it. See the picture I posted for a visual.	5	Zabas Mexican Grill at the Plaza	3

This outlet mall has improved dramatically since the last time I was there a year ago.  The range of stores is outstanding and it has the higher end stores.  The Cole Haan and Joe's Jeans stores are great here.  The sushi buffet at this mall is also outstanding.  The Polo store could run a few more sales.  It is my least favorite of the Polo outlets.  I prefer the one in Austin, TX, and in Phoenix, AZ.	4	Las Vegas North Premium Outlets	4
Had a dinner meeting here.  Food was family style with no serving utensils.  This was quite interesting.  Had to use other peoples unused forks for serving.  We even ask for serving utensils but I guess it was ignored.  The food was not my favorite, as it was overly spicy.  Some staff were nice and some staff were indifferent to asking for help with our meals.  Wont be back.  Other reviews seem to like the food.  We were in a special room for group meetings and the arrangement of tables are just not a good fit for business meetings.	3	Chica	4.5

My friends and I were staying at the Cosmo and were having a sweet tooth after dinner.  We had to ask the concierge and she suggested Beauty & Essex.  We finally found it on the 2nd floor of cosmo, in a pawn shop, just like a speakeasy.  The desserts were delicious.  I really like the Kygo one (since he's one of my fav. DJs).  Also, we had a very attentative waitress.  Overall great vibes, desserts, and service.	5	Beauty & Essex	4
Place is pretty good but expensive! Almost everything on the menu is $20 bucks or more! Had the lobster rolls which was good. They have lots of beer on tap.. Pretty fun crowd.

The best tapas in town. Must try their Mac n'Cheese. Now I know what you're thinking, Mac n'Cheese?! Why would anyone go to a tapas place for that?! But this is way better than any another Mac n'Cheese you had even had. Other super tasty dishes are their spicy beef salad, lamb crop, stuffed data, sliders and so much more. AND their Sangria, they have awesome Sangria. Get a pitcher and share it with your friends. The place get hotter late at night. Except to wait, this place is pack all the time.	5	Firefly	4.5
"My favorite sushi place in town. Love all their rolls, they fish are really fresh and the chefs there are very creative. Everything I even try there are very yummy. The services are alway friendly. And they open late at night. This is one of those hidden neighborhood jem.

ALSO, lots of bad reviews regarding Osake are for the other one by Lake Mead, most people mistake the two. I been to that one too and they are one of the worst. It's night and day. Please don't let that mislead you."	5	Osaka Japanese Bistro	4
I grow up in Hong Kong so you can imagine how exciting I was when I found this place. Ya sure, lot of place served Cantanese style dishes in town. But to find that East meet West Hong Kong style cuisine, now that's a challenge. I'm talking about curry fish balls, street style wings and even HK style milk tea. Yummy and cheap, that's what it's all about. Don't forget the super yummy Mango desert and Shaved Ice. What better way to beat the desert heat but with a large bowl of shaved Ice top with fruit and sweet condensed milk. Did I mention HK peeps love their sweet :) Yup, brought back lot of fond childhood memory. Good Time ^_^	5	Wendy's Noodle Cafe	4
"Vegan in Las Vegas isn't always easy when you are on the strip. Especially if you want more than just a veggie burger and a boring salad. We were so excited to find Andrea's! 

We stumbled upon the menu while planning an evening exploring the Wynn, and we were searching yelp for a place with Vegan options. We didn't have reservations, the place was packed on a Monday, but they were able to sit us at a bistro table in the bar area. Now, this was the first table by the host stand, which typically would make for a not so great dining experience. But from start to finish we had great service, amazing food and we have zero complaints. 

We were greeted immediately and before we could even ask for vegan options we were presented with an entire vegan and vegetarian menu. You read that right, each table is presented with an epic separate veggie menu, no ""let me ask the chef"" with an eye roll or ""maybe a salad with no dressing"" after asking. We were in heaven. 

We started with the shishito peppers and crispy ginger gyoza. Then split the vegan spicy veggie roll and the impossible burger sliders. Finished with a vegan cookie dough cake pop. Shared a bottle of yummy bubbly. Holy. Crap. 

Now, the impossible burgers definitely lived up to the hype- we could have devoured about 40 of them. Surprisingly, the most delicious thing we ate was the vegan spicy roll! It had been so long since we had a veggie sushi roll that had actual flavor and different textures that we about passed out from pure happiness. 

So the moral of this story. If you are a vegan in Vegas, and you want a more upscale dining experience that doesn't involve manipulating a menu or asking the chef to make something up then Andrea's is highly recommended."	5	Andrea's	4
"Birthday brunch with my babes. My new favorite Asian place on the strip. Good Hong Kong style food. They have some dim sum entries and other great entires. Open late and the prices are reasonable for what you'd expect at the Venetian. 

I personally love this place and they do a good job. I've grown up eating Hong Kong style food so I have a taste for it and know how it should be. This place is on point."	5	Noodle Asia	3.5
My absolute favorite bakery in Vegas! I love that you can get individual cake slices, along with crepes and cream puffs. The ice creams are delicious too. This is a great place to take out of town visitors.	5	SUZUYA Pastries & Crepes	4.5
This is my "cheat meal" spot! Love the tartufo pizza, the beet salad, etc. Terrific wine\/beer selection too. Everything is cooked in the two ovens in the open kitchen. Atmosphere is great, and I enjoy dining on the patio when the weather is nice.  Located right off the 215, it's worth the drive from any area.	5	Due Forni	4
This is a great place for a business lunch, date, even a private event. It's beautiful inside, and the food is upscale fine dining but still approachable. Service has always been top notch. I love the prix fix menu option for lunch. One of my favorites is the seared octopus on the dinner menu.	5	Vintner Grill	4
For Japanese fusion, this is the place! They combine different Asian cultures and styles to create most delicious food. I highly recommend starting with the brussel sprouts, as they are addicting. The menu changes frequently but they have something for everyone. Seafood is always super fresh, with a wider variety than the normal neighborhood sushi joints. Desserts are mandatory. Seriously, don't leave without trying a little of everything.	5	Yonaka Modern Japanese	4.5
This place is  dirty they brought me a cup that still had food on it. The people are rude. We were here for about 30 minutes before they took our order! Yes my first time at this location and my last!	1	IHOP	3
Tao Beach was cool, and the bartenders were super sexy!!!!!!! Went downstairs and I thought this place kinda sucked. Over rated, for sure!!! TOOO ANY losers in there, and it was a meat market!!! Music was good, but too crowded for my taste. I like to dance, not get stepped on!	2	Tao Nightclub	3
So freakin good!!! Cinnamon French Toast. Sooooooo freaking good!!! There is nothing like it!! And the chicken fried steak. O m G!!!!	5	The Henry	4
Really excellent food,service and value.We came here with a groupon,even without it,it would have been a great deal.We had a 6.30 reservation,seated quickly,bread and 3 types of butter,great start.Really pigged out and ordered way too much,but was expecting the usual (tiny) steakhouse appetisers and sides,All were excellent,but the star was the bone in rib eye.Juicy,perfectly seasoned and cooked (medium rare),tasted better than any other steak I have had,and I have had prime cuts twice before.The sides were at least twice the size of any other place I have been and just as good.Great old school service from waiters who I am sure have been doing this for years.Will be a regular place for me every time I visit Vegas.So jealous of you guys who live there to have this place,compared to the over hyped,over priced joints we have in San Francisco!	5	R Steak & Seafood	4
Was really surprised at the quality of food here. Good fish and chips and literally fried right in front of you. Along with a soda the tab was about $16, not bad for Vegas. Also, Vegas strip has become just a place where you are ripped off everywhere you go. There are no deals anymore like the $8 steak and eggs midnight specials and the like. Last straw for me was being charged $10 for parking per day at the hotel I had booked! Am done with being gouged and will get motels from now on!	4	Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips	4
Didn't like this place at all! Kept seeing the TV ad about this place in the station casinos and decide to give it a try! Spring rolls and shrimp and BBQ short ribs! Didn't enjoy none of it and it showed so much that the manager came over and ask if there was something else i would like to try! I refused and thanked her for offering. After a couple of bites i had staff pack up order. I ended up giving left overs to homeless people on the street! I wonder if they were happy?	1	Ping Pang Pong	3.5
Pretty good chicken strips! Nice staff and very clean inside! The cane's sauce (Awesome) and the honey mustard are the only two sauces they have. The fries and texas toast are bomb!!	4	Raising Cane's	4
Oh this is a great place for chinese food! The shrimp fried rice was one of the best i had in a while! For sure if you here try that! I also got the BBQ spare ribs which were ok! They didn't have much meat on them (4 total) but still good! The staff was very good and attentive to all my needs. The place is very clean and well kept. I will be back to try different items but so far i like what i see!	4	Ondori Asian Kitchen	4
I been waiting almost 5 months to eat here and had my mind SET on the homahawk wagyu steak. Can you imagine the pain i felt when i asked for it and the waiter said we are OUT of it at this time? Are you serious? A top notch steakhouse should NEVER be out of anything and especially on a saturday night.. I had to settle for a bone-in ribeye which was good but NOT a wagyu. The VIP cocktails were excellent which is vodka infused with pineapple for $14 bucks each! We even met a nice couple who offered me and my date another round which was awesome. We had a crab cake not cakes, you only get 1 for $20 dollars. Also the lobster mac and cheese which was great and the Maque Choux Corn also very good! The ribeye was nice and tender, but not a tomahawk damnit!! Truffle and bone marrow butter are EXTRA ($6-$7 dollars) They have a guy on the piano all night who is just killing it! He is a great musician. They have a big parking lot for self park and VIP park service. The bar area is wonderful with a piano guy playing. The dining rooms are very nice and clean I just wish they had the wagyu, so sad!! =(	3	Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House	4.5
I always go here for the Gamblers 777 special (not on menu). Steak, mash or fries, broccoli, shrimp on a stick $7.77. (Need to buy drink and show gaming card)  This is a cool little place inside the hard rock hotel and casino. Lucky's was moderately priced.  The HRC Breakfast, which was sausage, bacon and eggs. Not a bad place late at night!!	4	Mr. Lucky's 24-7	3.5
Best place ever!! You can't be the price here for a good steak and the BBQ dinner they have! Also great pizza and beer! For sure this place is a hidden gem in vegas.. The BBQ place you get your standard bbq ribs or bbq chicken. (Served with sides of corn, bread, coleslaw and baked beans) for i believe $15 bucks WITH your players card, $17.99 without it so make sure you sign up first then head for the BBQ place!  The restaurant is also good! We usually get the steak special. Metro pizza is VERY good and this place brew their own beers.. Awesome little spot to visit!!	5	Ellis Island BBQ	4
If your points are paying for the meal then it's worth it but i wouldn't pay out of pocket. Good place to bring kids to fill up on whatever they need. You won't find the best cut of meat here. They do have a good asian and seafood station. They have a good breakfast selection in the AM. The waiters were good at bringing the drinks and getting plates off the table.	3	Medley Buffet	3
Pretty cool place right on the strip! The lobster roll was VERY good and a great staff! Also the cold slaw was awesome as well! They have a little sitting area with about 4-5 tables blocked off from the crowd which is nice! It's located at fashion show facing the strip across from the wynn hotel.. I will for sure be back on my next trip here!	5	Luke's Lobster Las Vegas	4.5
Good breakfast! Probably the best in town next to the egg and I.. They have HUGE pancakes that cover the plate so beware! One or two are good IMO with some sides, Bacon, Ham, Sausages etc.. The guy at the door who greets you is VERY COOL and says hi to everybody that walks in.. They have just about everything breakfast item you want! Monday was about a 10-15 minute wait! I can only imagine the weekends could be up to an hour!! But if your close by give this place a try!! Everybody is nice and respectful here! Love it!	5	Mr Mamas	4.5
If your looking for a place to impress your date this is it! They have one of the BEST Bone-in Ribeye i ever tasted! Lobster Mac and Cheese is KILLER and ROCK SHRIMP is a must! Very beautiful people here and a very trendy place at the place! Staff was great! Would for sure visit this place for dinner before making my way to the hottest clubs around town!	5	N9NE Steakhouse	4
I had the hell burger which had a nice kick and very tasty. The onion rings were not as good as I thought, just ok, I would rather go with the regular or sweet potato fries next time. The strawberry milkshake was great! They have a cool bar area, very good and cool looking place. This place was super busy for a Tuesday! The only thing I would change is the onion rings for fries. The girls in the front and bar waiters were VERY nice and helpful with the menu.. The Hell is the top burger there and second is the Farm burger which i will try next time.This is located in Planet Hollywood Casino.	4	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
Good Pizza! I'm pretty simple so i went with the cheese and pepperoni! The crust was golden soft and great quality on the pizza. I believe they have a location in San Diego area but overall i enjoyed the experience and service here. Cool place to visit! They are close to the big Ferris wheel. There are TONS of cool places along the strip area! Great spots to hangout and people watch! Great service also! I saw a couple who had ordered buffalo wings and they looked mighty good! Thumbs up here!	5	Flour & Barley	3.5
Food good has a Starbucks, Philips seafood, a Di Fara pizza, Earl of Sandwich, Smash Burger and some asian good eats here.  It's good but super expensive i thought but hey you on the strip.	4	Forum Food Court	3.5
I don't know about this place! It's a hit or miss. Sometimes i come here i get good service! The next time i come i wait 10-15 minutes until anybody notice i'm there in the bar area. They do have good food and drinks but the service is not that great! When i come with family the dining area is ok but the bar employees needs to be more active, bar wasn't even full for me to wait as long as i did... I was sitting at one of the open tables near the rail where you can people watch and the girl said that section was closed so i picked another seat and later when i came back from the movies the bar area she kicked me out had people there, not like it was packed or anything! Also behind the bar is this blond girl who is just weird! She has been there for a while because every time i come and see her working the bar area i sit on the other side away from her. Just a weird vibe with this place sometimes..	3	TGI Fridays	2.5
Beautiful setting. Great service.  The food is very good. Some items better than others.  We had two of the Hawaiian fish option. Ono and Mahi, both cooked very well. They offer gluten free bread to start if needed (not good, but nice they have available.) The carrot side is OK...big chunks of carrots dripping in butter. Asparagus was ok, nothing special.  The lobster potato side is decadent, rich, cheesy and memorable.   Great spot to dine.	4	Lakeside	3.5
Really busy, make a reservation. Had dinner in the bar. It's loud and packed, but the wait was an hour. Food is very good, not outstanding, but good. Carnitas plate was tasty.  Pork a little on the tough and dry side. Beans, guacamole & fresh tortillas were great.  Shrimp enchilada good but nothing out of this world.  Overall very good. Service was great at the bar even with how busy it was.	4	Javier's	4
I've been here a dozen times.  The lobster bisque keeps me coming back.  The rest of the good is good to great, but I have never had better bisque, and I've tried it at a lot of nice places.	5	Kokomo's Steak & Seafood	3.5
My first and second visits here were hands down 5 stars. The food was delicious and interesting, and the atmosphere was pleasant. My third and possibly last trip was mediocre. They have opened up a new club at the Hard Rock, and the crowd was a bit too loud and lively for a fine dining restaurant. Their foie gras was delicious, but their sushi wasn't as good as previous trips. If I go again, I'm likely to stick to their hot dishes.	4	Nobu	4
Kobe beef burger juicy and worth every dollar . Good service great interaction with customers. Would come back again.	5	Coffee Pub	4.5
"glorious!

I came here for dinner before the night out.  the cuisine is northern italian and the decor is very clean and simple.  I ordered a salmon with a pesto and caper sauce on a bed of steamed veggies.  it was VERY good.  One friend ordered the braised lamb and it was amazing!  The wait staff is excellent and very knowledgeable and their wine staff was equally as competent.  There is a neat little bar right outside of the restaurant's so you can grab a drink while you wait for seats.  Of course, it is a bit pricey but i have paid more at places for less than average food.

"I have dined at this restaurant twice, my parents recommended the place to me as they have dined there many times. I was impressed the first time and decided I wanted to treat my father to a nice meal for our first time going to Vegas together (father and son time). I made a mistake and accidently called the le cirque in new york when googling the number for le cirque (at that time i assumed there was only one le cirque). When we arrived to dinner (assuming we had reservations), we were involved in a very confusing situation where i thought we had reservations but didn't as i had unknowingly called the one in New York. The manager wasn't very nice about the whole situation (I wish i asked for his name, It was not the French manager he was very polite my last visit) I was polite and was not rude while he was defensive and seemed very agitated. Anyways, the restaurant was full but they offered a table behind the cashier\/waiter's station so we took it. As i was seated I investigated the number I called and that's when I realized the mistake I had made and this is where my issues with the restaurant began....

 I called the manager over so I can explain the mix up as I thought it was sort of funny and he responded in a condescending way ""Yes I told you, we never make mistakes"" and walked away. 

The second thing that happened that night was my father and I were getting a weird vibe from the waiters, us being seated behind their station, we were able to hear them talking about us when we realized that they thought we were a couple. My father and I were embarrassed and he asked the waiter ""Can you take a picture of my son and I"" so the waiters would know we were related. Right after taking the picture he went back a couple feet to his station and told another waiter ""They're father and son"".  I understand that gossip at work is normal and unavoidable, however, I believe it was disrespectful to be gossiping about us feet away where we could hear. And now i wonder what gossiping occurs when seated in the actual dining room. 

This service greatly affected our dining experience as we did not enjoy our meal. Which is sad as there are many other restaurants in Las Vegas that would have treated us better. I have been to many great restaurants such as Alinea, The Cut, Wp24, Mastros, etc. and have never experienced such an awful service experience such as this one. I believe service is equally important as the quality of the food, a dining experience can be horrible if either one is poor. Since this experience my family and I have never returned and never plan on returning, they could offer me a free meal and I wouldn't accept it."	1	Le Cirque	4.5
I had to deduct another star this visit for the entirely underwhelming service. The food came through yet once again, but from the moment we had human interaction with this place, it was just unfortunate. The hostesses seemed to have an attitude and took forever to arrange our table in a completely empty restaurant and our server took forever and just seemed to be going with the motions. Not that I need to be entertained, but be friendly, you're a server. If all we had to do was eat amazing food, this place would get five stars.	3	Hash House A Go Go	4
We went here for my friend's 30th birthday (her choice) and had an amazing time. I don't even like country music and this was still the highlight night of our trip. There was a live band and they also played Top 40 hits in between sets. Our bartender, James, was freakin fabulous. He made us "sweet but strong" shots all night long. The only downside was the 24 hour recovery period, but that was likely my fault :) Can't speak to their food, but their bartenders, music and patrons made for a great night.	5	Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill	3
After seeing the line out the door at Buddy's place, we decided to satisfy our Italian pastry craving with this place instead and they did not disappoint. We tried their cannoli, white chocolate fruit tart and napolean and they were all FABULOUS!	5	Tintoretto Restaurant and Bakery	3
I was in Vegas for 3 days... and ate at Hobak twice!! It was soooo yummy. Service was very good as well. First time I came we had one beef combo & one pork combo. The beef was okay, the only one I enjoyed was the Aged beef short rib, the others were meh. But the pork is where it's at for the BBQ!! Such delicious meats. Don't forget to ask for sesame oil & ssamjang dip for your pork! For some reason the server didn't serve us the spicy pork belly which comes with our combo.. but it's okay we were stuffed by then anyways. We also got the corn cheese... sooooooo buttery and cheesy. And the dessert was SO good. Simple rice cracker with red bean and ice cream. Second time we came back we just had the pork combo, my favourite!! Wish they had this kind of BBQ back home :(	5	Hobak Korean BBQ	4.5
THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH $65 save your money and go to a nice dinner somewhere else instead!!!!  2 stars for the service. Food suck. Crab legs tasted like they were submerged in salt. Oysters were horrible. Meats were dry. The only thing my boyfriend & I ended up eating was pizza & mashed potatoes lollllllll desserts were alright.	2	Bacchanal Buffet	4
The food was absolutely delicious. The temperature was just right. The service was great. Anything on the menu is going to be tasty.	5	Monta Ramen	4
The service was great. The food was good too - minus the fact that my friend had large egg shells in her meal, and when they brought the new plate, the egg was cooked incorrectly. Otherwise, the ambiance is beautiful.	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
Good food at Hexx make sure you go check it out inside of Paris las vegas next to chateau nightclub !	5	HEXX kitchen + bar	4
Pretty good. Ok service. :\/ needed a little more attention but great food. The kitchen saved the day	4	El Segundo Sol	4
Hands down the best buffet ever! What more can I say? The service was excellent and the food was beyond amazing!	5	Bacchanal Buffet	4
DO NOT EAT HERE! The food was the worst food I've ever had. The beans were canned and the enchiladas were absolutely disgusting. I took 2 bites and told the server I didn't like it, the manager said he would only give us 50% off! For 2 bites? Worst part of my Vegas trip was eating at this place. I would give it negative stars if I could	1	Senor Frog's	2.5
The food is great tasting and doesn't leave you feeling stuffed, in fact it's just the right amount of full. Also, the service is fast and friendly.	5	Jaburritos	4.5

Fresh Pasta, great prices, and friendly servers. This place is my favorite Italian place in town!	5	Pastaidea	4.5
I proposed here, and the staff was totally willing to help in any way, and made the evening unforgettable. Beautiful experience, and absolutely incredible food. Worth the price, because the experience is priceless. Pork chop and chicken are terrific.	5	Prime	4
My husband and I recently stayed at the Encore at the Wynn so we decided to have breakfast\/brunch one morning at Jardin. The decor and service were both lovely. My husband had the short rib sliders and enjoyed them. I ordered the maine lobster benedict. There is no egg I love in this world more than a poached egg. Well I received 2 hard eggs on my benedict. I know poaching eggs is an art, however, at this calibur of restaurant there is no excuse for improperly poaching an egg. Honestly for the prices at this restaurant I would not recommend anyone to go here. I do not mind spending $30 on a nice properly prepared brunch for myself. I do mind spending that much when the food is not prepared properly.	2	Jardin	3.5
"Good service. But the last order we had put in took a long while to get. 
Lounge area was blowing cold a\/c. Nice place but needs a little touches here and there."	3	Oyshi Sushi	3.5
Doesn't taste good.  Had burrito with sour cream and gauc with a soda.  Cost $17.  Spend the extra money and go to a better spot.	1	Tacos N' Ritas	3
Bad experience!  Wouldn't allow us to use our groupons. Purchased two of them. Had a group of 7. Manager was rude & could care less if we spent our money there. We walked out without ordering.	1	Cabo Wabo Cantina	3.5
This is a tale of two reviews. When we visited this restaurant in Sept, 2014 the experience, service and food were amazing. We visited again on Nov 11 2015 and the food and service have definitely declined- fries and burgers were sub par and SLOW SLOW SLOW SLOW!! Beer was cold and bubbly at least but we will most likely not return.	3	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
Good place to chill and have a drink. Most of the time I just order their Mediterranean chicken to go, good convenient meal for after the gym considering how late they're open.	5	Layla Grill & Hookah	4.5
This place used to be amazing but ever since they opened the second location it has gone completely downhill. Having been a chef at a sushi bar I can guarantee you NONE of the fish was fresh. In fact not a single piece of food I ate was fresh. Everything from the crab mix to the baked mussels reeked of fishiness. Even the Mochi ice cream was so old, the soft outer shell had become hard and disintegrated into a rough powder in my mouth. They recently fired most of the chefs\/staff and you can definitely tell. The service was slow but it's really not the servers fault because the new chefs don't have proper training or ingredients. I'm honestly not one to write bad reviews but I feel their food is a legitimate safety concern, I myself had stomach pain the entire day after. I would highly recommend not going to Jjanga until they have figured things out once again. I'm definitely rooting for them.	1	Jjanga Japanese Restaurant	4
Nice little neighborhood pizza spot. Not too many places in Vegas to get a decent quality New York slice but this place does just that. 1.75 per pepperoni slice and 1 dollar cheese slices, can't beat that. Good service as well.	4	Carmine's Pizza Kitchen	4.5
One of the best happy hours in Vegas. Food and drinks were great and the service at the bar was no different.	5	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
This place has one of the flamest happy hours in Vegas. Drinks and food are SUPER cheap with pretty decent quality. Great place to go before a night out.	5	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5
Just walk inside and tell them to make you something flame, there's a 1% chance that you won't like it. And if you don't they'll replace it for free.	5	Brew Tea Bar	5
This joint is straight ass. I was given 3 different wait times when I ordered through grubhub. As I'm writing this review, my friend is STILL waiting for his single pizza. It's been nearly 3 hours and we have gotten no word. Shame on ya'll. Shame.	1	Sofia's Pizza	2.5
It's the in-n-out of chicken! (if that makes sense) It's delicious, cheap, and the service is great.	5	Raising Cane's	4
First of all I want to say that I agree with everyone that parking was difficult to find. However, that was not my main problem. When my boyfriend and I walked in we were seated and given drinks almost immediately which was nice, but once our food was served we began to notice issues. First, our waited gave us our order incorrectly even after we had repeated it back to him. Second, we were charged incorrectly for an item that was not given to us. Thirdly, we were charged tax on each separate order as well as well as the grand total (even though we paid on one bill). To be completely honest, it wasn't horrible service, but I say that only because I was in a very good mood at the time. The waiter kept trying to justify his mistakes rather than fix them. The place is just over priced and the staff needs some training.	1	Denny's	3
This place is absolutely amazing. Authentic Mexican food indeed! Great prices and the staff is very friendly.	5	Abuela's Tacos	4.5
After hearing raving reviews about the wicked spoon my bf and I decided to give a go. It is located in the Cosmopolitan (an up scale retro type of vibe) Casino. Located on the second floor of the casino. The line went fairly quick and we were seated quickly. The food was amazing! I love how they serve the food tapas style, it prevents over indulging and being wasteful due to your eyes being bigger than your stomach. The service was great the waitress was on point and prompt. Also for an additional $12.00 you get all you can drink wine which was a plus. I love this place and would definitely recommend it.	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
It would be a nightmare to manage one of these places, it seems like every time we visit it's busy. Not that it's a bad thing! Holly was not our server but saved the day by recognizing no one had stopped by our table yet... So we ordered and enjoyed the food and sides as usual, very consistent which we appreciate. Of course we had to shop a little in the county store and found some gifts	4	Cracker Barrel Old Country Store	3
Essential stop every time we visit Vegas! Get the chicken parmesan, insane value for lunch.	5	Pasta Mia West	4
QUALITY is the word here, pretty much better quality on everything compared to the other high end buffets in Vegas. Worth it if you have never been and are ok with the price.	5	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"We were up here visiting from the bay area and I found this place on yelp because my child demanded rice and beans. The journey to this place was well worth the drive. 

Everything was amazing and the garlic house salsa is like crack.

Best tacos I've had hands down."	5	El Frescos Cocina Mexicana	5
I ordered the traditional mushroom chicken noodle soup. The noodle was TERRIBLE, they don't have any flavor, so PLAIN. No CHICKEN flavor at all. I kept adding salt, hot sauce and jalapeño to make more flavor. Also the service wasn't that pleasing as well.	1	Noodle Asia	3.5
"Where to start....

I have to echo the confusion about how this place only has 2.5 stars.  We just had a terrific meal with Kirbie and Mgr Carl F and could not have been more pleased. 

First, didn't want to spend a ton on wine but wanted to drink good stuff. Carl F recommended some really cool grapes. 

Second, Kirbie was awesome. Food came as expected for a Saturday evening at a popular restaurant and she was terrific.  She suggested items and was always around. 

Third, I had enjoyed a meal here a few months ago and the service and food were equally impressive. Again, sure there was a wait but it's a new place and those of us who have enjoyed new places know this is inevitable. You are not at Chilis!

Fourth, I had eaten at the original location for years and this location didn't disappoint. 

Fifth, we got see a table of crazy folks throw a fit. Carl F handled it like a pro but these people had their heart set on a being pissed so I hope life improves because if that's how they react at a restaurant I can only imagine how they handle real life. 

Bottom line....A cool DTS joint and we'll be back soon...."	5	Grape Street Cafe & Wine Bar	3
Spending $43 for chicken fingers, a chicken sandwich and a couple of beers you'd expect a bit more.  It wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about. Staff was friendly. Definitely a one and done.	3	Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken - Downtown Summerlin	3.5
Great food in a casual atmosphere with non-Summerlin pricing. Pappardelle Alfredo was real good and the wine list is unique and reasonably priced with some good central coast reds.  A very cool neighborhood spot! Definitely be back.	5	Chef Marc's Trattoria	4.5
"Red Square gets 5 stars based on their Happy Hour, or Cavi Hour, alone.  I've never eaten at the restaurant, but have enjoyed what is perhaps the best, albeit high end, meal deal in Vegas many many times.

I've been coming to Vegas since '86 and truly miss being able to get from Bally's to Fremont St in 10 minutes :D.  I also miss the meal deals in those bygone days when you'd eat prime rib and lobster for lunch because it was actually cheaper than a burger.  Red Square offers a bargain that rivals those $3,95 wonder-meals...only at 2009 prices, with much better ambiance, and with higher quality food.

I'm describing the Cavi Hour where you can get 2 martinis and an ounce of Petrossian's osetra caviar for only $30.   Ok, I've eaten at Petrossian's in Manhattan several times and I know that an ounce of osetra there will set you back about $45 (they sell it by the gram, so I did a little conversion for ya!).  And that's if you buy it ""to go"" and of course, it's much more expensive - almost double - if you get the whole set up...and that's what you get at Red Square.  Caviar served on a bed of ice, mother of pearl spoon, blinis, creme fraiche, chopped egg, etc...the whole bit.

Sit at the cool (get it?) ice bar - be prepared to wait for a seat - and enjoy the great bartenders and an ~$100 extravagance for only thirty bucks.  Heckuva way to start the evening!

Update -  Thx to Kurt S. in LA who (gently) corrected me that the caviar is American Sturgeon and not Osetra...hey, at least I calculated the price\/value within a buck :D!"	5	Red Square Restaurant & Vodka Lounge	4
"If you've stayed at the Rio then you've seen the posters for Martorano's.  Big guy, shaved head, tribal ink, and a scowl.  I stay at the Rio 4x or so a year and it's their posters that have helped me resist eating at the restaurant.  As a marketing guy, it was clear that the strategy was to promote this guy's persona and DJ skills rather than focus on the food.

It was a free sample that drew me in.  I was waiting to check-in when a pretty girl came around offering samples of a Martorano's meatball.  I was shocked how good it was...really good...the best I've ever had good... and it was certainly enough to make me want to give the place a try.

Thirty minutes before dinner, I began to have doubts. The reviews for this place were so spotty, I have never heard anyone say anything good about the place, and I wanted to have a great dinner.  Should I risk it? Maybe I should take one more look at the menu.  It all looked good and I was fired up to go there again until I read the end of the menu: ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGES OR SUBSTITUTIONS. JUST LET ME DO WHAT I DO AND DON'T BREAK BALLS.  The ""balls"" thing was kind of Philly-clever and I liked it, but the ""absolutely"" thing reeked of immature hubris. If you're giving it to me, I'll accept that, but since it's my nickle and if my request is reasonable, then it's my way or the highway.  Despite this nagging ""don't do it"" feeling, I decided to give it a shot. Should I have listened to my instincts?

The entrance to Martorano's opens to the bar where it's intimate with a clubby feel.  Before being seated I took a look at the dining area.  Gone was the low light and rich feel of the bar and instead you're treated with a stark open plain and uninteresting room. There's nothing noteworthy about the decor other than there really isn't any. Pretty bland open room.  What I gather is supposed to pass for some kind of industrial minimalist effect simply looks unfinished and incredibly boring. The awesome news is that the dining room blares dance music at ~2 little notches below club volume.  The other reviewers weren't joking; it's loud.  The only other time I've heard music that loud at a restaurant was at a ""rock n' roll"" teppanyaki place where the cooks fling rice at the kid's mouths. BTW, that restaurant sucked as well so I opted to sit at the bar.

Wow, only one other customer at the bar and he's getting his check.  I'm gonna get great service, right?  Hang on....the bartender...let's call him ""Dick""...wants to bus the guy's area before he acknowledges me.  A long 4 minutes later, Dick comes by to get my drink order.  I get my drink and my menu and try to decide what to eat.  I had a few questions about the menu, but Dick is still really busy...intensely focused...tending to his empty bar.  I called out my questions and he yelled back his answers OVER HIS FREAKIN' SHOULDER.  You see, Dick was far too involved going thru the day's tickets and lining up glasses etc to actually look my way, let alone stand in front of me. Clearly I was an interruption to him.  If I hadn't been starving I would've bolted, so in an attempt to minimize my time here I decided to have just an app  - the meatball with a salad.

While I was waiting for my food, Dick continued to amble about behind the bar, not once coming by (and the waitstaff wasn't keeping him busy). The food came. I ate it.  Dick continued to personify his nickname while doing his busy work.  Wait...2 girls just sat down...busy work is over and he's got all the time in the world for a 10 minute flirt session.  Ah...Dick wasn't that busy after all, was he?!  He was just being Dick.

The meatball was again really good, but a gristle in a meatball is JV and I found a gristle in my last bite, so it wasn't that damn good after all.  I got the hell out leaving a far too generous $2 tip...wish I'd left the goose egg.

This is an odd review but it's an odd restaurant.   The dining room ambiance is such an anomaly that the only crowd I believe this restaurant could appeal to are perhaps some teens and young twenty-somethings that like the loud music and probably haven't had a lot of (any?) fine dining experience.  I'm certain this place thrives on Vegas first-timers and unsuspecting others since I can't imagine anyone enjoying an expensive dinner in their dance floor environment.  

Trust the 1 and 2 star reviews.  The bartender appeared to be some sort of manager and with his kind of skills, I'm sure the rest of the food sucks as hard as the service.

A final note:  this is definitely NOT a $$$ restaurant.  If a couple each has a cocktail and splits an app, has a salad and a mid-priced entree with a glass of wine and no sides and no desert, it will cost upward of $180 before tip.  The only way to get out with the $$$ rating is to have no alcohol or under-order."	1	Martorano's	3.5
"Perhaps the finest dining experience I've ever enjoyed.  

I went with 3 friends.  We were fortunate to be seated in one of the private ""cabana"" booths surrounded by flowing white drapes.  Rather than go for the prix fixe menu, we ordered a la carte and shared salads, 4 apps, 4 entrees and 2 desserts.  

The service was attentive, informative, and fun.  We were fortunate that our waitstaff were personable and truly understood how the food was prepared.  The sommelier was knowledgeable and one of the few I've ever encountered that actually understood what we wanted and then, rather than push wines, brought us the perfect bottles 

The food was outstanding, from presentation to tasting.  With so many different dishes, we tasted everything and truly, each plate was a different degree of wonderful.  I'm not going to attempt to describe each and every dish, but from the beets to the foie gras to the short ribs to the monkfish to the chocolate tasting to the souffle and everything in between, it was all amazing.

Almost 3 hours later, we left the sanctity of the cabana to the main restaurant, and realized that we had experienced something really special. Do yourself a favor and just go..."	5	Fleur by Hubert Keller	4

"Hubby found this place on yelp and wanted to check it out, since he's a huge beer snob.  We were impressed upon entering the establishment: very high ceiling, a trendy warehouse feel to the bar, and unpretentious bar staff.  Hubby had the Nogne O, which he quickly proclaimed to be the best beer he has ever drank.  I am not a beer drinker, but greatly enjoyed my ahi tuna sandwich (the wasabi mayo was lovely!).  I WANTED to try the deep fried oreos (what? what??), but I was too stuffed from my sandwich, piggie that I am.

I'm giving this place 4* because of the cig smoke.  Yes, yes, I KNOW that casinos are allowed to have smoke -- and Aces and Ales has a few electronic gambling machines -- but the smoke really bugs me.  Before all you smoky types tell me not to go to places with smoke, I will say: I normally avoid smoky places!  I wanted to support my hubby's fledgling yelp search and check out Aces.  We won't be back for a while, partly because of the smoke, but mainly because of how far it is from home (we live in the NW part of town, aka California....ha).  

Very impressed with the nice gal behind the bar.  :)"	4	Aces & Ales	4
"I'm not a beer drinker but I've been here many times over the past year, mainly for the happy hour (half price on appetizers and discounted drinks) and have enjoyed each visit.  If you are a beer lover, this place is for you.  There are over 100 beers from which to choose, all excellent and worthy of serious consideration, according to my husband, a huge beer lover.

The food is great and consistently well done.  Menu choices include  ethnic-inspired dishes (Korean short ribs, noodle dishes), burgers, seafood, and steak.  On this visit, I had the turkey burger, which is one of the better ones I've had anywhere.  Even without cheese (I'm allergic to dairy), the burger had loads of flavour and was moist.  The accompanying fries were thinly sliced and abundant.  My husband had the full rack of St. Louis ribs and the meat literally fell off the bone.  Each rib had plenty of meat and the bbq sauce was spicy and tasty.  Hubby's sides were a lovely serving of cilantro infused baked beans and creamed corn, the latter of which featured ""a ton of butter and cream"" (sayeth the spouse).  We both finished half of our meals and are looking forward to tomorrow's lunch.

For dessert, I chose the mini peach-apple cobbler (ice cream on the side and happily consumed by hubby) and it was warm and full of fruit.  The size of the dessert was perfect: just enough to satisfy, not too much to sicken.  :)  

Yard House would garner 5 stars from me if the servers displayed consistent service.  Some days, my server is awesome, not too attentive but just enough, courteous and charming, and nailing every dining request I may have.  Other times, I'll see the server two times, the first time to take the order and the second time to bring the cheque.  Today's server was good and would rate an 8.5 (she remembered that my turkey burger was supposed to be cheeseless but forgot to include my garlic aioli sauce on the side).  

All in all, overall great food and decent service.  I always have a good time when I go and it's one of my go-to places for a fun time."	4	Yard House	4
Lovely service and yummy food.  I ordered the egg white\/turkey scramble with seasoned potatoes and coffee cake.  All were very tasty.  The coffee cake *may* be made from a mix....tasted like a mix cake, but I scarfed it down anyway.  Great place for a casual, fun breakfast\/brunch\/lunch!	4	The Cracked Egg	4
Cute and unassuming.  I wasn't blown away by my cappuccino (any place that offers 16 oz and 20 oz sizes makes me suspicious) but it was better than I expected, cynic that I am.  My coffee wasn't bitter, but it didn't have a memorable zing to the taste.  Maybe too much milk?  I was actually famished, as I had just biked 30 miles and my ham sandwich was devoured in seconds.  It was good.  The decor is nice, nothing to write home about, but the place is large with a goodly amount of seats and is clean.  Bonus points for roasting their own coffee, but I'm hesitant to give this place a full 5 stars, if only because of my average 16 oz cappuccino.	3	Chieti Coffee & Roasting	4
"Went here last night for another KoMex fix and ordered the bulgogi (beef) and pulled pork sliders.  Holy cow, the sliders were fabulous!  The bulgogi was also wonderful and when paired with some kimchi = :) to the nth power.  

Go.  And leave a big ol' tip because even with a big ol' tip, you'll still marvel at the ridiculously cheap cheque.  Last night's dinner: free chips and guac\/salsa, free bottled water, bulgogi beef plate, 3 pulled pork sliders, a side of (free) kimchi, free orange slices and fortune cookies = $12.95.  Sick.  We gave them a 50% tip and it STILL came well under $20."	5	KoMex Fusion	4.5
Really yummy food!  I had the kafta kabob meal (about $9), which came with a load of rice, salad, and a pita bread.  The kabobs were spiced ground beef shaped into sausage-like bodies.  Paired with the accompanying sauce (tasted like cilantro?), the result was flavourful and fresh.  Tons of food and tasty.  The small but well-kept interior is cheery as is the staff.  My only quibble is that my meal took longer than expected for this "express" establishment (~15-20min....I was the 2nd to order out of 2!).  However, I'm willing to wait for made-to-order yumminess done right.  Great lunch place that doesn't break the bank.	4	Kabob Express	4.5
We had a great time here last week and enjoyed our respective ramen bowls very much.  One guy in our small group was hesitant about trying anything "adventurous," but he was a total convert after his first few bites, finishing up not only his own ramen bowl but his wife's as well!  I had the Chashu Ramen with miso broth (3 pieces of pork) and it was delicious.  The broth wasn't too salty and the savoury flavours of the meat and noodles was a symphony in my mouth.  My friend's spicy ramen was well appreciated and it disappeared in a hurry!  Prices are reasonable (bowls are under $10) and service is fast and friendly.  The restaurant is pretty small, though, so be prepared to wait a little, and make sure your entire party is present to be seated, otherwise you will have to wait.  Reservations not accepted.	5	Ramen Sora	4
"I have had consistently excellent visits here and highly recommend Due Forni.  Everything I've sampled have been fresh, hot (or cold depending on item), and delicious.  From skewered dates to gnocchi to the pizza (prosciutto e rucola; Due Forni namesake pizza), I can't select a favourite item.  I've only had the Neapolitan crust and will try the Roman crust next time.  (The former is baked for 90 seconds at 900 degrees, resulting in a light, chewy crust.  Roman crusts are baked at 500 degrees for 3 minutes, resulting in a thin, firm crust.)

Service is fantastic.  Don't be surprised if the servers remember you!"	5	Due Forni	4
Tiny hole-in-the-wall joint in a strip mall featuring a variety of cheap, delicious Asian mom-and-pop eateries.  I'm not going to say anything that differs from what my other yelp colleagues have said; I will concur with the majority in that I found Monta Ramen's enormous bowls of steaming, savory goodness satisfying for the body and soul.  For less than $10 a bowl, anyone lucky enough and patient enough to snag a seat (no reservations; you sign your name on the queue list and temper your impatience) will be rewarded with yumminess that will live on for the rest of the night.	4	Monta Ramen	4
"A hidden little family owned restaurant close to UNLV that features spicy dishes!  Upon entering the establishment, I noticed that all of the patrons were Asian....truly a mark of authenticity.  :)  The interior was clean and cosy and service was efficient enough, if lacking in warmth.  Unfortunately, the credit card machine wasn't working that day, which meant we had to do some scrounging to find enough cash to pay the bill.  

We ordered the spicy eggplant, the spicy tofu, and the tofu\/fish dishes.  All were very tasty and spicy, but not *too* spicy.  I could taste the non-spice elements easily.  My only criticism is that the eggplant dish was a bit on the oily side, but then again, eggplants are the sponges of the veggie family, soaking up whatever they come in contact with!

I would definitely come here again to enjoy some yummy food in a quiet atmosphere close to UNLV.

*FYI: Jugoo is in the same little plaza as the Smashburger on Maryland Parkway.*"	4	Jugoo Chinese Restaurant	3.5
Dropped by here after work and picked up a few treats for home consumption.  The small shop only has seating for a dozen people with the bulk of the floor space devoted to the display cases and kitchen (everything is made on-site).  Since I was there after 5pm, there weren't a lot of items left, but I still snagged an apple pie, a piece of chocolate cake, and a piece of strawberry shortcake.  The thing I most appreciated about my items was that they were not too sweet.  While I am a fan of sugar and buttercream and frosting, I do enjoy tasting the actual ingredients in my baked goods.  The Fuji apples in my little pie were well-spiced and bursting with flavor, providing great textural contrast to the pastry.  Both the chocolate cake and the shortcake featured alternating layers of cream filling and delicate cake; in addition, the robust dark chocolate shavings on the chocolate cake provided tooth resistance and melted satisfyingly on my tongue.  I could taste the quality of the ingredients and the care lovingly put into the products.  Service was friendly and I was thanked for coming in to visit.  How nice!	4	SUZUYA Pastries & Crepes	4.5
A solid place for Greek comfort food in a casual cafe-meets-deli atmosphere.  Everything we had was delicious and served promptly.  My lemon-herb chicken pita went down very easily: savoury and herby and all-round yummy.  Hubby had a veggie combo with dolmades, spanikopita, etc. and enjoyed each bite.  Major points for food deliciousness but a star taken off for dirty floors and slightly sticky tables!  (I've made those comments about other places....broken record? or just over-observant clean freak?)  Staff was not as friendly as I expected them to be, but I'm still giving 4* because the food was great.	4	Yassou	4.5
4 stars for solid service, presentation, and quality of food.  I do think that this place is a wee bit overhyped and a bit on the spendy side....however, I thoroughly enjoyed my turkey burger and waffle fries and stuffed myself to the brim with the milk chocolate caramel apple crisp.  Interior is on the dark (chocolate?) side, lots of dark wood and browns throughout the place.  I WANTED to take the 11 pound chocolate bar home with me, but reason prevailed.  Sigh.  Maybe next time.	4	Max Brenner	4
"This little gem is in back part of the series of shops east of the Whole Foods\/Sports Chalet complex on Charleston.  It's a little bakery\/bistro with a plethora of pastries as well as real food!  My lunch companions enjoyed the flakiness of the quiche and the savoury soup and we all happily consumed our various desserts.  I had the lemon tart which was like eating sunshine.  Very very smooth and lovely lemony goodness with each bite.  Not too tart and not too sweet.  I also bought a half dozen macarons (vanilla, chocolate, mint chocolate, lemon) and all were tasty; the meringue cookies had a nice amount of resistance when biting into them and the filling was also just right.

Service was friendly and the place was very clean.  Not the coziest atmosphere, but cheery enough.  Check it out!"	4	Patisserie Manon	4
"My large group enjoyed our time at happy hour here last night.  Really good food (the mini pizzas are large enough for a full meal and are only $5 during happy hour!) and drinks make happy guests.  The interior is what I would call ""rustic chic,"" with dark wood everywhere.  

Since the place just opened, service was not perfect (a few orders were misplaced and incorrect drinks were served) but the servers themselves were really nice and quick to correct any oversights.

I can see this place becoming a regular venue in my happy hour rotation!  Yay for another great place on the west side!"	4	Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana	4
i had ONE piece of sushi left at the end of my meal. seriously, ONE! the lady server told me if i don't finish it i'd have to pay fir that whole sushi roll. so instead of arguing with her i just shoved that last piece in my mouth. so silly. what a way to lose a customer...over 1 piece of sushi lol	1	Sushi Twister	4
"I am lactose-intolerant.

I also miss having pizza and cheese and lasagna.

My husband has sacrificed his pizza eating ways for me, because he knows that I can't have any and that it's just not a good idea to eat a whole pizza solo.  I was craving pizza and knew that suggestion would make him happy, so I decided to check yelp and found all these lovely reviews for Rocco's.

We went there last night and got a slice of the works and a slice of the pepperoni\/sausage.  The interior is small, with a few tables and visible attempts at making the place look like a NYC local neighbourhood pizza joint (B&W pictures from years gone by, faux brick on the walls, etc.).  The food?  We should have ordered a whole pizza!  Nice thin crispy crust, flavourful tangy tomato sauce, and the cheese!  So good, so stringy and melty.  

Good thing I ingested my lactose pills!  (I come prepared.)

4* for now until the next visit.  I'll have to try their garlic knots and check out the AYCE deal."	4	Rocco's NY Pizzeria	4
One of the few places in the Providence area (as far as I know) to grab a quick bite, it was with great relief I stepped inside, for I was really hungry after biking 25 miles.  If I wanted to complete the rest of my ride, I needed food stat!  The place was clean, my sub was good, and my cookies were inhaled in 10 seconds.  A friendly suggestion to the managers of this franchise location: you may want to hire another sandwich artist!  My visit today was during the lunch hour and there were 6 or 7 people ahead of me in the queue.  The two staff members were not the fastest, nor the friendliest, and all told, it took almost half an hour from placing my order to receiving my food.  I think that's a little slow, but perhaps I was biased and just plain hungry!	3	Subway	3
"Close to REI (!!), good prices, great food quality, huge portions, yummy cranberry walnut cookie.  :)  It's upscale cafeteria dining with table service!  I like the low-cal options as well as the salad bar (unlimited house brand graham crackers?!!! they're so good!).  Unpretentious and great for hanging out.  I came here the other night with two musician friends to talk shop and we stayed for a couple of hours without guilt.

Did I mention how good that cran-walnut cookie is?"	4	Jason's Deli	3.5
It is such a pleasure to be a customer when the owner and staff make you feel wanted and welcome, vs wanting your money!  Each time I call to place a takeaway order and each time I visit makes me smile because I know the other person is smiling too.  The pizza itself is delicious and fresh and boasts a crust that is chewy and crisp (how is that possible?); everything tastes just as good the next day.  Prices are competitive with other pizza joints around town -- a large pizza is $19.99 and is sliced into 8 big pieces -- but you may get MORE for your money here, due to the wonderful customer service included in every order.	5	Biaggio's Pizzeria	4.5
"Again, I'm slow on the review uptake....I'm an avid hiker and after a long day in Red Rock, I want food NOW.  My hiking buddies and I decided to check out Mark Rich's in the Albersons' complex on Charleston and Desert Foothills.  I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my lunch!  My group ordered a variety of items, including the tuna melt sandwich, chicken wings, and spinach calzone.  Portions: large.  Service: really nice! (and super accommodating when it came to splitting the cheque).  Food: yummy!  Of course, anything with cheese pretty much guarantees a party in the mouth (even for lactose-intolerant folks like myself), but I didn't notice overgreasiness (is that a word?).

I'm sorry that I can't comment on the pizza -- funny how no one in my group ordered any pizza at a pizza joint! -- but perhaps I'll update this review after my next post-hike lunch.  It looks like this place suffers a little from inconsistent quality, judging from the yelp reviews, but on my visit, everything was good enough to warrant a second visit."	4	Mark Rich's New York Pizza & Pasta	3.5
"Rachel's Kitchen has been on my bookmark list for a while now and I finally visited it a couple of months ago (bad yelper....but better late than never).  My first thought upon entering the Trailwood\/Summerlin location was ""huh....clean space, nice colour scheme, but the decor was kind of sparse.""  Less is usually more, but I thought that the walls could have used a *bit* more decorative love and\/or larger wall art.  

Service was friendly and the food, which is the most important thing, was very good.  I had the garden veggie burger and sweet potato fries and hubby had the Cobb salad.  We enjoyed our meals a lot and were happy with the freshness, quality of ingredients, and overall flavour.  Prices may seem a tad bit on the spendy side, but 1) Summerlin location = $$ and 2) quality ingredients cost a bit more than mediocre ingredients.

I plan on coming back here to sample the baked goods and brunch items.  I'm glad that this location is so close to home!"	4	Rachel's Kitchen	3.5
"How can you not like made-to-order burgers with Asian flair?  My Kalbi burger -- Angus beef marinated in kalbi sauce with kimchi -- was delicious.  Hubby's Ronin burger -- Angus Beef, caramelized onions, Japanese coleslaw, and a fried egg -- was colourful and juicy.  We thoroughly enjoyed our selections, despite an unusually long wait for our fries (20 min?).  No explanation as to why the fries were missing.....

Check out Bachi for a fun fusion experience."	4	Bachi Burger	4
I am a new convert to coffee, introduced to the joys of caffeine by my coffee-connoisseur husband (really! the man used to home roast his own beans and owns a top-of-the-line espresso machine AND grinder).  We went here on a 'date night' and I was reminded of how much I like this place: good brew, yummy pastries, very cool interior, live music!  The only thing that may deter would-be patrons is the relatively high prices for the goods: I want to say about $5 for a muffin?  (They're really good, though...)  I'm really glad there's a non-Starbucks hangout place on the west side, especially one with beautiful wood tones and ridiculously high ceiling!	4	Sambalatte Torrefazione	4
"My first visit here was nice.  Not overwhelming, but comfy and cosy.  Next few visits were kind of blah, as I didn't particularly enjoy the food.  My most recent visit was a couple of days ago and I had a lovely time, mainly because of the company, the well-done food, and the charming server (who called me ""beautiful""....sure, that may be cheesy, but what woman doesn't appreciate being called beautiful?).

The menu doesn't feature anything exotic or out-of-the-ordinary, but you will find your comfort food and your bar food and a decent selection of brews.  I like the food at 4Peaks (in AZ) and YardHouse better, but Gordon Biersch is a viable alternative."	3	Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant	3.5
"Hubby and I were desiring bbq after watching numerous episodes of Man vs Food.  Viewing a grown adult man consume pounds of smoky bbq'ed beef sounds distasteful at first....until the countless close-up shots of juicy pork and chicken and beef start to invade one's consciousness.  Gah.  We dropped into the Las Vegas Grille and were happily surprised by the cheeriness of the interior and the friendliness of the owner.

This place is super fun and serves up delectable food.  The wings are smoked which results in less fat!  Healthy(ish) wings!  I ordered the brat and 3 Hawaiian meatballs and both were so flavourful and fresh.  Since the sausages are made in-house, there are no bad-for-you chemicals in the food.  Hubby's chicken was crispy and juicy and the various sides we ordered were tangy, provided ample textural contrast (rainbow coleslaw, braised red cabbage, Bavarian potato salad), and were not dripping in mayo\/other sauces.  The Thai curry sausage was yummy and spicy.

Phil, the owner, takes such pride in his craft which is a delight to behold (and consume).  He also has a sense of humour; after ordering my brat and meatballs, he replied, with an evil grin: ""so, you want a sausage and balls?""  Hee hee.  Ok, yes, that appealed to my inner 12 year old boy.  ;)

Prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get (lots) and the type (meat).  Not a lot of veggie-friendly options, as the joint is a BBQ place, but there are a few sides and salads that fit that bill.

Go and support this fantastic local business!"	5	The Las Vegas Grille	4.5
I know that one's review of an establishment is influenced greatly by the ambience experienced and service received, as well as food quality (if the establishment is a restaurant).  My recent visit to DW Bistro scores an A+ on all of those points.  I enjoyed the banter of my very funny server, the beautiful contemporary chic of the interior, and my meal!  The cool modern décor was truly a feast for the eyes (see website for pictures).  As for the actual food, yum!  We started with the pesto torte appetizer, a lovely blend of cream and goat cheese topped with fantastic pesto and nuts.  The size of this appetizer was quite large, easily besting my party of four (really).  I'd come back for that appy alone.  Other dishes selected included the Jamaican curry chicken bowl over couscous grains so big they seemed fake (it was very tasty though and the portion size was enormous), braised oxtail (tender and covered with a sweet glaze), and the New Mexico chili cheeseburger with sweet potato fries (the green chili tasted very similar to what I had during my time in NM).  Dessert was the trio cake sampler (chocolate, carrot, red velvet).  I think my favourite was the red velvet due to its tangy frosting.  Yum!  The carrot cake was also very very good and featured pineapple and white chocolate flakes.  We left DW Bistro stuffed and satisfied.  I'll have to return for brunch!	5	DW Bistro	4.5
"Family owned bakery with very friendly staff.  Whilst chatting with the owner, he told me that all of the baked goods are made from ""actual recipes"" from ""grandmothers' kitchens"" that go back decades.  The girl behind the counter kept offering free samples of cookies....I told her to stop that, as my willpower is very limited!  I ended up buying a pound box of assorted cookies - chocolate sandwich, mini lemon scones, jam thumbprint, pecan, shortbread, etc. - and all were delightful.  Freed's cakes look beautiful and I wish I had a cooler in my car so I could take some of them home (I feared for my potential cakes' lives, as many of them featured beautiful buttercream frosting that would have melted sadly in the heat!).  Next time, Freed's, next time.....post-Hallowe'en treat?  ;)

Check this place out and support a local business!"	5	Freed's Bakery	4
"Lovely interior replete with dark wood and dark brown leather.  Service was friendly and polite; props to the server who was waiting on the table of 55+ ladies next to us, as said ladies were NOT happy about waiting more than 5 minutes for made-to-order pizza.  Hubby and I waited for 20-25 minutes, but were VERY happy with our ""Di Fara"" special: a square -- not round! -- pizza featuring Dom's tangy red sauce and topped with pepperoni (yum!!), fresh and aged mozzarella, and fresh basil. Wow.  So good.  (One had the choice between square and round for most of the pizzas except the Di Fara.)  

The bar area was busy and boasted a full array of alcoholic delights from our perspective.  

The food arriving at the tables around us looked amazing and smelled even better.  If it hadn't been for the enormous pizza in front of us, we may have been a wee bit jealous of everyone else's food!  We are most definitely coming back here again soon to enjoy the chic atmosphere and fantastic pizza.  Not a place to visit if you are in a rush, but if you are wanting to relax and savour your visit, then come on down."	5	Dom DeMarco's Pizzeria & Bar	4
Fun atmosphere, tasty food, and solid presentation all make for a reliable "go-to" spot when hunger strikes.  My strawberry and spinach salad was appetizing and colourful and hubby's pasta was savoury and rich.  Everything was served with a (genuine) smile and we enjoyed our time feasting and people watching.	4	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
Came here again the day after I visited Island Flavor for the first time.  Had the kalua pork and cabbage -- great!  However, the topper was the chantilly cake!!!!  SO GOOD.  4 layer chocolate cake with cream filling and a butterscotchy icing reminiscent of the icing for German chocolate cake....swoon.  Drool.	5	Island Flavor	4.5
"I'm happily impressed with the friendliness of the staff at this location.  The last time I ordered a takeaway sandwich, I used a survey receipt coupon (fill out a survey, get a few dollars off your next sandwich) and the lady behind the counter seemed genuinely pleased that I did that.  She also gave me a free brownie.  :)  I'm a sucker for bribes, especially when they consist of baked goods.  

Still not too taken with the less-than-immaculate floors, but the sandwiches are on point and I haven't incurred any illnesses from eating them!  I'll continue to order my Bobbie until my body rebels in some form or another."	4	Capriotti's	4
"I've been here a couple of times and have enjoyed both the food and ambience.  The sushi is pretty decent, nothing ""wow,"" but fair for a joint so close to the university.  I like the high energy of the place: it's pretty small, but Yama packs in a lot of people into that small space....like sardines, one may say.  On my last visit, my friends and I ordered the Manwhore, the spicy salmon roll (forget the name), chicken teriyaki, and a few maki rolls.  All were served fairly quickly and the rolls looked fairly fresh, not too much rice and a decent amount of fish.  

The AYCE deal is probably a great one for those with bottomless pits for stomachs.  I'd love to do that, but alas!, I have a limited capacity in my tummy.  

A solid place for one's sushi craving."	3	Yama Sushi	4
"My first outing to Origin India was with a lovely group of piano students and their fabulous teacher.  About half of the group was new to Indian cuisine and I think that they were suitably impressed -- and satiated -- after the meal.  

Located right by the Hard Rock Cafe, about a mile from the Strip and super close to UNLV, this Indian eatery is on the pricier side, but the food quality and the interior decor reflect the spendiness well.  Warm rich wood tones and relaxing browns and beiges dominate the interior, with pops of colour and tastefully chosen wall art.  Can I say this place is ""modern Indian?""   

My party chose a variety of dishes (paneer, lamb curry, lentils, okra, etc) and everyone was happy and stuffed.  Tasty sauces, pretty presentation.  Nothing I had was super spicy, which will make those spice-phobes happy.  (I didn't ask, but I'm sure you can request more\/less spiciness.)  A few of the kiddos had room for dessert (aaaah....to be young again with unlimited stomach capacity and high metabolism....).  I did not.

I'll check this place out again when I want to be close to the Strip, but not on it!"	4	Origin India Las Vegas	3.5
"I've visited Firefly on a few occasions and am only reviewing now....bad yelper.  Hubby surprised me by taking me here for a quick early dinner before opera rehearsal and it was a welcome diversion.  We shared a red wine sangria, tuna peppers (tuna salad stuffed into wee red peppers; lovely bright flavour), sausage plate, tortilla a la espanola, filet mignon sliders (2 lovely little baby burgers with plenty of cheese), and albondigas (meatballs in a very yummy sherry tomato sauce).  It's so easy to overeat here, because each selection seems so darn small (what?  Only 4 meatballs?? only 2 sliders?), but after trying a few things, your tummy definitely says stop.  Had to have dessert -- i AM a girl -- and chose the chocolate tres leches cake.  Gah, so good.  Delectable.

All hot items were hot, all cold items were cold, and service was pretty decent.  This place fills up fast, so don't come here with a strict timeline.  Atmosphere is trendy, young, chic, which can translate as ""low lighting and close quarters,"" but also interpreted as intimate and cozy.  :)"	5	Firefly	4.5
Cheap, made-to-order burgers featuring fresh ingredients?  Yes please!  Very busy during the school year, so visit accordingly.	4	In-N-Out Burger	4.5
Another casual spot close to the university that serves as a fun meeting point for solid diner grub.  (I've been told it's also a great place to remedy a night of overhydration....)  I had a lovely apple sausage omelet with 3 buttermilk pancakes as a (huge) side; everything was hot, fresh, and yummy.  Piggie that I am, I ate the whole thing, much to the admiration of my brunch buddy.  :)  Our server was super nice and joked with us whilst taking our order, delivering our food, and whisking away our cleaned dishes.  Great value and comfy environment make this a winner in my books.	4	Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant	4
"The original KoMex location is one of my favourite places to go in the city for delicious eats and friendly service.  This new location is larger and shinier than the original and boasts a bar!  (No drink menu yet though.)  There was even a large, flat-screen TV in the bar area, conveniently situated for those wanting to watch the current sports game whilst enjoying KoMex's fusion delights.  I DID find it odd that there was a large empty space in front of the entrance.  Perhaps the restaurant's order for more tables and chairs was exceptionally tardy?

I'm glad to report that the food is still as yummy as found at the original KoMex.  Service is still friendly, but my server must have been new, because she was on the slow side in responding to requests (we wanted condiments and utensils!).   We still received our free chips\/salsa\/guacamole and the dessert orange and prices, while slightly higher than in early 2013, are still very reasonable.

All in all, I'm glad there is a second location on the west side, as that is evidence that the owners are doing well!"	4	KoMex Fusion	4.5
My visit here was my cycling lunch stop, so I was probably more happy than the average patron to see these golden arches.  This McDs is renovated in the dark-wood-meets-quasi-Starbucks-style and while all appeared trendy and chic (one could even watch the game on the suspended flat-screen TV), closer inspection revealed a floor that needed to be swept and a few tables that required a good wipedown.  We had to wait longer than I wanted (10 minutes!) for my food, but then again, I was only half done my 50 mile ride at that point and wanted food NOW.  Also, exacerbating the wait, I know that drive-thru customers get priority, due to corporate demanding fast order-to-receipt times.  However, my fries were salty and hot, my burger was fresh and tasted the same as other McDs burgers I've consumed, and child chatter was minimal.  ;)	3	McDonald's	1.5
"I'm pleasantly surprised by how good my food was here and how nice the servers were.  On previous visits, my food was lackluster and service matched that ambivalence.  Hubby and I wanted some calories NOW as we just finished a gnarly hike an hour prior.  He wanted a place to chill, enjoy a beer, and eat some comfort food.  Since BJ's was kinda sorta on our way home, we decided to check it out again.  I'm glad we did.  Hubby's steak salad was all that he wanted and my turkey burger and wedge fries hit the spot.  Service was nice and friendly.  I was amused to note that the staff who brought our food to our table assumed the ""chick"" ordered the salad.  HA HA.  NO.  I may be fun-sized, but I can put away a LOT of food, especially after a long day hike.  :)

We enjoyed our calorie-induced coma whilst watching the Super Bowl on the many TV's in the restaurant.  It wasn't too crowded at all; I think most people were watching the game at home.  Great way to end a great hike."	4	BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse	4
Who doesn't know about Panda Express?  I have to admit: I first patronized this place because of the cute panda mascot.  Now, I find myself searching for PE when I want a quick Asian-style hit.  It is what it is and sometimes the food could be fresher.  BUT, if you know what you're getting and not expecting 5* authentic Chinese cuisine, then you'll probably be happy.	3	Panda Express	3
"Came here for a lunch with colleagues and ordered the creole chicken from the ""lighter menu"" (items are under 575 calories).  It was pretty good!  I was pleasantly surprised.  The last few times I visited GB, I was not impressed with the service or the food quality, given the prices and the hype (""meh"" food and servers who were obviously faking friendly service).  Our server was training a newbie, so the service wasn't stellar overall, but they tried to be upbeat and friendly.  One suggestion for the staff: if you know that a party is coming in for a work lunch, you may want to suggest separate checks from the get-go.  Most of the time, your customers will appreciate the gesture.

3* until my next visit proves otherwise."	3	Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant	3.5
Updated interior that looks quite nice!  I visited this Wendy's not too long ago as part of yet another bike ride.  What can one say about a fast-food restaurant, really?  Prices are inexpensive, especially the value menu, food is consistent with others in the same chain (as expected), and there are actually healthy options which eases the guilt in purchasing and consuming fast-food.  This Wendy's has a cool soda pop dispenser that elevates the acquisition of your carbonated beverage to quasi-video-game status...sort of.  The buttons on the interactive screen make it fun to get your drink, IMO, but I guess I'm just nerdy.  Anyway, I was happy to visit and refuel for the rest of my bike ride back to the west side of town.	3	Wendy's	3
Love this place! definite a rare gem of a restaurant on the East side! food is amazing and the owner Hide is so nice and welcoming. Must try the tonkutsu curry here!!	5	Oh Curry	4.5
We went here to use a coupon that the palazzo had given us for buy one get one house wine. When we asked about the coupon the bartender said that it was only for casino bars, which the coupon said nothing about. There were 10-15 people in the restaurant while we were there and at least 3 people working behind the bar, but it took 20 minutes for them to get us our drinks to go, even though all we ordered was wine. The cherry on top was that the pours were tiny. We may have been unlucky and gotten a bad bartender, but it was still a bad experience.	2	LAVO Italian Restaurant & Lounge	3.5
First time here and it is the cutest little restaurant ever. Had a very "homey" feel. And my peanut butter Belgium waffle was delicious. Cozy place, delicious waffles, and great service. You can't go wrong here! :)	5	Griddlecakes	3.5
UPSELL, UPSELL, UPSELL!  I went in the store for the $7.50 Italian beef sandwich and the fast-talking cashier said "you want mozzarella or provolone on that? would you like sweet peppers, how about hot peppers?  I told him I don't really like hot peppers, so he said, "ok. I'll put them on the side."   The end result was that whether I liked them or not, these are all "extras" and the final bill was over $10.  I consider this to be a disingenuous "Chicago hustle" and will not be returning.  Shame!  But, I only deducted one star for that issue.  The Italian beef, even with all the special condiments, was very average, only worth 3 stars.	2	Windy City Beefs N Dogs	4.5
Although this is not a gourmet restaurant, everything they served was a well-prepared and savory example of the item. We started with appetizers of meatballs wrapped in bacon and crunchy gnocchi, both delicious and unique. For entrees there was spaghetti with bacon served with chicken, a Philly cheesesteak sandwich and brie with turkey, again spot-on and flavorful. The location interior was a bit quirky, but in a compelling way-a cross between factory loft and grand ballroom. You'll see what I mean when you go inside. Server was attentive and friendly, owner came by to see about our experience, this restaurant is worth a try!	5	The Sparklings	4
I don't understand the great reviews.  The food is sloppy and overpriced or in the case of the fried foods, greasy and tasteless. The serving staff was untrained and inattentive. Let me give you a few examples:  the server brought the food to our party of six, one meal at a time, separated over a ten minute period; the waitress omitted an entree in placing the order so that one member of our group got the 2nd half of his meal after everyone else had finished; when the snow crab orders came, they were served without utensils with which to open them.and requests had to be made to supply them.  The food creates a pile of debris that nobody offered to remove until they were asked to do so.   There's a difference between "hip" or trendy and this do-it-yourself and you're on your own concept.  They definitely earned the  description as a "once-in-a-lifetime" experience!	2	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
John Lee, who already owns what I consider to be the best sushi restaurant in Las Vegas (Soho) has come up with an amazing fast-food concept in Jaburrito, a Mexican-Japanese-California fusion product that is absolutely amazing!  We had the Rockport and Kodiak, one sushi style wrapped in seaweed and the other with cooked salmon and cream cheese. (See photos). The flavors were unique and delicious.  Also try the taro chips with cheese.  This place has become my new (and healthful) lunch choice.	5	Jaburritos	4.5
Sometimes you write a review and it is painful to be honest about your experience, but in this case, I can offer superlatives without fear of contradiction.  Bar none, this is the best Indian cuisine in Las Vegas!  The surroundings were intriguing, overlooking the Strip and the airport runway, but believe me, once you bring that fork to your mouth, nothing else exists.  We had garlic chicken, the creamed spinach with cheese, Naan and the mixed grill.  Everything was perfectly prepared and savory.  Even the dessert was terrific.  Three entrees, naan, two glasses of wine and dessert for under $80, including tax.  It was only a Thursday night, but they also had a musician\/singer playing melodies in the background who was very talented.  The restaurant has only been open 3 1\/2 months, but it is already my favorite dining spot in Las Vegas.  A couple seated across from us was from California and had been there twice in three days.  They called Pure India better than any Indian restaurant in LA.  I can understand their enthusiasm!	5	Pure Indian Cuisine	4.5
French cafe with the obligatory ham and cheese on baguette turned out to be the best ham and cheese, ever!  I asked for extra butter and Dijon mustard on the side.  Love that European butter on the crispy crust authentic baguette.  A must try!	5	Eatt Gourmet Bistro	4.5
Great new neighborhood restaurant!  Especially convenient if you are doing "dinner and a movie" at the Regal Colonnade next door.  The dining atmosphere was upscale, the staff friendly and attentive.  The portions were ample, the pricing was fair, the menu was extensive and the presentation, artistic.  We started with warm, fresh crusty bread served with an olive oil tapenade.  Our entrees were the daily special, osso buco, the chicken Parm and the pasta with short rib.  All dishes were tasty and well-prepared.   Everything was superbly orchestrated under the watchful eye of Giuseppi, the owner.  Reservations recommended for weekend dining as this local gem has already been discovered.	5	Prosecco Fresh Italian Kitchen	4.5
4 plus stars, which is darn good for a chain.  Nice decor, good service an large tasty portions.  I had the $9.99 Chicken Chalupa lunch.   Most items on the menu are $12-$15.  It is definitely worth a try!  I have attached a photo of my entree.	4	Los Cucos Mexican Cafe	4
I reviewed this restaurant at the grand opening and thought it was excellent. I took my wife there for lunch today and was not disappointed. The store was very clean and comfortable.  Apparently, the Health Department had been there earlier in the day and the location had retained its A rating. Now for the food:  we both ordered combo platters for $10.88 each, that included rice or organic noodles, two regular entrees and a beverage. Appetizers can be substituted for entrees. Unlike Panda, the taste was not bland or overwhelmingly sweet.  The meat was tender and the vegetables fresh.  No dreaded MSG, only healthful organic ingredients, I really feel good about having lunch there!  We ordered the beef and broccoli, chicken wings, shrimp balls and noodles. I have included a photo below. I am very suspicious about the lower ratings given by a few others and would suspect they are written at the request of competitors.	5	ChiAm Restaurant	3
You've all heard about the dangers of "gas station sushi" but in this case, gas station\/car wash Mexican food is probably the best in Las Vegas.  A chef and manager efficiently turn out terrific Mexican favorites, all at a reasonable price.  While they only have a dozen stools, they do take out, too.  Not a romantic spot for a date, but you will fall in love with their food!   We had the chorizo plate and the carnitas plate, both served with rice and refried beans and choice of steaming corn or flour tortillas.  (both $8.95).  The sauces and flavors were authentic and savory.  Can't wait to go back...maybe the next time I need a car wash!	5	Chile Verde Express Mexican Grill	4.5
Authentic Mexican by family owners. Loved the pork and avocado sandwiches swimming in red broth. Mole poblano which was very good , is an acquired taste that may not be enjoyed as much by those expecting Americanized Mexican cuisine.  Try the roasted corn epizote  ( less messy when ordered off the cob.) If you wanted a truly tasty Mexican meal made by "su abuela's" loving hands, this is the place!	4	Las Cazuelas	4.5
I had previously reviewed this restaurant and gave it five stars.  The second time, a Sunday evening, not so much.  The great, the good and the bad:  The Great: Calamari appetizer, very tender ($9);  Great filet mignon, done perfectly, ($40) delicious. The Good:  Beet and arugula salad ($8), large portion, enough for two.  The Bad:  Salmon and Peas pasta (highly recommended by the waiter) very salty smoked salmon, in sauce lacking flavor, all in a thick doughy pasta ($28) inedible; Italian wedding cake, excellent the last time was tasteless this time, perhaps old;   the "service":  the waiter was attentive at first but then disappeared,  The busboy definitely lacked training.  When clearing the dishes he spilled some of the steak sauce on the table in front of my wife and made no effort to clean it up, leaving a large spot for the remainder of the meal.  He served coffee and never asked if a refill was desired.  He cleared the dishes from our table and an adjacent table on a large tray directly in front of our table.  Definitely not first class!  I would add that this time the manager never stopped by our table to inquire about our meals, which he did on the last occasion.  I was totally disappointed this time in comparison with the previous visit and would have to think twice about going there again.	3	Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse	4.5
"Ordered two pizzas, one came out fine after which the waiter repeatedly said ""your other pizza will be coming right out.""  But after 20 minutes of announcements of the pizza's imminent arrival, I finally called the waiter over to tell him there was obviously a problem. The second pizza order was apparently misplaced by the manager and was never made. The pizza arrived another 10 minutes later and the manager came by to say he would ""make things right."" At that point the people in our party who had ordered the second pizza did not want to have the rest of us who had already finished their meal wait for them, and only ate one slice each leaving half the pizza. 

The bill came and for the manager ""making things right"" was to remove the charge for the second pizza. To me that would have been the starting point, since the meal had been ruined for everyone. 

Four stars for the pizza and zero stars for an incompetent manager and indifferent waiter."	2	Grimaldi's Pizzeria	4
This used to be the old Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, so the interior appointments were elegant.  I understand the business only recently opened, but it was Saturday night in Vegas and the town was packed , but at 8 pm the place was nearly empty.  We ordered the kale salad with lemon vinegrette, excellent, and a fois gras appetizer, tender, rich and delicious.  The main course was a chicken parm, well-prepared, but did not have much in the way of Italian marinara flavor. It was more like a pan fried piece of chicken with melted cheese.  ($26).  Everything here is a la carte, so it didn't even come with a side dish of pasta. Service was very good , but my overall impression of the restaurant was "overpriced" and "good," but not excellent under Las Vegas standards.	4	Toscano Italian Steakhouse	4
A new addition to SoHo's offerings:  an excellent "happy hour" menu served until 6 pm. Asahi Draft ($3), Coors Light ($1.50) and an array of great appetizers.  Even though we over-indulged, we still came back to our favorites: yellow tail and sunny salmon (see photos). The absolute best!	5	Soho Japanese Restaurant	4.5
Saw this on yelp and would say that that the food was definitely worth the rating. Had the grilled chicken sandwich. The chicken breast was thick, moist and tender, served with pineapple and a special tangy sauce.  I also ordered the Rumbi fries which is a combination of regular and sweet potato fries served with Russian dressing. All in all, very good, prompt and friendly service.  About $8.85 for meal, excluding beverage.	4	Rumbi Island Grill	4
What a little jewel!  Big Al's, inside the Orleans has great fresh seafood (oysters, king crab, salmon and crawfish) plus the best clam chowder (white or red) in town.  Sit at the counter and watch them cook these specialities!  The service was prompt and the staff friendly with the warmest greeting coming from Lisa, the hostess.  Neighborhood prices at a resort hotel was quite the bargain!	5	Big Al's Oyster Bar	3.5
I had previously reviewed ChiAm's first location at Jones and Craig shortly after opening.  I saw the Charleston location, and decided to give it a try.  The business is hard to see from the street, but right across from the Community College.  It was noon, but the business had few customers.  Nonetheless, based upon the excellent experience at the other store, I ordered the $8.88 combo.  Noodles, rice or vegetables plus 2 protein entrees.  I had the mandarin chicken and the beef with broccoli...then waited 10-15 minutes.   Everything was made to order, but worth the wait.   Piping hot, large quantities of very tasty food rivaling the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas.  Quality ingredients make it really stand out against Panda (my opinion).  I posted a photo of my order with this review.	5	ChiAm Restaurant	3.5
"I would have give MOzen four stars for a snafu in the service...had it not been New Years Eve when everything is crazy.  We waited about 40 minutes before a server brought by the small, obligatory bread basket, and then 10 minutes later some of the sushi dishes we had ordered as appetizers, finally began to arrive.  They delivered two at once, one of which we didn't recall ordering.  When we were barely getting started on the sushi, the main course arrived.  I sent that back to the kitchen to keep warm while we hurriedly ate what was in front of us.  We were surprised when the correct sushi order arrived, followed a few minutes later by the main entrees, again.  We never got to finish the late-delivered sushi, and frankly, three sushi orders were more than we intended to eat.  The restaurant manager came by to offer us a glass of champagne, on the house, but we were already drinking a very good cabernet, so we declined,

The good part is that everything we tried, was excellent!  The sushi was very good.  We had yellow tail and yellow tail sushi rolls and also the ""caterpillar"" roll.  (Note:  the best yellow tail in town is at SoHo, a small local west end eatery).  For entrees, we tried the butter chicken in curry sauce, served with basmati rice and freshly made nan.  It was spicy and hauntingly flavorful and well-prepared. The second entree was the lamb shank also in a curry sauce and the same side dishes, but had an entirely different curry flavor:  savory, tender and delicious.  We plan to return when the restaurant is in a less hectic setting, but overall, it was one of the better-tasting meals we had at a Las Vegas resort hotel."	5	MOzen Bistro	4
My lady was hungry for crab legs, and a trip to the "real" Joe's Crabs" at Caesars with its luxury tax price tag was too excessive for mid-week dining and the chain "Joe's Crab Shack" is simple awful, so we checked Yelp and found Fish King Grill!   They didn't have King Crab, but Snow Crab legs were amazing, perfectly done, ample portions and reasonably priced.  I had the grilled shrimp kabobs with home-made Cole slaw and hush puppies, also excellent.  This local neighborhood diner is worth a try.  Staff was very helpful and the dining area was immaculate.	5	Fish King Grill	4.5
"Best Indian Lunch Buffet in Las Vegas!

This place has been open for about a year, but as you can see has already received accolades from over 200 Yelpers. I was introduced to this restaurant by my Indian friend who assured me it was the best in town. For $10.99 (or for that matter at any price) this lunch buffet is outstanding. It has a 35 display of savory meats and vegetables from traditional tandoori chicken to a goat stew. Admittedly, passed on the goat, but everything else was great, including the desserts. A complimentary freshly-baked nan (garlic or plain) comes with each order.  Spacious and clean and an A Health Department rating completes the offering."	5	Delhi Indian Cuisine	4
"Real crap tasting food , burgers were rare . Almost bloody .

"I was going to take hubby out to a pizza place last night.  When I checked yelp again to confirm directions, my eye noticed a NEW REVIEW NEAR YOU.  Yup, Hummus Bar.  Cool.  Let's go there instead!

The interior is nothing spectacular and the menu is small, both good signs to me (i.e., the focus is - hopefully! - on the food).  We ordered the hummus and falafel combo and the hummus-2 skewers-in a pita combo.  Both were fantastic and made to order using very fresh ingredients.  Smooth, creamy hummus, crunchy-on-the-outside falafel, and lots of fresh veggies in the pita sandwich.  As other reviewers have stated, there is a small salad bar that features traditional Israeli salads.  Most of them were on the spicy side (reminiscent in a way of kimchi, to me) and all were flavourful.

The chef appeared a bit surly at first, all no-nonsense and what-do-you-want-already, but after telling him it was our first time there and that we really liked our meal, he seemed to open up.  Our chef told us that the Hummus Bar has only been open for about 7 months (he's been cooking all his life, however).  Also, he is passionate about food quality; he said that ""other places use chicken that smells funny"".....he goes several steps further and washes his chicken with vinegar and lemon juice to ""make sure they are clean and good.  You will see my chicken breasts are not tough, yes?""  Yes.

Chef also convinced us to try the ""cold dessert""....I asked him what it was called, to which he responded ""cold dessert.""  :)  It was quite good: a spongy cake soaked in a rum sauce (I think) topped with whipped cream and a cherry.  Hubby ate most of it, as I was stuffed.

Portions are large, prices are reasonable enough, and service is fine, although you may want to engage the chef in food talk to really get him smiling.  We'll come here again soon to try the other types of hummus."	4	Hummus Bar	4
Huge portions where spicy really does mean spicy!  We dropped in for a quick dinner and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  We were not as impressed by our sticky table top.  However, the staff is friendly, the service is fast, and the prices are affordable.	4	China One - West Charleston	3.5
"I like this location as it's close to home and the library!  Went here the other night and stuffed myself silly.  There were 3 of us and it was around 6pm and the place was hopping.  We waited for about 30 minutes, which is short, and were seated by the perky hostess.  All our tapas were great and flavourful; on this visit, our favourites included the padron peppers (mild), the bacon-wrapped dates (because anything in bacon is great), and the tortilla a la espanola.  We also enjoyed the sangria and dessert (lemon tarts and chocolate-cherry bread pudding).  Our server was fantastic and attentive without being insincere!

Come out for a good time and some great nibbles."	4	Firefly	4
Funny how I've brought numerous friends and family members here to ogle the chocolate fountain, but have never eaten anything here.  I met a friend here for breakfast and was utterly satisfied.  My salmon bagel -- while nothing fancy or extremely decadent -- was toasted and served to me with a smile.  The salmon was mainly raw and very lightly smoked, I believe, and tasty while the accompanying dill sauce was light,savoury, and delightful with the grape tomatoes.  My friend easily consumed her Quiche Lorraine without any complaints.  Great service, great food, and beautiful pastries all beckon me to come again.  Next time I'll try the crêpes and\/or a chocolate goodie.	4	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
Went here on a whim (July 5, 2011) after dropping off some shoes to be repaired a few doors down.  I am a baked goods fiend and had heard of this bakery but kept forgetting to visit.  I'm glad I did!  The selection wasn't huge, as the holiday was the previous day, but what they did have looked fresh and homey.  I bought a loaf of the 3-seed bread and it proved to be fresh and not full of sugar and other crap.  The nice lady behind the counter said that they don't like to use a lot of sugar and that they like to keep things healthy (at least for their bread...).  Value seemed pretty good as my very heavy loaf was ~$5.50.  The bread is still fresh the day after purchase.  I will come here again and often for the bread and to sample some pastries.	5	German Bread Bakery	4.5
"My husband surprised me by taking me here a couple of nights ago and I was quite impressed.  He wanted to find a steakhouse that 1) was NOT on the Strip and 2) was NOT going to render us penniless.  He succeeded on both counts.  I enjoyed the lovely interior, the good humoured server (Susan), and most of all, the fantastic food.  Hubby ordered a 16 oz prime NY steak while I chose the 8 oz filet mignon off of the classic menu.  Tip: that classic menu has got to be one of the best-kept secrets in Vegas.  Bread basket, salad, entree, and 2 sides for $30 or less?  Wow.  Every bite was delish.  My steak had a buttery mouthfeel, my mashed potatoes were very smooth and creamy, and my steamed broccolini was just right.  We split a piece of chocolate oreo cake to end the evening and left feeling completely stuffed.

Our server gave us a 'buy one, get one free entree' coupon, which only confirmed our enthusiasm for this place.  Next visit is to check out their happy hour...."	5	Twin Creeks	4
"Came here with hubby to check out the happy hour and were greeted by a very perky hostess.  I've been to Tivoli Village many times and have observed that it has never been busy.  Walking into B&B was no different.  I wasn't sure how to describe the vibe: there is a regular bar in the middle of the restaurant, a milkshake bar on the left side upon entering, and red booths occupying the rest of the interior space.  Four flat screen TV's beam down sports games for those inclined to watch.  Is this place a bar, a restaurant, a brewpub??

Our server was nice enough and suggested we try the sampler appy plate, as it is large enough to share.  He was right!  Our appy sampler included 2 pulled pork sliders, 2 regular sliders (these were subbed for the wings, as they ran out of the wings), one Mexican hotdog (sour cream\/avocado\/jalapeno peppers), fries (soggy and a bit cold), and half a dozen risotto balls (deep fried....so good but so bad for you!).  Hubby ordered the DH draft for $2 and pronounced it ""really good!""  Yeah, it actually was pretty good (I'm a non-beer drinker, so that's a big compliment).  

The food all tasted great, with the exception of the fries, which were cold and limp.  Not too impressive.  Overall, I think B&B really wants you to like it, but can't decided how to market itself.  Would I come again?  Maybe, if only to see if the fries are hot!"	3	Bottles & Burgers By Double Helix	3
Pretty good cup o' joe and scrumptious looking pastries (sadly, I didn't partake).  The vibe is funky and artsy and cool; I felt like a hipster upon entering!  Nice folks and a comfy atmosphere are highly appreciated by this gal.  Free wifi is also a plus but like others have noted, the wifi is limited to a few hours' worth of surfing the internetz.	4	MadHouse Coffee	4
"I've been here 3 times in the past 4 days.  Why have I not visited earlier?  C&S is adorable and cosy and charming, offering sweet sophistication to those of us on the westside.  I've sampled a lemon tart, red velvet cake, chocolate biscotti, lemon-scented vanilla cake, apple pie, raspberry pie, banana cream tart, and blueberry scone.  (N.B.  My exercise level has increased dramatically this past week!)  All were fantastic and fresh and fruity and yummy.  The icings on the cake aren't too sweet and the pastry is flaky and light.  My turkey sandwich last night was savoury and sweet at the same time!  That apricot jam complements the turkey and cheese nicely.  If you don't want pastries or ""real food,"" there is always the gelato case with 8 different flavours of dairy decadence or the chocolate\/bonbon case with its array of temptations.  

Service has always been with a smile.  :)  Just GO if you haven't already!"	5	Rolling in Dough Cafe	4
"4 stars for great service and cute interior.  My hiking group decided to stop here after our successful summit for some drinks and quesadillas and we were incredibly happy to quench our thirst.  Our server was sweet and the drinks cold.  The quesadillas were all right: nothing offensive, just not overwhelming.  

Kind of kitschy, but both tourists and locals will enjoy the atmosphere and the lovely patio with hummingbirds hovering by the multiple bird feeders.  :)"	4	Mt. Charleston Lodge	3.5
"I came here for the first time earlier tonight after a long day of rehearsals.  (Yeah, it's taken me *this* long to check this place out!)  I was sober and very hungry and thus, enjoyed my Hawaiian sandwich very very much.  I thought that: 

1) there was a lot of ham and chicken in my sandwich
2) the bread had that 'just baked' feel - crispy\/crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside
3) the sauce was tangy and oh-so-good!

I felt like I ate a Hawaiian pizza!  YUM.  I also thought my accompanying chocolate chip cookie was delicious.  (I bought a country apple muffin for my hubby and he *just* devoured it, pronouncing the muffin as ""hey, that was really good!."")

One of the more affordable options on the Strip and dang, why is there only one location in Vegas, let alone NV?  If you're ever around Planet Hollywood and want a cheapish bite, visit EoS!"	4	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"J'adore le pain....et les biscuits....et les gateaux....et les croissants....

Great French bakery that serves up goodies with a smile.  La Belle Terre offers artisan breads, pastries, and ""real food"" (quiche, sandwiches, soups) with flair.  On my maiden visit a few days ago, I sampled the ""Normand"" sandwich (turkey breast, Brie, apple, walnuts) and it was very good.  The bread tasted like it came out of the oven a few hours ago: chewy, soft, yeasty, yum.  I also enjoyed the Baby Rasta, an original chocolate meringue cookie sandwich topped with (vanilla) meringue ""dreadlocks"".  Magnifique!  For takeaway, I selected a few macarons (blueberry and passion fruit), chocolate chip cookies, and a cranberry roll.  All were gone far too quickly!

I am returning to try the quiche.  :)

If you haven't already, pay a visit to La Belle Terre.  You'll enter and exit with a smile on your face because how can anyone be sad in a bakery?"	5	La Belle Terre Bread French Bakery Café	4
"Very friendly service and lovely food.  We got the garlic naan, lamb curry, okra, and paneer mahkni.  Sauces were tasty and all was delicious.  The rice pudding with blueberry topping was DIVINE.  I'm lactose intolerant and ate nearly everything myself.  Holy cow.  Yeah, no kidding, the 'best rice pudding in the world.'  I concur.

Difficult to locate this place if you don't know where to look.  It's in the strip mall directly west of the Panda Express on Sahara.  The exterior isn't anything to write home about, but the interior is tastefully decorated and smells wonderful.

I want more rice pudding!!"	4	Samosa Factory	4
"The first thing that impressed me was that Soyo isn't an AYCE place.  Not that AYCE places are bad!  I've just visited places that boast AYCE and the quality just falls under my (snobby) standards.  Soyo is super cute on the inside, with twinkling lights, a ""Price is Right"" style spinning wheel, and signs in Hangul (and we all know that printed Hangul is super cute, what with all the ""sticks and circles"" --hubby's words -- in that particular written language!). 

Our party of 4 snagged a booth and ordered a variety of delights: bibimbap, fried chicken, chapchae, etc.  Barley tea was flowing liberally, the banchan was plentiful and tasty, and hubby got his fill of kimchi to last for the next few weeks.  Everything was delicious and the sweet, if slightly clueless server, was more than happy to bring us drink refills and napkins (after reminding him several times).  It was nice not to have our clothes saturated with bbq smoke after our meal, something that is a given at AYCE bbq places I've patronized.  

I will definitely come here again to eat and to spin that wheel!"	4	Soyo Korean Barstaurant	4
"Cheap, fast, tasty burgers with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.  What more do you want?  Well, I would like salt on the fries, but it's not that much of a pain to add the salt myself.  I guess.....

I've always had friendly service, even when dithering between menu options!"	4	In-N-Out Burger	4
"Went here for a casual dinner with new friends after helping them with church stuff.  Mimi's was nearby and I was curious about it, since I'd never been there before.  The interior is cosy and could be described as a mashup between 1920s Paris and early 20th century New Orleans.  Casual and comfy.  I ordered the ""light"" tilapia with steamed veggies and brown rice: nothing spectacular, but I wanted a light meal and was craving some fish.  My husband had the chicken crepes, which were heavy and ""too creamy.""  He also thought that the salad came with too much dressing.  Our dining companions all had the French onion soup and various accompaniments (fries, sliders, salad).

Not sure what was ""French"" about most of the menu....""French fries"" and ""French onion soup"" isn't ""French.""  To me, anyway....

Our server was very friendly and accommodating.  Nice gal.

Mimi's won't be a go-to spot for me, as I like my restaurants to have that bit of pizzazz and spice, both literally and figuratively.  I don't often cite chain restaurants as go-to places and would much rather check out hole-in-the-wall joints and mom-and-pop eateries.  However, I am open to trying out mainstream establishments, if only to appease the tastes and comfort levels of friends!"	3	Mimi's Cafe	3
"i really enjoyed my first visit here and was impressed with the gent behind the counter (I think he is one of the owners?).  He was quick to offer us a gluten-free\/vegan\/veggie menu, as I said I couldn't ingest dairy.  During our meal, he came by and asked if we were happy with everything (we were).  I ended up ordering the lentil soup and the Plato's Potatoes (i.e., fries topped with a secret spice blend).  The soup was delicious, but the fries were so-so (I thought the accompanying yogurt dip was too yogurt-y and the fries on their own were surprisingly bland).  I also ordered a few of the butter cookies, which proved to be a good decision.  Lovely, shortbread-like cookies dusted with confectioner's sugar.

The place is clean and bright and is great for a casual meal with friends.  You make your order at the counter, pay, take a number, find a seat, then wait for your meal to be brought to you.  It's like a very upscale cafeteria!

I'm happy that there is a unique place like MGC in the north part of town."	4	Market Grille Cafe	4
"This place is a little family-owned and operated restaurant tucked away into a strip mall just across from UNLV.  It's very unpretentious from the outside, but the inside!  Immaculate interior, sweet staff, and Hello Kitty curtains separating the kitchen area from the front counter area!  TV's featuring Korean pop are on pretty much all the time and there is even a computer with free internet access in the back of the restaurant.  The bathroom is one of the cutest I've ever seen: again, immaculate, and boasting a mid-purple tone on the upper half of the walls with white tiles on the lower half.  Black and white tiles form a checkerboard pattern on the floor and gilt mirrors are above the sink and on the opposite wall.  (I know, it's weird to describe a bathroom, but it really made an impression on me.  And, it is really cute.)

The food: order from the Korean part of the menu.  I've only ever had the Korean food and it's always good.  Yes, it's pricier, but the portions are generous and everything is made to order.  I had the daeji bulgogi (bbq-ed pork) and the hubby had the kimchi dolsot bibimbap.  Both were sizzling hot and tasty.  Hubby particularly enjoyed the ""crispy bits of rice"" in his dish.

If you're looking for a different place for lunch whilst on campus, come enjoy a more relaxing atmosphere here that's literally across the street from the chaos that is UNLV."	4	Teriyaki Time	3.5
"I do NOT have a gluten intolerance.

That said, I am always open to sampling baked goods of all sorts, including gluten-free goodies.  Beau Monde has been in the back of my head for a LONG time for two reasons: 1) it's a bakery!, 2) it's been recommended by several of my gluten-intolerant students.

Ok.  Finally got a chance to stop here first thing in the morning a couple of days ago and WOW.  The interior is so cute and the display of baked goods stopped me in my tracks.  What to choose???  After much deliberation, I selected a piece of carrot cake, a caramel iced cupcake, and a package of snickerdoodles.  All were fabulous and yes, they didn't ""taste like they were gluten-free.""  [I ate all but 2 of the snickerdoodles MYSELF that day, piggie that I am.]  The cake was moist and topped with a delectable cream cheese frosting.  The cupcake was soft and cakey in the best way possible with enough icing to satisfy my sweet tooth but not too much like other cupcakes (as in, would you like some cupcake with that icing?).  The cookies had a nice crunch and were satisfyingly spiced with cinnamon and other lovely things.

I am happy that there is a FANTASTIC bakery option for my GF (and non GF) friends in this city.  I want to try the bread and see if that's as good as I think.  The prices are a little higher than normal, but since the ingredients are a bit more specialized, that's ok.  

In case it wasn't obvious, I am coming back for more.  :)"	5	Beau Monde Bakery	4
"Went here today for the first time for a group lunch....also marked my first visit to a Vegas buffet ever.  (Yeah, so what??)  Since it's summer, the place wasn't busy at all, but I can imagine it could be other times of the year.  Price is good: show your NV ID for a 50% discount (lunch was about $9\/person after discount).

Place is huge, non-alcoholic drinks and refills are included in the price, and the food offerings are organized by ethnic cuisine: American (chicken-fried steak, mashed potatoes, fries, etc.), Asian (noodle station, teppenyaki station, westernized Chinese food...), Italian (pasta and cheese....), etc.  Food quality is pretty good for a buffet and the number of choices plentiful.  (I can't comment on anything with dairy as I can't eat that, boo).  I was disappointed with the dessert section, first for the number of treats I could not have due to the disturbing (to me!) dairy -- those particular sweets included mini custard tarts with whipped cream, a gelato bar, and cheesecakes.  I did sample a slice of cherry pie (good but not extremely fresh tasting), the (soupy) peach cobbler, and a little square of bland chocolate cake that could have used more cocoa.

I would come here again for a value priced lunch if I were in the area.  Not my first choice, as I'd rather patronize off-strip locales, but I was glad to shed my buffet virginity....so to speak!"	3	Carnival World Buffet	3.5
"According to yelp, 3 stars = ""A-OK.""  This place, for me, is exactly that because it's cheap, convenient, and surprisingly tasty.  How much can you expect from a bean burrito that is $0.99?  Not much, right?  Well, here at Del Taco, the beans are slow-cooked from scratch.  They're not a mushy mess.  Hubby likes the strawberry shakes -- there's REAL ice cream in them things! -- and the chili cheese fries (cardiac arrest on a plate, but you only live once).  It's a great option after a hike, when you're ravenous and want calories NOW.  

I've never experienced less-than-friendly service and you can get as much hot sauce as you want!"	3	Del Taco	3
So good.  Not super cheap for a food court, but the quality is better than a typical food court.  Per usual, large portions and made to order.  What more can I say?  ;)	4	Island Style Restaurant	3.5
"My husband surprised me with dinner here after a very eventful day.  Upon entering the restaurant, decked out in what I call ""French boudoir-meets-contemporary-flair,"" we were seated at a lovely and comfortable booth.  Service was really good all evening: unobtrusively attentive, if that makes sense.  The first thing we tried was the pretzel basket with mustard butter; apparently, we were pretty hungry, as those suckers were gone immediately.  Our server asked us if we wanted more, to which we said 'yes.'  (Hey, it was my birthday!)  We shared the berry salad, which was full of strawberries and pecans and definitely large enough to split.  For our entrées, we chose the Chilean sea bass and the roasted Scottish salmon, both of which were cooked perfectly.  I particularly enjoyed the brown butter sauce that encircled the sea bass -- creamy, buttery goodness.  

I normally select chocolate cake for dessert, but I had pie on the brain because 1) it was ""pi"" day and 2) I really like pie.  Our server actually dissuaded us from the chocolate cake because we were already pretty full and he didn't think we could fit one piece into our already-swollen selves.  He pointed to the cake and we were pretty impressed -- and scared -- that we could see all 7 layers from 30 feet away.  Thus, I chose the apple pie, which was warm, fruity, and spicy all encased in buttery, flaky pastry.  

All in all, my experience was excellent and my dinner was lovely.  I would like to check out Society's brunch to compare experiences!"	5	Society Cafe Encore	4
"I finally got a chance to visit this hidden gem a couple of days ago and was not disappointed.  I had a bit of time before an evening rehearsal, so I wended my way to the rather nondescript entrance and was cheerily greeted by the nice server.  It was happy hour when I arrived, but I was the only patron there.  (20% off all food during HH!)  I was super hungry and craving a steak....lo and behold, there was a filet mignon on the menu.  Sold.  My medium rare steak was juicy and tender and infused with a balsamic-cabernet reduction -- YUM.  The accompanying rice and side salad (delicious lime vinaigrette dressing) were also good: light, fresh, and polite enough to yield center stage to the steak.  

The interior of 28GO was designed by the chef and from the look of it, I know I'd like this person.  Funky, a touch of geeky, with a good splash of humour, this little restaurant is one I hope succeeds beyond its wildest dreams.  I enjoyed seeing the various board games on the bar top, as well as the beautiful Asian-inspired art inlaid into the same.

I am returning to check out the actual tapas menu.....maybe even tonight!  :)"	5	28GO The Restaurant	4
"A solid place to grab a quick lunch, drink, or snack in between classes.  This Einsteins is located inside the Science and Engineering building, right across from Ham Hall, and is reasonably quiet (at least whenever I've visited).  Service is usually good, from what I've experienced.

The con: they're usually out of whole wheat bagel thins!  Come early to snag one."	3	Einstein Bros	2.5
"I had high hopes for this place.  After reading the yelp reviews and online menu, I made a reservation for 4 for Friday night (3\/11\/2011).  My party was initially impressed with the lovely (man-made) lake view and the talented jazz guitarist\/vocalist.  Unfortunately, our initial impression was marred by several factors:

1) we had a long wait for our dinner (45 min)
2) my order was incorrect
3) our blonde server was not really attentive (she did not ask us how our food was....she didn't ask if we wanted coffee or tea with our dessert order!)

On the plus side, the view is lovely.  My meal was complimentary due to the kitchen's error.  The food and wine were wonderful.  I would come here again to see if the service would be better.  For a first-time visit, however, this was a little disappointing, especially since the prices are on the expensive side.  Aren't pricier restaurants supposed to ensure quality of food AND service?  Marché Bacchus has a lot of potential for consistent 5-star ratings....y'all have the food, wine, and view part down....now, work on your wait staff!"	3	Marché Bacchus	3.5
"I really like the food.  Housemade tortillas and fresh ingredients!  Portions are quite generous and service was pretty friendly.  What I do not like: sneaky upcharges.  I ordered the pork barbacoa last night and when asked if I wanted my hot sauce ""enchilada style,"" I said yes.  I mean, the more sauce the better, right?  Well, apparently spooning extra sauce over a burrito is hard work that equals a dollar.  Yup, getting your burrito ""enchilada style"" will cost you a buck.  I only learned that upon reading my receipt.  Apparently, there are other upcharges, like requesting sour cream, guac, etc.  I'm guessing that any innocuous question posed by a staff member hides an upcharge.  Just say no, kids.  Or, buyer beware.  

Also keep in mind that if you're a hands-on type of eater, you may have to develop knife and fork skills to eat here.  Not a dealbreaker in my book, but may be a shock to some folks!

3* for sneakiness."	3	Cafe Rio	3
First time here and ordered the Bobbie, Thanksgiving dinner on a bun (turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayo).  Bread was fresh and everything was seasoned nicely.  We got the medium size (12") and wow, it must have weighed about 2 pounds!  Plenty of food for myself and my hubby.  We were the only ones in the shop at the time, so our order was processed pretty quickly.  I don't know how busy this place gets, but I believe one should phone in one's order to save time.  Something I noticed: the floors were a little bit dirty, not so much to dissuade me from trying a sandwich, but just enough to wonder why it wasn't cleaner, especially when there was time and opportunity to attend to it?  I'll come here again to try a different sandwich....and to see if the floor's cleaner.  :)	4	Capriotti's Sandwich Shop	3.5
"I've driven by this coffee shop\/bar many times as I work in this area and have promised myself to check it out ""soon.""  Well, it's been longer than ""soon,"" but shorter than ""never,"" so here is my first impression!  

I didn't get coffee or alcohol today as I needed to rehydrate and replenish before teaching impressionable kids music.  I picked up a black-and-white cookie and a Sanpellegrino Limonata and sat down to focus my thoughts on lesson ideas.  The cookie was good; I learned that The Lodge orders baked goods from Great Buns Bakery every day.  Yay for local businesses helping each other out!  The interior is nice and boasts plenty of wood: chairs, tables, and counter area all feature pretty shades of brown.  I liked the ""homey chic"" quality to the place.  What I didn't like: 1) the smoke in the air and 2) the slot machines.  I get that this is Vegas, but really, is it necessary to have casino artifacts everywhere?  

Service was pleasant, the place was clean, and the menu items looked pretty good.  Review update to follow on next visit, but until then, this place rates 3* from me."	3	The Lodge Coffee House & Tavern	4
I've been a fair number of times for lunch with work colleagues and service has always been good.  Today's service was on the slow side -- maybe the back to school business lunch people surprised the staff?  Anyhow, I ordered a cup of the lentil soup -- wonderful! -- and a side of the Athens fries (French fries with "Greek" seasoning).  Fries = comfort food to me and are pretty hard to mess up, so of course I inhaled them.  I like the casual atmosphere, the large number of vegetarian options, and relatively inexpensive prices.  Perhaps not the most "authentic" place to get Mediterranean food, but it's cheap-ish and reliable and generous with the portions.	4	Paymon's Mediterranean Cafe & Lounge	4
"Finally dragged out my hubby and what?  I didn't have ANY idea that they roasted their own beans under the name Mothership Coffee Roasters.  On our visit this morning, the place was packed and buzzing with caffeinated conversation.  We grabbed a couple of seats at the long table by the front door and started chatting with our table mates; this is something that other coffee places in Vegas don't have or encourage IMO.  

My latte was lovely, creamy, and smooth while hubby's espresso was ""better than Sambalatte's.""  We wanted to buy a pound of espresso beans, but were told that they wouldn't have any to sell until 9am the next morning.  ""That's too bad,"" we bemoaned, ""as we live on the complete other side of town.""  To our complete delight, Mikey said he'd bag a pound for us right then and there.  And he did!  And we bought!  And now we're at home ready to indulge once again. 

Thank you for going out of your way for us, Sunrise.  See you soon!"	5	Sunrise Coffee	4.5
This is our go-to place for Thai take out.  They're friendly, food is fast and great tasting.  If you like papaya salad, Laos style is my fav and so flavorful.  Everything from your usual, Pad Thai or Spicy Basil Chicken, it's always good.	5	Basil 'n Lime	3.5
"My visiting family and I checked out this new men's clothier a couple of days ago and were quite impressed by the offerings.  Designed for the discerning male who wants both style and comfort with a touch of flair, Lindbergh opened about three weeks ago in Downtown Summerlin and is the first US location.  Many of the very young and trendily attired salespeople were happy to chat to us about the current 50% sale and how much they liked the clothes.  They may not know much about their stock (yet), but they are earnest and willing to find information for you.  Prices are not cheap, but the aforementioned 50% sale makes things a bit more reasonable (I bought a dress shirt for my FIL about $70 after the discount was applied).  Sizes are given in both European and US measurements -- Lindbergh is a Danish brand -- but just ask if you're confused about how the conversion works.  

One of the more curious fixtures in the store is the kosher hot dog cart that greets you at the front.  I spoke with the girl who was managing it and she admitted that it was a little odd, especially since the hot dogs had nothing to do with the clothing or the cafe that is on the ground floor (no, hot dogs are not on the menu!).

This is probably going to be fairly popular with those who want to don unique, stylish clothing.  I may have found a new place to procure surprises for the sartorially-minded men in my life!"	4	Lindbergh & Lindbergh Cafe	3.5
A&A (hmm....that's a bit too close to another acronym that's associated with ales...intentional?) has the right idea.  It's conveniently located for those of us in the NW part of town and offers a good selection of beers not found easily at other watering holes in town.  We came here on a Tuesday night, found seats in the patio area, and quickly found the ambience rather loud, largely due to the trivia night shenanigans going on inside.  Our group had to shout to "communicate" with each other; this was rather disappointing when we were all sitting at the same table.  It would have been nice if the PA system was off during our visit; we felt like we were forced to participate in the surround-sound trivia game because we literally could not escape it!  On the bright side, the food was good and service was pleasant and my company was congenial.  Beer prices seemed high; for instance, my husband ordered the Green Flash Stout, which came in a smaller-than-usual glass (not a full pint, perhaps half a pint?) and was $8 (before tip and tax).  I'll have to check out Tenaya Brewing Company up the street to compare brews and prices.	3	Aces & Ales	4
Very impressed with the waffle sandwiches. Fries were meh, but enjoyed the experience overall!	5	Bruxie	4.5
Tofu stew!  Bulgogi!  Banchan!  Great Korean food in a little mom-and-pop type of eatery in a little shopping plaza.  Super clean interior and super friendly service makes for a delightful dinner in my book.  The quality and quantity of everything we ordered was wonderful; everything was flavourful and spicy hot (we requested a '7' on their spicy scale).  There was so much food we had enough leftovers for two meals.  We are definitely coming back to sample more stews and inhale more Korean bbq!	5	Mashisoyo	4
I can't say anything different from the many other yelpers who have waxed eloquent about this delightful eatery.  Service was fast and friendly, the place was super clean, and the food was "party in the mouth" yummy.  Our bulgogi was perfect, the sundubu was spicy and filling, and the various banchan both appeased and teased our appetites.  Check it out!	5	Mr Tofu	3.5
Came here for the lunch buffet (~$11) and left satisfied.  The place was moderately busy and had a nice selection of the usual buffet selections.  There weren't as many veggie options as I would have liked, but the options offered were all pretty fresh and not overspiced.  Our server was nicely attentive and unobtrusive, refilling water glasses with a smile.  This place served as a welcome oasis to begin the new school year.	4	India Masala Bar & Grill	4
Went here today for the first time and left happy.  I'm a relative newcomer to Sin City and am always satisfied when I try a new eatery with great results.  I had the lunch buffet and everything was fresh, tasty, and colourful without any nasty aftertaste (something I've experienced at other ethnic places).  My favourite dishes included the goat tikka masala and the saag paneer....the chutney was pretty good too, especially on top of the naan.  :) For about $12+tax, one can eat his or her fill of nicely spiced Indian food that is heavy on flavour and light on the grease.  Both vegetarians and carnivores have plenty of options with which to fill their bellies!  I plan on coming back again soon to try the dinner menu....	5	India Palace	4
This Yard House in the Linq is definitely trendy and a solid option for food and drink when you're in the area.  The space is huge -- is it the largest YH in the country? -- and the beer list is impressively thorough.  Food is generally well done and satisfies most cravings anyone would have.  I have noticed in the past year that service is hit-or-miss, regardless of which location I've visited.  I frequent the Red Rock Casino location a lot and some days, the servers are fantastic: observant, personable, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  Other times, it's difficult to get the person's attention.  Each time I've dropped by the Linq YH, I've been underwhelmed by my service.  I don't believe that I'm a demanding diner, but I do expect to be acknowledged within 5-10 minutes of being seated and to receive a smile or two.  However, working in the service industry can be trying at the best of times, so I'm willing to give people some slack.	3	Yard House	4
Nice environment with an upstairs small library. Great place to catch up with morning activities. I had an iced coffee and a ham and cheese croissant. Great portions even tho it was a little pricey $16 for both. Great place.	3	Sambalatte Torrefazione	4
Gone twice now to both locations now and all I can say is wow. I love the food. The Pabellon is a must. Meat sweet plantains black beans all good stuff. Order a side of the yuka fries and pork rinds. Make sure to grab the bottle green sauce and hot sauce they have behind the counter.	5	Viva Las Arepas	4.5

Great spot in Downtown Summerlin for a healthy meal. Vegetable cous cous was flavorful and well seasoned. Also had the steak bowl with feta salad great choice for $8. I will be back	4	Crazy Pita Rotisserie & Grill	4
Cant say much about this place. Tried twice and was no good. Went during breakfast and the food sucked went again with the wife during the later hours and the food was worse. Plus the place smells like an ash tray. No thank you.	1	Three Angry Wives	3
The service was not good. Place was empty and could not get a server to come out after I ordered my appetizer. The appetizer i ordered was the mussels and I give them a 1 out 5. Came in a sweet sauce and over cooked. Not my favorite. The manager did come out and talk with me. He offered me and my wife free dinner. I will not be going back.	2	Bonefish Grill	3.5

Poppa was our waiter, whom we always ask for. We come here 3-4 times a year from San Diego. This is old school Italian dining at its best. Chicken parm..spinach is awesome. We add garlic to ours...Yum. Make sure you ask for Poppa..Great guy!	5	Battista's Hole In the Wall	3.5
Such a bummer. Started out being a nice quaint dinner with a very good antipasto salad. Then came the stuffed artichoke that we tried to gag down. Then the entrees..wife and mother in law had the shrimp parmesiano that was horrific. Nothing parmesiano about it..was in some greasy oil concoction, ache returned to the kitchen. I had the shrimp Joe something that had the same sauce as the parmesiano. Blech to say the least. Will not be going back.	1	Chicago Joe's	4

Just left the outside bar after having a terrific time with Chris Evans the bartender. What a NICE guy. Told us about what to see on the strip and where to go. If someone needed something he immediately stopped chatting with us and took care of their needs. SIGN OF A GREAT BARTENDER!. Samantha made our guacamole..OMG! What a sweetie she was.

I would not recommend this restaurant. I spent 6 hours in the ER today due to horrid food poisoning from their shrimp and fish ceviche.  Definitely not cool when you're on a family vacation!	1	Border Grill	4
"Found Lago while looking for a nice dinner in Vegas...the style of the restaurant is Italian tapas, so 5-6 plates are recommended between 2. The restaurant isn't cheap, but their food is excellent!! Especially recommend the red wine risotto and the veal pasta! The only negative I could find for the food is probably just me...I felt the focaccia would have been better if there was salt on the focaccia before the ricotta & honey was added-it still tasted great though!

Request a table near the windows to have an incredible view of the bellagio fountains!"	5	Lago	4
We love coming to the west side location as the service is always exceptional! Today we brought some first timers and we decided to just sit in the bar area. Dolla Bill took good care of us and everyone enjoyed their food and had a great time-we will definitely be back!	5	Nacho Daddy	3.5
Really great sandwich spot, especially when your burned out on the same old places! Very friendly and fast service! Will definitely be back to keep trying new stuff on the menu.	5	The Sandwich Spot	4.5
Ate here for breakfast one morning during a conference at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Amazing food. Only had a chance to eat here once, but if I'm ever back there again I will definitely be going back for the short rib eggs benedict. Yum! The meat was so tender and the sauce was so delish...I wanted to scoop up every last drop. The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was great even inside a hotel next to a casino!! Pricey but worth it because the entire experience from food to service was superb!	4	The Henry	4
"Had to try this place because of the Triple D show...and of course, it was just as I had hoped. The burger was delish....I had the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. Yum! I took the Pork Belly Steamed Buns to go...amazing even as leftovers the food was good. I'm definitely going back and recommending it for others to try. 

I heard others have had to wait, but I went early for lunch and that was perfect because I walked right in and got a seat. The place did fill up by noon...so go for an early lunch or after the rush at noon. Service was great early on because I got my food quick and there was no wait for a table."	4	Bachi Burger	4
"Might be one of the best #foodielicious scallop dishes I have ever eaten in my lifetime. The scallops were cooked to perfection and served with vegetables that were co-stars in the show. I don't like peas, but the pea puree was incredible. I wanted to lick my plate! If you do anything or order anything...order and eat the caramelized sea scallops. If I was in Vegas right now I would go to dinner and eat the scallops.

What made the scallops even better...the service was impeccable and the view was 5 stars! Our server was Assaouir and she knows her stuff. I ordered the scallops and she new the perfect wine to pair with the dish. She was so friendly and had excellent knowledge of the food and wine. 

And if the food quality and service is not good enough for you...go for the view! We sat on the patio and had a view of the strip sitting underneath the Eiffel Tower and across the street from the Bellagio fountain show. Every 10-15 minutes a new song and fountain show was entertaining us. 

Oh, and not to be forgotten is the fresh french baguettes that are served with delish butter. We also ordered dessert...this menu is top notch! The service was on par and the view is world class and classic Vegas. But the sea scallops...they were the star of the show! Don't miss this place...it's worth every penny!"	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
Very bad experience, I ordered bubble milk tea which was $3.99 with ahhhhhhhhhh taste, but the final price was $5.6 with extra $1 for bubble, so tricky. The noodle was fxxx gross, never come back again.	1	Ru Yi Noodle House	2.5
Best nihari in town! Real authentic taste, reminded me of back home. Kadai chicken is also good with their naan. Friendly staff, definitely would recommend this place	5	Kabob N More	3.5
"On the recommendation from a fine dining and steak connoisseur(actually, a comedian's message board from the man himself, but the dude has exhibited good taste in the past...) I took my wife to N9NE at the tail end of May.

I was ill-prepared to be well-dressed as it was vacation, but not only did they seat us with courtesy but had no problems getting us in on last-minute reservations.  Stewart, our table assistant, was excellent in handling explanations and service for my wife and I.  

The food lived up to billing - from beginning to end, from salads to steaks to desserts.  The meat was prepared to spec, and required no additional seasoning or additives - nor was it over-prepared or over-salted.  

At the end of the night, the bill was more reasonable than I expected.  All staff was courteous and friendly from the time we entered the facility to our departure.  N9NE is on my planned stopping point in January when I go back for a conference.

And I'll ask for Stewart."	5	N9NE Steakhouse	4
Amazing place for food especially anything on the menu that has their very own house special, "bacon jam" on it.	5	Truffles N Bacon Cafe	4
Absolutely love this place. From the environment to the location. Food and the employees. It's always a great time here at Freddy's. Definitely a must place to eat at.	5	Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers	4
A very small place, only can fit about 16 people in their dinning room. Customer service isn't in their agenda. Had to wait about 15mins until someone eventually came up where I can get their attention to place an order BUT their food is amazing. Definitely made up for the lack of customer service.	4	Sammy's LA Pastrami & Burgers	3
Right when you open the door, you see a rustic yet modern look\/feel to this restaurant. It's a very inviting and comforting vibe. Great atmosphere and amazing food. I got a burger here and I can honestly say they were the first place where they cooked it exactly how I liked it. This place is phenomenal.	5	Honey Salt	4
Great place for food. A lot of different variety! Just lately for me it hasn't been the same as I keep on going there time after time. As if it's becoming an old thing for me.	3	SkinnyFATS	4.5
"Sushimon- I have such a love\/ hate feeling for you. It was a big step to go back after seeing a cockroach freely walking around your establishment. Which by the way, when we told the manager there was a roach, they quickly told us that it was a spider. Hmm. Roach.. Spider.. Roach? Two totally different things. But anyway, that's in the past. I have gone back a few times since then because the sushi is delicious. Many times I've gone while it was slow so the service was great. Oh but today, today someone had a case of the Mondays.

I was seated at the bar and at first, the service was great. The servers came by, checked on us, refilled drinks.. And of course the food was amazing. Then, came time for dessert. I tried flagging down any server passing by, one did look my way but kept walking. Okayyy.. I even went to the extreme of flailing my arms in the air and still, nothing. Finally, someone came over. I mentioned how we were forgotten and waiting for awhile. His response, ""so what can I get for you?"" Well. For damned sure you're going to get me my order cause I'm telling you to. But really? No acknowledgment of my comment, no apology, nothing. It's so sad because Sushimon's food is so good but their service leaves such a bad taste in your mouth."	3	Sushi Mon	4
Totally worth the wait. The longest I've waited was 2.5 hours. In the morning on a weekday, it's so slow.. You actually get to choose your seat. We always bring our visitors here and I always get the Combo Pan Roast. A ginormous spoon, a scoop of rice, and seafood swimming in creamy deliciousness. My choice of heat depends on the chef.. Bob does not mess around with the heat scale, if he's cooking, I go as low as a 5. If JJ is cooking, I'll go with a 7. Everything is made to order and the service is great. Those ladies really hold it down when it gets busy.	5	Oyster Bar	4.5
I went their for my husbands birthday the food was really good ... Omg the four cheese ravioli are the best if you're planning to go you have to try them :)	4	Maggiano's Little Italy	4
Steak was good but it's ridiculous that you can't get a refill on pop!  Our bill was over $400 for 4 of us and they want to charge us $4 for each pop, like $61\/steak wasn't enough!  Greed	2	StripSteak	4
"Hubby and I stumbled upon this little gem as we were leaving the Monte Carlo. We decided to stop in and grab some food before leaving to the airport to catch our flight. Being Asian, I just have to say, after a few days of eating fried, greasy food, it was nice to have a more cultured meal. 

Menu offered a good selection of dishes at an ""OK"" price (everything is pricey on the strip). Hubby and I ordered a few sushi rolls. I ordered the combo pho and he ordered the beef pho as our entree. 

Sushi was ok, rolls were a bit bigger than I would've wanted but the flavors were good. 

Pho was surprisingly great! I was definitely worried about flavor and portion and neither disappointed! The broth was flavored beautifully and the portions was all I wanted and more! 

Overall, great little place. I think we walked away spending $60 on all our food. I would definitely be back if I'm ever on the strip and is dying for pho!"	4	Dragon Noodle Co.	3
"Hands down one of the best dim sum places I've ever tried... and it's not even in my home town! Visited Vegas for independence weekend (2017) and after consuming buffets after buffets, the hubby and I wanted to venture outside of the strip. Found this little gem on yelp and decided to give it a try! We are avid dim sum eaters and seem to draw interest in trying a new place every time we travel outta town. 

From the exterior, this place is nothing special. Typical mom and pop restaurant that's stuck in ancient Asian decor. We were pleasantly surprised to see how busy it was and was seated right away. The manager (we think that's who it was) took our drink order and carts of food just started rolling our way. 

Let me tell you, everything was DELISH. We had 2 orders of shrimp\/crab fried balls, 1 order of shrimp hakkou(?), 1 order of chicken feet, 2 orders of rolled pan fried noodles, 1 order of Chinese broccoli, 1 order for pork bbq buns, 1 order of egg custard cupcakes, 1 order of steamed cream buns and 1 order shrimp rice noodles. Our tab was just under $60. Not bad as we walked away with our bellies full and a great experience. 

Customer service was indeed slow however, the manager lady who watched over our section was very attentive when called upon. 

Overall, if we are ever in Vegas again, we will definitely make this place a tradition to stop by!"	5	Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant	3.5
"When you're on the strip, everything is overpriced. Spent the morning at Ceasar's palace and stopped by Cafe Americano on the way out for some brunch. Ordered the American breakfast plate (I think that's what it was called), a mimosa and hubby ordered the huevos rancheros with a green smoothie. Overall, the food is really good. Fresh ingredients for sure. My hubby mentioned the huevos rancheros was one of the best he's ever had, so that definitely says something. My plate was traditional and boring, but it was also very good. 

Walked out spending $80. Expensive for sure. We realize that we could've just went back to our hotel and had the brunch\/breakfast buffet for $35. 

With everything else that the strip has to offer, I probably won't be back any time soon."	3	Cafe Americano	3.5
"Hubby and I visited Vegas during independence weekend (2017) and made plans to try bacchanal buffet. Prior to our trip, we researched all the different places we wanted to try during our trip and this place was at the VERY top of our list. 

Bacchanal buffet is located inside Caesar's palace and it is one of the most expensive buffets on the strip. Not to mention one of the most popular. If you don't get there early enough, you will wait over 200 minutes or pay an expensive fee to ""skip the line"".

We arrived at 4 for dinner. Dinner is served between 3-10 I believe and from what the cashier said, the busiest times were between 6-9. Boy was she wrong. Upon arriving, we checked into the kiosk to get a place in line and the kiosk gave us a return time of 219 minutes.. around 7:30. It also gave us the option to skip the line now for $35 per person. 

Because this was a new experience for us, we said eff-it, and paid the express fee. For my hubby and I, our total tab to enter was $227. $69 per person for dinner and $35 per person to skip the line. After paying, we were seated within 5-10 minutes. Not bad. Our hostess walked us to our table but unlike the other guests, she did not explain the different buffet sections. So, shame on her. 

Upon sitting down, we wait quite a while to get drinks ordered. We did not have a specific waiter assigned to us really. It was really chaotic and unorganized where we sat. We were seated in the Asian\/Italian section at the back of the restaurant which is a VERY good section to be in. The steamed crabs is in that section and if you've ever been to bacchanal, you'll know that the cold seafood section at the front of the restaurant is the most packed section. So having the steamed crabs by our table was great! No wait time. 

My favorites from this buffet would have to be:
-the steam crabs
-the Asian soup section 
-the roasted duck
-the roasted pork belly
-the desert and fruit section
-and somewhat the meat section (steaks & ribs)

Other than that, everything else is pretty mediocre. 
Do I think it's worth $227? For first time, sure. After this? Heck no. Will I be back? Maybe. For everything I enjoyed here, I could've easily gotten anywhere else on the strip. 

Really wanted to be amazed of this place, but in reality, it was a hyped up place for me and was nothing but hype."	2	Bacchanal Buffet	4
Probably the best pizza I had while visiting Vegas! Hubby and I stopped for a drink at the bar across from this place and grabbed a few slices from NYP. Pizza slices are big and we especially loved how there was an immediate crunch after your first bite! Some places make their crust a little too dough-y and I thought NYP perfected it according to my personal liking! Will definitely be back if I'm ever on the strip!	4	NYP- Pizzeria	3.5
It is a good place and it has very delicious food there！Bibimbap tastes really good，what I love most is the Beef and pork BBQ，the waiter and waitress are nice and cute	5	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5
Best authentic thai food in Vegas. Among our favorites: special hot and sour chicken soup with young tamarind leaves, eggplant basil, stir fry chinese broccoli, fresh po pia. Trust us, we are thai.	5	Thai Room	4
"Gordon Ramsay has 3 restaurants in Vegas and during my trip to Sin City, I was eager to try one of them. Definitely glad it was this one because GR sure knows what he's doing when it comes to burgers!!! 

My party of 5 came here on Friday for brunch. There wasn't a wait yet at 11AM but after we finished our meal, we saw a ~30-minute queue to be seated. While I'm glad I didn't have to wait in line...I wouldn't mind doing so for these bougie burgers. 

After browsing the menu, I settled on the Farm Burger w\/ duck breast bacon & a fried egg. It seemed to be a popular option and the waiter even confirmed that it was his personal favorite so I didn't have any ""buyer's remorse"" about my choice. 

The burger itself was very rich and juicy. The hero of the meal was the runny egg, which was a really nice touch. I enjoyed my burger...however, my bf's Hog Burger was a burger of impossibly EPIC proportions!!! After first bite, I was sold. It was flavorful, savory, had that magical X-factor, and I definitely see why it got a special spot on the menu apart from the other selections. If it sounds like I have the biggest school girl crush on it, it's because I do. 

Aside from our main course, we also ordered a portion of truffle fries to share. The fries were a hit! Our waiter suggested we order 2 for 5 people and when the fries came out in a cone, I questioned our decision of ordering just 1... The portion size looked dinky for $10. However, it ended up being just right because we were all full from our burgers. 

Service here was also spectacular, which was not surprising because GR is known for running a tight ship. Ambiance is also relaxed so you don't need to be dressed to the nines. 

Overall.... I had a GRand time GRubbing here. You might even say it was the best burGR I've ever had ;)."	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
Great consistent food. Each meal taste same as it did 10yrs ago. Same sized portions, same consistent service. Thumbs up! Thanks to the Xaypanya family!!	5	Ocha Thai Cuisine	4
"I don't often get to eat at fancier restaurants, so when I have the pleasure of eating at one I tend to hold them to higher standards. I live for good food, and when in Vegas I would expect nothing less. 
The waiter was extremely friendly when taking our order, and was attentive to us at just the right amount. The food arrived and before me was the most aesthetically pleasing arrangements of meats, noodles, and vegetables I have ever seen. The scent of broth, and something amazing punched me in the face, making me plunge deeper in awe. Not only was the food as beautiful as the Luxor itself, but it tasted amazing. The noodles and broth combined to create a warmth, and euphoric feeling equivalent to a rush of adrenaline. Although it was a little pricy in the upper teens, it was one-hundred and ten percent worth it, and I hope to enjoy it all over again someday."	5	Rice & Company	3
"It's a great restaurant. The food is fresh and prepared perfectly. We ordered shrimp, seafood and cactus tacos, all of them are excellent. 
The service is attentive too.  We will be back soon!"	5	El Dorado Cantina	4
"Some of, if not, THE best tacos I've had in Vegas since moving here in 2003. I live in Summerlin and have no problem driving to the other side of town to get my fix. 

The carne asada tacos are decent (as are the tripe and lengua tacos), but, the spicy pork adobada tacos are golden. At $2 each, they can't be beat. If you're planning on visiting, make sure to order at least one of the adobada tacos, you'll thank me later.

The service is extremely friendly as well.

Originally from San Francisco, I'm a seasoned vet when it comes to cheap, delicious, hole-in-the-wall taquerias. I almost don't want to admit it, but these tacos are better than any I can remember having in the Mission. 

I almost feel sorry for the taco shop across the way in the same strip mall, ""Los Tacos."" Almost. They're good, but overpriced. I believe Los Tacos originated in San Francisco, around 24th and Mission, and they're overpriced there as well. A single taco shouldn't cost $5+. 

Tacos El Gordo appears to have decimated the business at Los Tacos. It's funny driving between two competing taquerias where 90% of the cars are parked on one side of the lot. If they made burritos, I'd probably cry tears of joy."	5	Tacos El Gordo	4.5
"What stands out about this place is VIEWS!! VIEWS!! AND MORE VIEWS!!!  The food and service are definitely inferior.  My boyfriend and I went here for lunch.  We thought that we would splurge and enjoy a nice meal with a good view of the strip.  Upon sitting down I was stunned by the view, however, the tables were all too close and I was a little annoyed at having to hear the whole conversation of the people next to us.  The server was nice but honestly our service was very slow.  The food was delicious.  I ordered the ocean salad which was loaded with tastey things.  It had crab, lobster, prawns, artichokes, celery, avocado and best of all a delicious light vinaigrette dressing.  It was large sized which surprised me because most of the time at high end restaurants portions are tiny.  They really didn't skimp on anything.

My bf ordered a lamb hamburger that was delicious.  It was not overly gamey and it came with carmelized onions, peppers, chips, and a delectable sauce.  The bread was also really good.  It had anise seeds in it.  I have to say though I was a bit po'd when I got the bill and realized that my mediocre bloody mary cost $14!  I immediately wished that I had sent it back.  Oh well.  What can you do?  This is a great date place or reception restaurant.  I don't know how often I'd come  ($70 lunches aren't really my thing) but for a special occasion it is perfect!"	4	Eiffel Tower	4
Love this buffet! We always make a point of going here when in Vegas & it never disappoints! Seafood is fresh, delicious & the service excellent!	5	Village Seafood Buffet	3.5
Don't waste your money on the chicken marsala.....my steak knife even struggled to get through this tough piece if chicken!  What a waste if my hard earned money.  They have NO business charging that much for overcooked meat.......disgusting!	1	Rocco's	4

Unfortunately we haven't been able to get back recently but we have gone a few times since my original review. I've been meaning to update but keep forgetting. ....so here we go.....Sushi Koma is still our go to place. Every time we visit we walk out happy and our tummies are even happier!   The staff is just as friendly as can be. The food has never been a disappointment. We have recommended Sushi Koma to lots of people and always get good feed back. Keep doing what you're doing!  We look forward to our next visit.	4	Sushi Koma	4
We haven't been in a while. I had the fish and chips. Mostly for the fish and not the French fries. The fish was so crunchy and the tarter sauce has some spice to it now which is a yummy surprise. I would definitely recommend the fish for sure!	4	BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse	4
"Fun to go a few times a year with visiting friends and family.  I like the outdoor element -- get your exercise in whilst hunting for bargains!  I've found better deals in the non-outlet versions, but it doesn't hurt to look around.  The food court is rather lame for a 'premium' outlet mall; I mean, really, only a handful of offerings (Subway, a pizza place, a Japanese-style fast food outlet, etc.) facing a dining area that could use some redecorating.

Come here on weekdays, not weekends, if you don't want to run out of patience!"	3	Las Vegas North Premium Outlets	4
"I needed a quick dinner before a concert last night and really wanted salad.  I also wanted to stay close to UNLV, since that's where the concert was last night.  Ok, let's trek over to Chipotle's and reacquaint my mouth with their offerings.  Got a chicken salad sans rice but with guac and the hottest salsa and hey, it did the trick.  Service was fast and friendly -- there was hardly anyone in the joint last night at 6:30pm -- and yes, it may be a bit pricy but they claim to get their ingredients from legit places.  I'm down with that.

Tip: if you're craving a margarita, try one here.  It's pretty good and it works fast.  :)"	4	Chipotle Mexican Grill	3.5
Fresh, tasty carbs....not for the gluten-intolerant.  I stopped here for lunch halfway in my bike ride and chose the (huge) "kid-sized" ham and cheddar sandwich.  Yummy!  The bread was fresh, the ham was slightly sweet, and the cheddar was savoury enough to balance the ham.  Great Harvest also doles out very generous samples of their baked goods and I got a piece of white chocolate-raspberry bread (more like cake, really) that was as big as my hand.  (It was really delicious too!)  The clerk who took my order was super nice and the place was clean and inviting.  Come visit and take home some bread or baked goodies!  Don't forget your sample.  :)	4	Great Harvest Bread Company	4
"Not impressed.  My out-of-town friend and I were strolling in the Paris hotel when we got an urge for crêpes....saw La Creperie and decided to check it out.  First, we were the only ones ordering crêpes.  No excuses for poor or slow service, right?  Second, le monsieur at the window must have been having an off day because he didn't smile at all.  I have heard from reputable sources that French ppl are not the most gregarious of folk, but sheesh.  Would it kill ya to smile?  Third, our Napolean (lemon curd\/berry) crêpes needed more curd.  There was only a teaspoon or so of the curd which translates to too many naked, dry crépe bites.  Perhaps I should try the savoury crêpes to compare? 

Our crêpes took longer than I thought to make, given the fact that there was no one else ordering anything.  Will I return?  Probably not.  Hélas.  Le sigh."	2	La Creperie	3.5
Was craving a burger after hiking Charleston (and having a fellow hiker inadvertently drop a rock on my finger - OW!).  Smashburger was reasonably close and did the job.  It's not supposed to be like In-n-out, with the extreme cheap-valueness.  S-burger offers a wider menu and pricier ingredients, which may account for the slightly higher, but still relatively inexpensive prices (sweet potato fries! salads! nutter butter shakes!)  My classic burger was juicy and the ingredients fresh.  It was served with a smile and received with a bigger one.  Try it, you'll like it!	4	Smashburger	3.5
This Panera just opened and is in a prime location in Boca Park.  I'm no stranger to Panera, having made many visits during my time as a grad student back east.  The "you pick 2" deal is always satisfying (pick any combo of a half sandwich, soup, or salad) and for an extra $0.99, you can add on a cookie.  The baked goods are on the dry side, which is a little disappointing, and the tea selection can use a few more herbal options.  Service was friendly, if a bit slow (staff was mainly comprised of what looked like high school students??), but overall, Panera is a cheaper -- and slightly more nutritious -- alternative to Cheesecake Factory, Gordon Biersch, Kona, etc.	3	Panera Bread	3
"A wonderful addition to the Summerlin area and a great place to enjoy some trendy ambience in Boca Park.  My party enjoyed our evening from the moment we stepped in: the restaurant features an open-concept floor plan, allowing one to see and be seen, with plenty of dark wood and chic light fixtures that add contemporary decorative flair.  Our server was very friendly and obviously wanted us all to have a positive experience, stopping by several times to refill water glasses and to check that everything was to our liking.

Honey Salt states that they are ""committed to providing fresh and innovative food"" (website) and they do indeed follow through.  Our collective entrées included the Scottish salmon (served on a bed of quinoa pilaf, braised fennel, house-made peppadew chimichurri sauce; $25), the free range brick oven chicken (served with kale and anaheim pepper mac n' cheese; $22), and the caramelized sea scallops (served with charred cauliflower and vanilla bean cauliflower puree; $28).  All were delightful, fresh, and delicious.  I especially enjoyed my chimichurri sauce with my salmon, as the bright flavours complemented the delicacy of the fish.  My hubby's scallops were fantastic!  The chicken was not overcooked at all (whew!) and the mac 'n cheese was so yummy.  For dessert, we shared a warm bread pudding (with the most lovely bourbon toffee sauce) and a (huge) slice of the triple layer cake (2 layers of chocolate fudge cake, 1 layer of roasted banana cake all iced with brown sugar buttercream).  Good thing we shared....sort of.  So good!  

I don't have any complaints about the food as everything was excellent.  The ambience is trendy and slightly slanted towards youth, but anyone can come here and enjoy a terrific meal.  My only critique about the actual space is that it would have been nice to have a bit more, er, space between tables.  Because of this, at times I felt like I was in a cafeteria.  A very chic, expensive cafeteria, but still...!  Honey Salt is not an inexpensive place, but then again, you get what you pay for....and you get quality here.  

I am DEFINITELY coming back to check out the lunch menu....and to snag another piece of that triple layer cake!  Make sure to take a look at the salt and pepper shakers display at the front of the restaurant -- so cute!"	4	Honey Salt	4
Solid place for comfort food!  As the name says, RR serves burgers and fries and drinks.  I was extra hungry and craving something warm and tasty and easy, so RR fit the bill.  My Whiskey Jack BBQ chicken burger was yummy and gone within minutes and my steak fries were satisfyingly thick and salty and starchy.  (Bottomless fries!!)  We also got the red velvet cake which wasn't too bad for something taken out of the freezer.  While RR would not be my usual choice for dinner fare, it was fun and close by and convenient.  If you have picky friends, this place would be appealing and "safe.	3	Red Robin Gourmet Burgers	3.5
"Like many others have said, Container Park is a new retail complex in Downtown Las Vegas comprised of shipping containers.  It's trendy and eclectic and offers a safe, clean place for families to hang out during the day and a ""contained"" place for the 21+ crowd to socialize at night.  There is adequate, if not ample, street parking around Container Park and rates are $1\/hour (maximum 2 hours).  I believe parking is free after 6pm -- anyone know for sure?  

We went in the afternoon during a weekday and found the place very quiet (not a surprise).  Cool things: praying mantis sculpture at entrance, treehouse and slide in the center of the park, super yummy smells emanating from the various restaurants.  Not so cool: how excited will people be to visit Container Park in the summer during the day?  This park is obviously meant to be enjoyed whilst wandering around outside.  Will there be misters come summer to rehydrate the bodies of the dehydrated visitors staggering around for relief from the desert sun?  

I would have liked more variety in the existing shops.  They range from recycled jewellery\/housewares, ""artsy"" women's apparel, goodies (frozen desserts, cupcakes), and art galleries.  Fun to browse, but not enough interest to keep my attention for very long.  Then again, perhaps I have a shorter attention span than most other people....?

We ended our visit to Container Park by chilling at The Beat Coffeehouse (just a short walk away).  Great way to conclude the afternoon and another plus in favour of Container Park!"	4	Downtown Container Park	4
"I've been to this ST a few times and have always experienced friendly staff and fresh food.  I've noticed that the salad bar turnover is high, which explains the high quality of vegetables.  The soup station features 5-6 different soups, all made on-site and all tasty.  Baked offerings include several different types of bread (foccacia w and w\/o cheese, cornbread, muffins) and dessert (crisps, cobblers, molten cake).  Frozen yogurt and fruit station seem popular, but can't tell you what they're like as I've never had any of it!  ST is great for vegetarians and for those wanting a lighter meal (as long as the desserts and cheesy items are consumed in moderation).  Cheap buffet + cafeteria style ambience = casual meal out.  

Hey, no tip necessary!  :)"	4	Sweet Tomatoes	3.5
"Hubby took me here for a quick birthday surprise dinner tonight.  He told me he wanted to find a non AYCE sushi place and decided to yelp for such places....great find and thanks, yelpers!  We shared the jalapeno pepper tempura, toro sashimi, TNT roll (spicy salmon and tuna), and Hawaiian roll (tuna).  All were fresh and flavourful.  Our server was delightful and chatty and we were very pleased with the quality of the food and the ""comfy-ness"" of the interior.  The restaurant is small and consists of a little bar area in the front and a dozen (?) or so small square tables in a row extending away from the bar.

Presentation of the sushi is very pretty (see photos) and reflects the care the chef takes with his craft.  When can I go again?  :)"	5	Yummy Grill & Sushi	4.5
Reliable place for good eats.  I had the chicken salad sandwich which was nice and flavourful.  Service was kind of apathetic, which disappointed me a tad, especially since the place wasn't that busy.  However, it's nice to have a dependable option for food on the Strip when your party can't come to a decision within a reasonable time frame!	3	Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill Las Vegas	4
We stopped in to have a look-see after a very tasty dinner at Mashisoyo.  I have a very difficult time turning away from bakeries and the cute little teddy bear on the bakery's exterior sign was calling me.....the place was empty, unsurprisingly, as it was around 7:30pm, quite late for a bakery.  Teddy's is advertised as a "European" bakery; some of the yelp folks say it's Bavarian or Eastern European of some sort.  The displayed cakes and cookies in the glass cases looked good and honestly, I was thinking that they probably looked better than they tasted.  Since we were still stuffed from dinner, we decided to get a pound's worth of assorted cookies to go.  (One pound of cookies is almost $12\/pound!  Kind of steep if you ask me.)  At home, we sampled one each and to our jaded surprise, enjoyed the buttery-ness and not-too-sugary-ness of our treats.  They tasted (almost) fresh.  Good enough for 3*!  Next time I visit Mashisoyo, I'll try a slice of cake and update this review.	3	Teddy's Bakery	2.5
I've been here lots of times after hiking Charleston and its surrounding peaks.  Great place to enjoy a bite and to gaze at the beautiful scenery.  On my most recent visit, the reason for my presence was to celebrate a wedding.  It was a lovely day and the Lodge staff gave us a lot of behind-the-scenes assistance to get everything ready on time.  I was the cake baker\/slicer\/server and had to call upon the Lodge staff for various items in order to do my job!  All the guests consumed their meals with gusto and we all delighted in the Lodge's rustic charm and intimacy as we witnessed our friends tie the knot.  :)	4	Mt Charleston Lodge Restaurant	3.5
"Beautiful interior, attentive waitstaff, and oodles of well-kept, well-stocked food stations.  I wasn't prepared to be as impressed as I was, but the pretty food -- yes, pretty! -- kept on calling my name and encouraging me to have *just* a little more.  I enjoyed everything I sampled: prime rib, kalbi, sushi, veggies, pasta....I didn't find anything overcooked or undercooked.  The desserts were also good, which was actually a relief.  Too often, I find that desserts at a buffet LOOK amazing, but fall short on taste.  Not here, at least to my tastebuds.  

Weekday lunch to dinner turnover starts at 2pm, so don't expect more food to be brought out to the stations after 2pm (for lunch, that is)."	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
This is definitely a hole-in-the-wall.  A friend of mine suggested this place, recommended to her by a different friend (the recommender lives in Los Angeles!).  When hubby and I arrived, we were rather dismayed to find ourselves standing outside the rather shabby exterior, flanked by questionable businesses in a sketchy strip mall.  However, all reservations dissipated when spotting the many photos of celebs on the walls and smelling the yummy smells within.  The four of us chose the pad Thai (with chicken), snapper, drunken noodles with tofu, and the northern style sausage.  All were excellent: not drowning in sauce, no bad aftertaste, just flavourful food that made us overeat.  :)  Service was especially good: attentive, patient, yet unobtrusive.  Prices are mid-level (around $12-15\/entree) and portions were generous, not ridiculously so.  We will definitely come again.	5	Lotus of Siam	4
"Since I'm not a frequenter of buffets, I was rather curious about the hoopla surrounding them.  When our Canuck pals came into town for a quick visit, they suggested we check out Bellagio's buffet, since they wanted to try it.  I was more impressed than I thought!  The variety of food and the quality of the food was great (I really enjoyed the protein offerings).  You will find prime rib and seafood and Mexican entrees and sushi....whatever you could possibly want.  Everything I had, from the meat to the veggies, tasted fresh.  And dessert!  Lots of them and happily, everything wasn't too large.....which meant lots of sampling.  My favourites included the little lemon tarts and the chocolate mousse.

Service was good and the seating area didn't feel like I was in a buffet.  Our server was very patient with us, especially when my friend's kid spilled Coke everywhere.  ;P"	4	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
"Hubby surprised me by taking me here for my birthday last week.  He had very specific parameters within which to work: 1) the restaurant had to be close to UNLV because I had to get back that night for a rehearsal, 2) the restaurant had to have good yelp reviews!, and 3) the restaurant HAD to have chocolate cake on the dessert menu (because I like cake and because it's my birthday!).  He found Tommy Bahama's, made a reservation just in case, and picked me up at the uni.  

What a lovely dinner!  The food was FANTASTIC.  Service was almost flawless; waitstaff forgot to bring our grilled artichoke appetizer before our main dishes.....BUT they comped the appetizer to make up for that oversight and gave me 3 free desserts because it was my birthday!  

Our dinner began with the bread basket and honey\/cinnamon\/garlic butter.  Warm, soft, crusty bread with sweet butter.  What's not to like?  The grilled artichoke was decadent and delicious.  For our mains, we both ordered fish: I had the the seared ahi tuna (YUM) and hubby had the black cod (again, YUM).  Portions were not huge; rather, they were ""normal"" sized and allowed us the stomach space to have a multi-course meal.  Desserts were perfect.  The chocolate cake was rich and velvety and indulgent, the key lime pie featured fabulous bright flavours that contrasted with the graham crust, and the pina colada cake was just plain good.  The waitstaff even sang ""Happy Birthday"" to me whilst bringing out my desserts.  How cute!

All in all, I never would have thought that a retail clothing store would house a hidden dining gem.  Would I come again?  Most definitely.  Thanks for a GREAT birthday meal, Tommy!  :)"	5	Tommy Bahama Restaurant | Bar | Store - Las Vegas	4
Came here after a long hike to refuel and left very full!  Leticia's is a solid Mexican place to stuff yourself silly.  I'm not a Mexican food expert, but everything I had was yummy.  Some may quibble at the lack of authenticity or "overpackaging" (regarding presentation and decor), but the atmosphere is fun and the food is good.  On my visit a couple of days ago, service was a little bit slow, but waitstaff were still nice and fairly accommodating.  Portions are large, prices are mid-range (i.e., not cheap but not wallet-breaking), and the free salsa and chips are really quite good!  Try the meatball soup for something warm and differently delicious.	4	Leticia's Mexican Cocina	4
"My first visit here was not a disappointment.  Hubby and I were warmly greeted by David and were immediately charmed by his friendliness and good humour.  We chose the roti for an appy and the crispy duck (today's special, $19.95, probably one of the priciest items on the menu).  The roti came with a lovely curry sauce, more sweet than spicy.  Our duck was lovely, crispy, and meaty.  Accompanying the duck were three sauces: curry, hoisin, and mango (my fave), along with stir-fried bok choy, steamed rice, and tortilla wraps.  I'm so glad I shared the duck, as portions were generous.  

David came by several times to refill our water glasses and to admonish us to ""share our food.""  He also looked at my husband valiantly nabbing julienned slices of carrot and told him: ""don't waste the food.""  :)

The restroom was spotless, definitely a great sign for a restaurant.

We will most definitely come again!"	5	Pan Asian	4.5
Panera has been a favourite of mine since grad school days back east.  The menu is simple: soups, salads, sandwiches and baked goods.  You can get the "you pick 2" special, which nabs you a half sandwich and soup, a soup and salad, or a half sandwich and salad.  Calorie listings are posted next to the item on the overhead menu, either guilting you or tempting you in your food choices.  I came here with my parents, both of whom are very VERY picky eaters and not shy about asking lots of questions.  Thank you to the very nice and patient staff for not rolling their eyes!  :)  I've never had a problem with food or service in all the times I've visited a Panera location.  Free wifi only makes a visit more pleasant!	4	Panera Bread	3.5
Most people have heard of Smashburger, so this review will be short and sweet.  Every time I've visited a Smashburger location, my burger has been tasty, hot, and smashed thin, per the name.  I always get a yelp check-in discount, which is a perk, and service is usually good.  Smashburger is a little higher-end than most fast-food chains, as the ingredients used are a bit nicer and the quality of the burgers higher.  This place is good for a cheap burger fix that won't make you feel too guilty about indulging.	4	Smashburger	3.5
"Friend and I stopped here for lunch at the Fashion Show and were pleasantly surprised by the vegan and vegetarian options.  She ordered the chicken provolone sandwich (vegan style) and I chose the chicken spinach wrap (regular, no changes).  I was a little disappointed with my wrap, as it was on the bland side....I hoped for a bit more flavour, especially since it came with a pesto mayo, but nope.  However, the amount of spinach that came with the wrap (and in the actual tortilla) should do me for the next year or so!  We were too full to try a cookie or cake, but will shoot for that next time.  Service was very friendly.

I liked the location of this Red Velvet as it was tucked under the elevator.    Kind of made it seem like it was in a different world than the rest of the bustling mall.  :)"	3	Red Velvet Café	3.5
"Strangely enough, last night's visit to Orchids was only my second time ever having dim sum.  I am a bad Asian.  A friend invited several of us to celebrate her successful completion of her doctoral degree and to enjoy some dishes.  We chose a variety of dishes, including the chicken feet, the Chinese broccoli, the pork dumplings, turnip cakes, and Peking duck. 

Pros: plenty of parking, clean and updated bathroom (the sinks were those fancy glass basins that sit on top of the counter), and clean floor (yes, worth mentioning IMO!).  Service was pretty good, perhaps due to my friend being Taiwanese and speaking Cantonese!  The cart ladies came around often and prices seem reasonable, but I wouldn't know for certain because my friend treated us to dinner.  (Nice or what?)  

Cons: personally, I liked the broccoli, pork dumplings, and turnip cakes the best.  I found the chicken feet greasy and lacking in texture; the skin tasted cold and sort of like congealed fat.  Same with the duck; while I enjoyed the flavor of the actual duck meat with the accompanying sauce, I thought the skin was more limp than crisp, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.

Nothing was horrible, but nothing stood out as stellar.  It was a fun evening with some friends and I'm glad to have sampled some dim sum again, but I think I'll check out another Asian eatery next time."	3	Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant	3.5
"This place is the rice equivalent of Subway: choose your rice (white or brown), meat, and 3 veggies and the cook will fry it all up for you.  I elected to have brown fried rice with grilled chicken and veggies (red and yellow peppers and carrots).  Decent portion size and tasty.  Instead of being fried with the rice and veggies, the chicken comes on a skewer and is accompanied by your choice of dipping sauce (I chose Korean sauce).  Hubby got the garlic bento box (assortment of meats and rice) and actually finished the lot (pig!).  Impressive, considering the amount of food!

The joint is small and nondescript, situated in a little strip mall on Jones.  While the food was very good, the floors and tables were a bit sticky, which distracted me a bit from the yummy food.  

I may not choose to eat in next time, but would definitely consider takeaway, next time I want fried rice."	4	Rice Trax Teriyaki Grill	4.5
Finally FINALLY had a chance to sample shave ice, the oh-so-elusive icy treat...at least in my eyes.  Shave ice, not shaveD ice, is the connoisseur's Slurpee....powdery ice that is the receptacle for all kinds of lovely flavoured syrups....melts in your mouth and sometimes all over your hands!  Portions are generous: kiddie size for $3, small for $4, large for $5, and a bowl for $6.  One can choose 3 flavoured syrups from a list of 30+ and top one's ice with free toppings.  I had a simple and elegant :) cherry and grape small shave ice and my husband had the "spicy mamacita," an adventurous blend of mango, tamarind, sour spray, and chile con limon (pepper flakes).  Aloha FLAVOUR.  I loved how each mouthful was flavoured ice and not ice that tried to have flavour (a la snow cones with their huge -- by comparison -- chunks of ice).  A perfect way to cool off in the Vegas heat.	5	Snow Ono Shave Ice	5
Very happy to find a good pizza place close to home.  I got the deluxe pizza and garlic knots for takeaway and was hard-pressed not to sample anything on the short drive home.  The knots were buttery, garlicky, soft, and warm -- diet food it ain't!  The pizza was really good.  I really liked the tomato sauce (tangy, flavourful, NOT bland at all) and the crust (thin crust with a great thickness at the edge, perfect for gripping and for chewing).  The only thing that could have been improved is more topping.  I didn't feel that there was quite enough veg or meat on the pizza.  However, I'm willing to try another pizza soon.  :)	4	Upper Crust Pizza	4
A solid place to grab a quick lunch located in a convenient shopping plaza close to Red Rock Canyon.  I was on a (yet another) training bike ride and was coming back from Blue Diamond when the stomach started telling me to get food quickly.  I spotted the Subway, thought it would be a short stop, and walked in.  There were only a few customers ahead of me, but despite that, it took well over 15 minutes to place my order, then another 5-10 minutes to receive order and pay for it.  None of the orders before me were large or labour intensive, so I was wondering why it took so long to get my "fast" food sandwich.  Perhaps I was bordering on being "hangry?"  Oh well.  The cookies made up for my wait.	3	Subway	4
Yay for comfort food closer to home!  On my first visit, I was impressed with the host's poise under pressure, since this particular Red Robin had just opened a few days prior.  Customers were pouring in and despite the cramped quarters in the waiting area, host and servers were doing their utmost to remain positive and professional.  Our food was served hot, the bottomless steak fries were yummy as always (crisp on outside, steaming on inside, not greasy at all), and my husband's beer was gone too quickly.  Congratulations on the new location and we'll see you again soon, RR!	4	Red Robin Gourmet Burgers	2.5
I was pleasantly surprised!  Honestly wasn't expecting much, but my chicken tortilla soup was really good.  Very flavourful and featuring a lovely broth.  My server, Victor, was delightfully snarky whilst demonstrating waiterly competence.  My lunch companions were equally happy with their meals and we all wished we could stay longer to enjoy the island ambience.	4	Bahama Breeze	4
"Hubby and I successfully climbed a mountain today and, as usual after a successful ascent, I was hungry.  Tummy was rumbling and grumbling like a disgruntled bear.  I've been wanting to try Slidin' Thru NW for a while and today was it.  Nothing like a good long hike to give one an excuse to eat really bad food.....

....and the food was bad in that great wonderful junk food way, except the quality of the ingredients was very high!  I ordered one Plain Jane sans cheese (regular angus beef slider) and one Porky (bbq pulled pork) and hubby ordered one Pep Pep (BLT + cheese) and one Caprese (as in the salad).  We shared an order of the sweet potato fries.

Great flavour and food quality.  The Porky bbq sauce is SO GOOD.  What do they put in it??  Hubby's Caprese slider was delish as well, featuring a nice blend of the balsamic vinegar with the mozza.  Some may feel the prices to be on the high side for baby burgers, but I'm ok with paying a bit more for quality.  (And, the sliders aren't baby sized.  Two plus a side of fries is a decent meal.)  Prices range from $2.50-$3.50 for sliders and $2 for regular fries to $3 for the sweet potato fries.

NB: The sweet potato fries are sweet!  Instead of salt, the folks at Slidin' Thru sprinkle a cinnamon-sugar-y mix over the fries.  I prefer my fries salty, so will not order the sweet potato fries again; that said, the fries were crispy and hot!

NB#2: Is there a way to avoid the use of styrofoam?  I know that the sliders can get messy and hot sliders are the goal, especially for the drive thru customers, but styrofoam?  Really?

The place was super clean when we went earlier today and the staff very enthusiastic about our first-time visit.  :)"	4	Slidin Thru	4
"Hubby and I went last night on a recommendation from a friend.  It was pretty quiet when we got there - only 3 tables of 3-4 people.  The decor is a surprisingly pleasant mélange of Tuscan\/Southwest\/Indian, with gold, crimson, and sage being the main colours.

Server was friendly and attentive.  We ordered a chickpea marsala and a lamb tikka; both featured tasty, spicy sauces.  The naan was fresh from the oven and was lovely with the entrée sauces.  Everything seemed really fresh and nothing left a bad aftertaste!  Portion sizes are deceptively large.  The prices are a little higher than I expected, but I suppose one could split an entrée or two to try to save some $.

I would come here again!"	4	Saffron Flavors of India	4
"It's been a long while since I've visited the Chang.  Went here a few days ago with work colleagues for lunch and ordered the beef and broccoli lunch bowl.  This entree comes with either a hot and sour soup (my choice) or egg drop soup.  I found the soup to be 'meh' -- not great but not bad.  The beef was very salty and I found myself drinking a lot more water the rest of the day to combat the thirsty feeling I had all afternoon.  This place is exactly how I remembered it: a decent choice for a meal that is in the mid-price range.  You won't get standout food, but you probably won't die of any diseases either!  Our server was friendly and came around often to refill glasses\/drinks.  

None of my colleagues were 'wowed' by their lunches either, but most of the food was consumed, so I'm guessing no one was super picky either."	3	P.F. Chang's	3.5
"A hidden gem of a steakhouse in one of the least impressive casino hotels on the Strip.  The Steakhouse oozes old school charm: red leather booths, dark wood paneling, and dim lighting.  Upon entering, we noted the dry age room with all sorts of cuts of beef.  We then saw the open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant -- a good sign.  This place doesn't have anything to hide!  

The meal: we started with the complimentary bread basket.  All were fresh and warm.  I particularly liked the raisin bread.  Hubby chose the caesar salad and I elected to opt out of choosing a salad.  :)  (N.B. This place is not à la carte!  Sides are included.)  My salmon filet was perfectly cooked and my accompanying mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery.  Hubby's porterhouse was tender and VERY GOOD.  I almost wished I ordered that myself.  The only less-than-stellar component of our dinners was the veg (that night, carrots).  No flavour.  Dessert was the chocolate mousse cake.  It's the only dessert not housemade, but it was still decadent and delicious.  Coffee was meh, happy hour wine was yay.

Good value for a steakhouse on the Strip, as you're paying for the meat\/seafood AND sides.  Great place for a cozy dinner, romantic date, or splurge.  Service was very good."	4	THE Steak House	4
Over the past few months, my consumption of McDonald's food has markedly increased, thanks to an increase in my cycling mileage.  I mean, really, when else is it acceptable, nay, even expected, to replenish lost salts and calories via Mickey D's?  Thus, my feelings towards McD's may be skewed to be more positive than most yelpers.  When I dropped into this McDonald's for a quick lunch break during a bike ride, I was famished and heartily devoured a hot cheeseburger and fresh fries in approximately 2 seconds.  After inhaling my lunch, I noticed that the place was clean and, after a quick visit to the loo, the restroom was clean as well.  Staff seemed pleasant enough and got both my husband's order and mine correct (although that should really be a given).  McD's is what it is and I'm always glad to see the golden arches when I'm riding my bicycle!	3	McDonald's	2.5
Friendly service, yummy thin-crust pizza, nice tangy sauce....what's not to like?  Ambience is casual and prices are inexpensive.  We shared a large deluxe pizza and basically inhaled it as fast as we could since we were rather empty in the abdominal area!  I'd much rather go here than Grimaldi's, which is in the same ginormous Boca Park complex around the bend, as ESP seemed to know what I want before I wanted it.  Grimaldi's seemed a bit on the tame, boring side with disappointing sauce.  I suppose this pizza joint's initials says it all.  :)	4	East Side Pizza	3
"I really wanted to give Fleming's 5 stars!  I had heard a lot about it and had my hopes set high.  We went here about a week ago to celebrate hubby's birthday and were excited to ingest red meat....happens once or twice a year at best.

The interior is lovely and dark, as befits a steakhouse.  We thought the tables were closer to each other than necessary; the overall effect was less intimate and more crowded.  Hmm.

Hostess was pleasant and perky as she guided us to a booth (yay!).  Our actual server was a little on the reserved side and could not be blamed for being overly solicitous at all.  (Someone else came to inquire how we liked our food.)

Yes, the food.  We each got a salad (Fleming's Salad and the Wedge Salad), and enjoyed them both very much.  I ordered the BBQ Scottish Salmon Fillet -- yeah, I know I said I was excited to eat a steak, but I also really really like salmon! -- and hubby got the NY Strip steak with a side of asparagus.  Both entrées were very good and proved that the kitchen knows what they're doing.  Sadly, we were both too stuffed for dessert.

My criticisms: the service.  I'm sure that many folks who have visited Fleming's have received excellent service and that's fantastic.  I'm just a little disappointed that our server was basically just doing her job: serving the food.  We mentioned right away that it was our first visit -- a tip for introducing house specials or suggesting wine pairings or just chatting about how awesome the food is -- but nada.  She seemed most animated when she brought us our bill.  (The gent who cleared our dishes after each course was smiley and happy, though!)

So, the thing I most remember about my first visit to Fleming's is the food, which is probably a good thing.  However, I had expected more skill and enthusiasm from our server, especially when I was paying a pretty penny for dinner."	4	Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar	4
Still has the best AYCE sushi in the area in my opinion. Staff is friendly, food is proportioned generously, good prices on drinks and they have never dissapointed!	5	Sasa Sushi	4
"I have been to the Golden Steer now 3 times and I would return.  The service is impecable but a little slow, but I don't mind that when i am spending a decent amount for dinner.   The last time I went was with a girlfriend, who loves to flirt and we got free bananas foster!  

The food is some of the best food that I have had in Vegas.  I have had the escargot here and it is pretty tasty.  We always order the table side caesar and it is fantastic because the dressing is made from scratch right in front of you.  I don't usually order caesar salad because more times than not it is from a bottle and tastes terrible.  The steaks are very tender and flavorful and the sides are big enough to share.  The bananas foster is excellent and is also served tableside.  They add a little orange zest to the sauce, which I have never seen before, but it adds a nice little zing to the dish.  

We love taking out of towners here for dinner mainly because it is fun to reserve the rat pack booths, but next time I will request Elvis's booth (just found out that he used to eat there).  Love the old timey vegas ambiance!"	5	Golden Steer Steakhouse	4
"We got the restaurant at a little after 5 and they were still not open, even though they were supposed to open at 5.  We had 5:30 reservations, but got there early.  When they finally opened the doors, they were still turning on lights and lighting table candles.  The waiter also commented to us that he wasn't expecting us that early.  This really didn't bother us becasue the service turned out to be excellent.  We loved the ambiance of this place.  There were quite a few cubby holes for a romantic dinner for 2.  

Now, for the food and the reason for the 3 stars.  The food was ok, no better than anything that I could have cooked at home.  We did like the crudite basket that comes with every meal, it was a nice departure from your typical salad.  The veggies were nice and fresh and crispy.  We started with the seafood over puffed pastry in a lobster sauce.  It was good, but a little salty.  I had the duck breast and confit with a berry sauce.  It was good, but I have had better confit at other establishments in vegas.  I also ordered a side of french green beans and they were very fresh and tasty.  My husband had the Wild Boar special with a cognac cream sauce and said it was really good.  When he ordered, however, he asked if it came with anything such as potatoes.  He was told no, so he ordered a side of Pommes Frites.  Well, as it turned out there was asparagus and a tomato provencal on the plate.  It is too bad we didn't know this in advance becasue we wouldn't have wasted $5 on ""Pommes Frites"".  We are pretty sure that they went down the street to the local McDonald's to get our fries.  Come on now, if you are going to run a french restaurant, the least you can do is hand cut your Pommes Frites!  I would give this place 3.5 stars, but since I can't it got 3. 

 I probably wouldn't go back because there are so many other great places in Vegas to eat.  We did use a Groupon, which made the bill pretty inexpensive."	3	Pamplemousse Le Restaurant	4
We ate here during restsurant week and had the four course meal for $50.11.  A portion of the procedes went to Three Square a vegas food bank.   This was the only saving grace, knowing we were doing some good.  The meal started with seafood soup, which was nothing special.  Next was cantonese style roast duck.  Not sure what cut of the bird this was, but it was mostly bone with a little meat.  It was served with cold marinated bamboo shoots.  These were interesting because i have never had them before, but again, nothing special.  The main course was scallops and asparagus.  I think the sauce was just oyster sauce, very salty and a little greasy, but the scallops were nicely cooked.  For dessert i had mango and pumalo in a mango custard.  This was pretty good.  Overall, the whole meal was just ok.  I have had way better meals for this price during restaurant week in the past.  Not sure how a mediocre chinese restaurant can stay in buisness in a city like Vegas with all the exceptional restaurant options.  Would not recomend.  Oh yeah, i should mention that i didn't choose the restaurant, we were with a group.  I wouldn't have chosen to come here in the first place, because why eat chinese food when you could have thai!?	2	Beijing Noodle No. 9	2.5
"We went to the Flame Steakhouse before a show at the Smith Center and the service was great and prompt.  I did order a glass of wine and it was bad.  It was a Sangiovese, which I can't imagine gets ordered too frequently so I wasn't totally surprised.  Our server promptly replaced it with a Pinot Noir.  The ambiance was nothing special and the tvs were a strange addition to the dining room.  

The food was very good.  I had the beef tournedos which had the fois gras on top.  The steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful and I could cut it with my butter knife.  Next time though I would just order the regular filet because the fois gras didn't add anything to the dish, especially because it was a tiny slice on each tournedos.  

My husband had the prime rib and he said that it was good as well but nothing special as far as p rib goes.  I had the ""garbage"" salad and that was decent.  DH had the caesar and said that it was just okay.  We shared an order of grilled asparagus with hollandaise sauce and the sauce appeared to be made from scratch.  That is always a plus.  Overall, not a bad place for the price, but if you are looking for old time Vegas and don't mind spending a little more, the Golden Steer is the place to go!"	4	The Flame Steakhouse	3.5
We went here for the first time on a groupon and will definitly be going back!  The topping selection is very diverse and everything was fresh.  I like that you can choose from white, whole wheat, or gluten free crust.  What I don't like is that the Whole Wheat costs a dollar extra.  You can't tell me that it costs that much more to make a ww crust!  Also, why is it always extra for the "healthier" option.  I liked that they had a pesto option for the sauce, and my husband liked that they had a spicy red sauce.  I have to agree with another reviewer when she said that the crust isn't that good.  I liked how crispy it got, but it is lacking in flavor.  I think they need to add more salt to the dough, it was just a little bland.  They also have a salad pizza option, which I may try the next time.  Over all we enjoyed it.  Oh, BTW you could totally share a pizza and a salad if you didn't want a huge meal.  We each got our own (because we can't agree on toppings) and both took half home.	4	Custom Built Pizza	4.5
That place is so shady! We ended up there because we were looking for a Latin night. The music was ok but it just felt weird being there.	2	La Rumba Night Club	2
Came here because we wanted ice cream in the area and everything was closed. We shared some and had to ask for plates. When we got them one had mystery condiment streaked on it and the other had thick dried water on it. It was hard to eat off it. I did it and can say I am okay today. As for the ice cream, not that great, I should have just gone to the market and made my own.	1	Chili's	3
"Downtown, inside the Golden Gate which is under renovation. Don't come on a Saturday morning unless you can handle all that comes with an overloaded restaurant. There's no line to be seated, just go to the front. The line is for paying.  Food is good, but not intimidating for those too scared to eat anything ""weird.""

The pancakes are everything everyone said about them. Get them. The famous shrimp cocktail looked great. I'll get it next time. Also enjoyed the turkey avocado eggs benedict. They came with hash brown and it was perfect. Husband and I shared.

This is a solid breakfast of generous portions. An entrée is plenty. No need for additional sides. After eating this, I skipped lunch. Service was kind from all staff."	4	Du-Par's	4
"Prepare for a wait at dinner. Friday night was really busy, but if you want service you just smile at the waiter and lift your eyebrows. Be patient. The service was great. You'll see some familiar faces from Sushimon. The tables are really close so I wouldn't bring someone to tell them something personal or important or whatever.

We've all been to a billion sushi restaurants. This one is really good. At the same time so are a lot of other places. I guess what I'm trying to say is come here because it's another great place to get sushi.

Pork Belly- Thick chunks of pork with delicious fat still on it grilled until there's a pleasant char then they are covered in a sauce very familiar to me. This dish reminded me of childhood bbq's. So of course I loved it and been thinking fondly of it. Try it.

Spicy Tuna Rice Cracker- Drenched in yum and eel sauce, looks like too much, but it wasn't. Still able to taste the sticky, crunchy rice. Everyone loves spicy tuna. It was real yummy and I haven't seen it on another menu. Try it.

Yellowtail collar- Comes with a standard sauce. I love collar. It's a pleasure to pick out the variety of textures of meat in it. Like meaty parts away from the bone are drier and flaky. Then there's the darker moist parts you scrape off the bone, so good. I cleaned the bones. I love most grilled fish though so take my view as you will.

I always order mackerel sashimi. On this night it was generous pieces that were nice and oily. I love mackerel so much. I was happy with it here.

We also ordered a couple rolls, but they were standard. I can't even remember which ones they were. I remember they were good though."	4	Sushi House Goyemon	3.5
Great breakfast and dinner. American classics done finely. Really long wait for a reason. If you aren't starving wait the extra time for a booth because all other seating is very uncomfortable. Large portions and good microwaved the next day (usually hate leftovers). Cool alcohol selection. Sometimes workers dress up. Fun atmosphere. Feel free to bring the kids, but also good with adult food companions. Parking is good.	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
"BREAKFAST REVIEW

Above average service. Decor is nerdy.  In the same shopping center as the post office, Yayo Taco and the Lunch Box. It was empty.  

My lover and I shared the gogi waffle. It was pretty good. We also shared the belly rice. A fatty would need more food. How can I not be affectionate about Asian-American breakfasts? We took advantage of a deal they had- $5 for 2 sake bombs. I had a really good time that morning and it wasn't because of the drink. This was just a pleasant place to have breakfast."	3	28GO The Restaurant	4
Midtown disappointed me. If my friends and I weren't so timid and nice we would have walked out. What they advertise online- hours and menu items- is not accurate. They didn't have fries. It didn't look like they had pastries or coffee. Numerous things we asked for that were actually on the menu were out. No beer on tap. When we ordered sliders we got one, well, slider. I do have to say that the lobster pizza was really good. My husband and I shared our slider and the pizza. It was about $20 for that and we were not full so I don't recommend sharing. The waitress was having all kinds of problems processing our transaction. I felt embarrassed that we made our friends go there with us.	2	Midtown	3.5
"This is perfect for me. Dark and cave-like. Always good music on. Weird dude talking to himself making pasties. Beautiful bartenders that humor me when I draw pentagrams on my receipts and pout. Also they have craft beers on tap, not a million, but enough to keep me coming here nearly every weekend. I don't even feel like I'm in commercial center anymore. Even though the pasties are so rich and delicious sometimes I come here for beer and dessert only. I usually split a pasty with my husband and am very full after. The desserts are only $6 and are so good.

These are the best pasties:

The Royale- Flaky, buttery crust holds the contents of a burger, complete with patty cooked to your liking and actual French fries inside there. I recommend enjoying this with BBQ sauce and thousand island.

The Ruben- All my friends know that I love rubens. This is no exception. The experience is surrealistic and spiritual so I don't really have words for it. Must have thousand island with it. 

Here are more of my favorites:

Cream of Leek Soup- thick, rich, and salty. The potatoes are soft. This is true comfort food. The bread and butter are fresh too. I used to fill up on this and beer.

Mushroom Walnut Soup- Also thick. It's nutty and savory. I think this is my favorite soup here. Also served with fresh bread and butter. 

Oven Chips with Garlic and Jalapeno- No joke this is good. I love that I can tell that these fries were potatoes. I usually share this and a pasty with my husband and we get super full. 

Banoffee- Want to make a chef scream to the heavens in frustration? Order this. As much as I feel bad it's worth it because this giant dessert is superlative. You can share it with 4 people. The bottom is a thick gram cracker crust. Then it's covered in legit caramel sauce- THICK. On top of that is fresh whipped cream. Then it's topped with sliced bananas and sauce. The caramel middle is pure witchcraft.

Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding- I swear this is like eating a crunchy brownie soaked in some kind of sweet liquor chocolate sauce. I get mine with ice cream because it is so rich. It's so hard to share this one because it is truly amazing."	5	Cornish Pasty	4.5
"I've only been twice, but my last visit was not a good one.

The menu was not clear, like they had to erase stuff off of it, but said the item would be there in a half hour, but I never saw it. Then there was an item description, but no name. When I inquired about the description she simply put my order in for it. Turns out I was referring to the zorba. Ordinarily I'd say something, but it was such a pain to inquire\/redeem\/explain the check-in offer that I was over it. She did not know anything about the check in offer, but said she'd gladly give it to me. When I went to get my food there were no fries. The cook was like sorry, but I don't see any fries on here. I mean, you two are right next to each other. What's going on? So eventually I get my fries, but no one said, ""Here they are!"" I had to go up there and be like, ""Are those fries mine?"" Anyway, the food was just okay.

Thai meatballs: Two meatballs not especially large wrapped in lettuce that was brown and wilted on the edges. I mean, I'm still well, and it was inexpensive, but that sucks. The actual meatballs were sweet. I wish it was bigger.

Mac&Cheese: Very rich and tasty. This was the least disappointing part of my meal. The sauce was thick and the portion was just right. Pretty good for $4.

Sweet Potato Tots: Not too sweet and great with ketchup.

Ugh and the music! What torture! Even on the flippin' website. 

Maybe I'm just mad about this last visit. I don't like to give a bad review, but I don't think I'll be coming back."	2	Haulin Balls	3.5
"Finally a legit acai bowl in Vegas! The price is right too! Make sure you get a punch card. The customer service is approachable so talk about what you like. They will customize bowls to fit your taste. They have two sizes. I usually get the smaller size and feel full for my whole workday.

Don't know what an acai bowl is? Imagine eating a bowl of cereal full of chunks of fresh bananas and strawberries. Now imagine that instead of milk it's a berry smoothie. It's like eating dessert, but it's made with many healthy ingredients.

Body Builder- You'll hear customers ordering this acai bowl all day long. As a regular acai bowl eater I can really taste the peanut butter in this one. Relative to ones I've had these are creamy from the almond milk. Apple juice mellows out the acai too. Thank goodness they cut the toppings into bite-sized pieces. A generous amount of honey covers the top. The only thing this one is missing is fresh coconut flakes. These guys are so nice I bet they would put it on there for me. The bottom has the perfect amount of hemp granola.

Peanut Butter Lover- Naturally I had to try this pitaya bowl. Sure enough it has a strong peanut butter flavor. They were kind enough to let me try it with chopped almonds on top, which it usually doesn't and that made it even nuttier. The color of the pitaya is a startling pink, but it very mild and fruity. Don't be scared to try this one. Super good.

This place is great, but I do wish the seating was a little more ergonomic. Most of the table and chairs don't match and make the eating experience a little uncomfortable."	5	Bowlology	4
My food companion and I came here many times for dinner. She is memorable and they are kind to her. They are on top of everything. The food is good, mostly because it's Indian, but not superlative. I love the bollywood music videos and overhearing conversations in the next booth. We have heard many annoying ethnocentric, pseudo-open-minded weirdos here. The staff give me a twilight zone vibe, which is not to say they are bad. They just smile and look upon us for a long time and I don't know how to react to to the small talk. Anyway, this place is good and worthy of a visit. The parking lot is small and you have to drive around the back to exit. One time a car blocked the way and it was a nightmare.	4	India Palace	4
Saw they had an acai bowl on the menu, but it was just a $10 smoothie with granola and slivers of banana on top. Bad place for acai bowl. San Diego must have spoiled me. I was able to go anywhere and pick up an organic acai bowl for less than $10 and they were huge.	2	Go Raw Cafe	4
Thanks Dan for telling me about this place. Despite how unassuming it is from the outside it's great! Very casual. The price is right. The service is great. Check in and score a thai iced tea. We've been a couple times and our favorite was the panang. Even though the sauce looked thin we got flavor punched. If I wasn't such a sissy I would have gotten it spicier. Oh man and you gotta try those pot stickers. They are smothered in sauce and it's actually good. Everything we ever gotten was so good. The portions are so generous--plenty leftovers! Protip- try not to get that table right by the door. Also, weird tidbit, they have a scientology book on display behind the counter.	5	Thai Food To Go	4.5
"You should let the hype wear off a bit. It's so popular right now they packed the place to the brim with tables. It's hard to get around and tell where the food is. The plates come in two sizes: small and less small. Many dishes are on single serving dishes. Three fit on a plate. So I transferred my food over to my plate leaving behind the dish. I felt like a jerk leaving a stack of tiny dishes behind, but it's so hard to get through all the tables to my table that I wanted to minimize the amount of times I walked back and forth. The major con of this is my food got cold. My food got cold because the buffet is so busy that you have to wait at each station. It is true that many items were indeed mislabeled or not labeled at all. But the food was great! And the people that work there, despite being pushed to the limits of being busy, provided excellent customer service.

Now on to the food. 
Must have:
Both varieties of Mac & Cheese- it's sinful, oily, rich. One with crispy cheese on top. The other with crunchy bread crumbs.
Prime Rib with the Sauce- the meat was red and juicy. Make sure you eat the fat. Beware, I had to wait many minutes to get to this station.
Sliders- cooked to medium, oozing cheese. Looks like some were not as good as others though so choose wisely.
All the Dim Sum- I could eat a million sesame balls.
Flavored Honeys- Get a piece of bread (it's everywhere) and dip. The vanilla honey was the bees knees.

Overhyped:
Crab Legs- They are cut in half and still frozen. I don't know if it's just me, but every time I have them cut in half they taste way too salty. Try to find the claw pieces. At least they are sweet.
Shrimp and Grits- The grits seemed undercooked and flavorless. The flavor combo is more impressive on paper.

But the thing that really made my experience was the DESSERT section. No other place can compare. I should have eaten dessert all night. PHENOMENAL. It's far better in terms of variety AND quality than Studio B.
Macaroons in many flavors. Perfect, the way the outside caves in to a chewy mild flavor. I ate 3.
Gelato flavor like no one else. I had one scoop each of 3 flavors because it was offered to me (what a nice guy). The butter caramel is rich, but didn't compare to my other two flavors. Balsamic and Fig had chunks of sticky fig, harmonious. The best was the Aztec Chocolate. Spicy, chocolate, complex flavor that pleasantly lingers on the tongue.
Soufflé made fresh. It was still rising when she handed it me. You have to find the sign on top the bar and ask for it. I thank the kind stranger who guided me to it. The soufflé was hot and gooey inside with a subtle banana flavor.
Real marshmallows! Totally not obnoxious. They were light and sugary. I had a single pink one.
Some tiny cone filled with chocolate pudding? On a stick. Whoa, dunno what it was, but delicious. It tasted like they snuck a tiny bit of salt in it.
Three varieties of Crème Brulee: vanilla, chocolate, and hazelnut. I chose hazelnut. I couldn't taste the hazelnut, but the texture was spot on."	4	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"Tiabi is on the Maryland Parkway side of the Target shopping center. Right now they have a tarp sign that says something to the effect of ""Coffee and Waffles"" instead of their name.

Although there is a chalkboard menu on the wall grab a menu to get the full details of the items. Order your food at the counter. Ordering was slow when I went, but hopefully will get better with time. Then find your own seat. I would recommend ordering 2 wafflewiches since they do not come with sides (besides chips) or adding items to your sandwich to make it bigger. They are petit. Here's what we ordered:

Break the Fast Wafflewich- The actual waffle is delicious. I like that it's a little sweet. It's also a harmonious texture combo- sturdy and moist. Inside were scrambled eggs, thin bacon, and cheese. The items inside were sparse and the bacon was the thin kind. The price is right (about $5), but I would gladly pay more for a fuller sandwich. I think next time I will ask for extra eggs and maybe avocado on the side.

B.A.T Wafflewich- Same great waffle housing bacon, arugula, tomato, and a delicious sauce. We also wished this sandwich was fuller. The tomatoes were great. I bet this one would be great with avocado.

Regular Coffee- I drink mine black. This coffee was a-ok and came in a to go cup.

Iced Americano- Also a-ok and definitely caffeinated.

I'll definitely be back now that I have a better idea of what to order. Businesses in this area need our support so give Tiabi a try."	3	Tiabi Coffee & Waffle	4.5
Great service. I expressed interest in the Poke Express next door and they offered to bring my order over to eat with my Island Sushi food. But once I looked at the menu I decided there was plenty there for me to enjoy. My husband thought the pieces were small, but I was content with the portions. We ordered: Hamachi Kama- generous meaty yummy, Rainbow Roll- lots of fish on top, Mackerel Nigiri. The sushi has no frills. David S said something about the fish being warm. Mine was very room temperature, but nothing happened to me. The atmosphere is casual relative to other places. It's connected to Poke Express. On my way out I got dessert over there. All in all it was an a-ok lunch experience.	3	Island Sushi & Grill	4
Slow service so have plenty of time. LOVE the food here. I recommend almond boba, the ronin burger, steamed buns, fish chips, and hot sake. My kind of night! Art on the wall is cool too. This place isn't for everyone. Seating is a little uncomfortable and you can here everyone else's dumb conversations. You also have to have a palate for this stuff. Also, hard to see from the street so keep your eyes peeled.	5	Bachi Burger	4
"Take Settebello and imagine if it was Chipotle. Except they are patient and explain the toppings they have. You choose a pizza from the menu, but you can put less or more ingredients. Great quality ingredients, especially that olive oil. If they ask if you want olive oil on top you must say yes! It's reasonably priced and comes out fast.

Caprese: Great quality cheese. This salad is giant. I felt like a jerk enjoying this cheese monster. So good.

Bianco - Pesto, Gorgonzola, roasted onions, fresh Mozzarella, Truffle Arugula. If you are a arugula lover, this pizza is great. Don't mess it up by adding too much to it. It is great on its own.

Roma - Margherita with Pancetta, brown egg, cracked pepper, grated Romano cheese.  The egg makes this pizza. Super savory.

Naples - Marinara, Bufala Mozzerella  basil, EVO, grated cheese. I like this pizza, but always find myself adding pancetta and olives to it. I should just appreciate the simplicity of it.

If you get one of those coffee sodas, watch out because they all are super carbonated and foam over.

I feel sorry for all the people who blindly walk into Smashburger passing this place by. It's really good."	5	Novecento Pizzeria	4
Im not really into eating at expensive restaurants but I decided to give this one a try.  I was in Las Vegas so at least one really nice meal was in order.  I ordered the sword fish with duck liver and pear.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the duck liver was a sweet little addition.  It was all served over a cooked pear and covered in a truffel sauce. It was quite fantastic.  The fish plate cost $38 and a glass of wine was about $10.  The building is round is shape so all the noise bounces around the restaurant all night long which made it a little difficult for conversation.  The chef also has some sort of an obsession with Humpty Dumpty.  Overall, it was a nice dining experience that fit with Vegas.  I have definitely spent less than $60 before for a better meal.  Otherwise, I would go if your in the mood for something fancy.	4	David Burke	4
This place used to be so good but the food quality in both the burgers and fries are now disappointing. I don't know what they changed but nothing tastes the way it did before.	2	I Love Burgers	3
Went there for lunch and the staff was very slow. By the time I got my sandwich they had made it on the wrong bagel. I didn't even bother asking for it to be fixed because it took so long.	2	Einstein Bros	2
First of all we had an amazing livingsocial voucher, so for value wise our experience was a 5 stars. But for everyone else would we recommend this place? First of all there was only 1 bartender, who told us she was the only one working like 10 times, but she was sweet. I had a Philly Cheese steak and fries and it was excellent and only $9. My girl friends burger was hand made and grilled to perfection and the onion rings were great. My bloody Mary was awful, really, how can you mess one up, but it was bad. As people came in for lunch the bartender became more panicked, again, she was sweet. The management should have an assistant at all times, especially because some people want to eat and not just drink. This location is hard to get to and not very convenient, but it appears to be a place where locals would have a good time at. Would I go back? With a coupon or voucher, he'll yes.	3	Tommy Rocker's Mojave Beach Bar & Grill	3.5
If your a foodie then pass on this place, if you like incredible bar tenders who give you free drinks which are stiff then come and enjoy the show. The biggest question is, even without a coupon would I come back, the answer is hell yes. When there to have 6 drinks between me and my girl, but wound up staying 3 hours and eating diner. I would review the food because it's just ok, but the bar scene is fantastic, really it is.	4	Kahunaville Island Restaurant	3
I've been going to this restaurant since I was little! Their meatballs are to die for, and the veal Parmesan is always so amazing! My favorite dish is the gnocchi! This is my favorite Italian place in Las Vegas! Rebecca is our favorite server. She's always attentive, sweet, and witty. It always looks like Christmas inside. If you're looking for an Italian dinner, this is the place!	5	Rao's	3.5
Didn't have the pleasure of dining at this place because the service was horrendous and we ended up leaving before we even ordered. A waitress came to take our order and gave us our drinks quickly. She didn't explain to us that she was taking drink orders but was not the waitress. When I asked her to make an order, she told me she would send over the waiter. I was totally fine with that.  The waiter was gentleman that had been standing there looking at me for 5 minutes. And I saw him waive the woman off and continue to do nothing after she had told him about our request. I complained to the host and he was completely unhelpful. He simply said that the server had a big table. He handled it completely wrong and passed the buck to the manager. It was an overall lack of teamwork on their part and terrible customer service.	1	The Coffee Shop	2.5
3 of us tried 3 different ramens and all were very good! The crunch roll and green salads were really good as well. We will definitely be back!	5	Ichi Ramen House	4
We are not very impress at all with the selection and the taste. We are currently sitting here and trying to enjoy our time here. I would not recommend it if you are trying to find a good selection of food. I expected better for the price being near to Bacchanal Buffet.  Our server is really nice and has been doing his rounds.	2	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
This place should be called pan roast\/gumbo bar instead. Their selection of oysters was kind of disappointing, they only have gold band oysters. I've been here several of times but I feel like it's been disappointing me lately. I like how they're open 24\/7 but I forewarn you that there will always be a long line. I suggest getting the pan roast or gumbo here. The oyster shooters, not so much.	3	Oyster Bar	4.5
"The best pizza in Vegas. 

My family and I are hooked! 

Anthony's white pizza is amazing. We've tried several things like their wings and chicken fingers and not once have we been disappointed. Thank you Broadway's."	5	Broadway Pizzeria	4
State of he art service matched the quality of the food.  We ate in abundance solely because we had such genuine service from this place.  The food speaks for itself and its a must if you love southern cuisine.	5	Yardbird Southern Table & Bar	4.5
TERRIBLE SERVICE AND FACILITATION.  Not only was my food delivered to my table cold, but when it was remade the general manager handed me a tray very non apologetic (in open toed sandals might I add), and had no regards or one care in the world for what my family and I were experiencing.  I wouldn't recommend this place to my worse enemy.	1	Carl's Jr	2.5
"I would give this place 5 stars because the food was out of this world but I gave it 4 stars due to the wait. They were featured in a show so the popularity grew. They need to get a bigger place because this place was very small. There were about 10 seats at the counter and maybe 3 booths, if I'm correct. The first time I was here was almost 2 years ago and I have been hooked since. I knew that every time I come back to Vegas, I had to stop here. It wasn't popular at the time so there was no wait time and we stayed almost 3 hours on a Saturday and also got to try some lunch sandwiches. I think there were 4 of us and we each did the 3 course dessert for $25 and we each ordered different desserts so that we could try them all. I love that they make everything in front of you. 

This time we waited about 30-45min but again it was worth it. It was hot but they had some iced lemon water for us. Sweets Raku was the reason I came back to Vegas so I had to drop by no matter what. We stopped by on a weekday so they opened at 6pm (Mon-Fri, closed Wed?). Therefore the sandwiches weren't available, just desserts. Last time they had edible menu that you tear and dip in this fruity sauce almost like chips and salsa which they currently are not serving. This time they didn't have the 3 course dessert for $25 but 2 course for $15 which came with a sorbet and a main dessert.  But what we did was saved $3 and ordered all the different kinds of desserts for $12 each and shared. There were 4 of us again but I think there were 5 main desserts so we got to try them all. Most of the desserts were the same as 2 years ago but had different flavors this time. They all still tasted amazing and so rich with flavors. Our bill came out to $100 so $25 each. So if you're the owner reading this, please get a bigger place or open from 12pm to midnight on weekdays too, not just the weekends. I would really appreciate that and so would everyone else."	4	Sweets Raku	4.5
This is one of the many places I have to stop by when I'm in Vegas. This time we were at #2 and they didn't have fresh crayfish, only frozen ones. I guess #1 was also out of fresh ones too. I thought frozen ones would taste rubbery because that's how they taste like when I buy frozen ones at the store. I got to sample some and they weren't bad so we decided to stay and order them. Pictures doesn't do justice so stop by when you're in Vegas. We stopped at the gelato place next door afterwards and they could smell the crayfish in our clothes lol	5	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
My friend showed me a video on Facebook about the Donut Bar and the creme brulee looked amazing so I knew we had to stop by when we were in Vegas. My friend actually went to the Donut Bar by Fremont Street and got us donuts while we stayed back at our hotel with our babies. The creme brulee were to die for, the donuts with the poptart in the middle were huge, almost the size of my 2 month old, and they were so rich and fulfilling. See my video...	5	Donut Bar	4.5
I don't normally eat burgers but I had to try it because my friend Amy kept on talking about it. I got the fish sandwich and it was huge. The bread was very moist and toasted to perfection. It almost seems like each bread was baked or taken out of the oven when a sandwich is ordered. I love bread and I loved the bread on my sandwich  and it made my sandwich tasted so much better. Amy ordered a turkey burger. I love the cranberry sauce that was on it. Lee ordered I believe the Ramsay's burger. It was OK. Ekka also ordered a fish sandwich. All the burgers were huge, more than enough for one person. We also ordered alfredo fries and another fries. I liked the alfredo fries. It was new to me and very rich, almost like eating alfredo pasta. I gave it a 4 star just because they made us waited even though there were empty tables and we were very hot with 2 infants with us. We had walked over to Planet Hollywood  from our hotel in the afternoon.	4	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
I love how there were so many options to choose from, I mean it was a world buffet and we ate about half of what was available, mostly the seafood section. However, I came for the seafood and I thought the seafood was better at the Village Seafood Buffet when it was separate from the Carnival World Buffet. There were also more desserts and gelatos to choose from at the Village Seafood Buffet. Anyways, food was still good. I gave it a 4 star this time just because there weren't as many seafood and dessert options when it was just Village Seafood Buffet.	4	Carnival World & Seafood Buffet	2.5
"We craved fresh healthy chicken and drove to this place from southern highlands! (27 min away) We wanted to try everything so we ordered the 20
Piece family meal for two people! Hahah 
It was well worth it! We couldn't decide which chicken was better, the fried (which isn't too greasy at ALL) the grilled or baked. Amaze! The Mac and cheese hands down! I'll go just for that. Bassicly, everyone go support this place so they can expand locations! Thanks

My wife and I travel the world and often look for a place to play pool. Griffs is by far the most comfortable pool room we've ever seen in the USA. In addition to the excellent pool shooting conditions, the food and service were first class.	5	Griff's	4.5
Do yourself a favor and a solid and go there for the $22.14 lunch. You don't even have to "upgrade" to the more expensive stuff to have a tremendous dining experience. Great service, just right. For the appie, I got the Nova Scotia salmon, basically on a bagel with red onions, cream cheese and capers. Terrific. My entree I cannot stop talking about. I would have paid $30+ just for it. Salmon pan-seared with the skin on, medium rare. Like butta. The best salmon I think I've ever had. That's saying a lot. I am normally reluctant to order salmon out...My wine was $18 but well worth it, just for a glass. It was the Greek Domaine Biblia Chora, Pangee. Sorry, don't remember the vintage. It was red. It was so lovely I couldn't stop smelling it. You know a wine is superior when you just want to make slow sweet love to it for over an hour, like I did. One glass was perfect though I will be looking for that exact wine at BevMo or what have you.	5	Estiatorio Milos	4
Great mexican seafood. Very clean and friendly service. Bring an extra shirt!! Molcajete is tasty tasty but bring a shirt :)	5	Cevicheria El Diamante	4
"the wait is at least an hr long!!! it's like black Friday everyday here at golden corral

anyway, the food is okay, there is a line for pan-fried\/grill fish. and their steak was whatever.. everything here is average or below average...

my friends raved about this place and i had really high hope for it. and of course i was disappointed because there is a line everywhere and the food wasnt as great as expected

i think my review for this place is biased because i was expecting a lil too much for a $10 buffet. i've been wanting to go back and give it a try one more time"	3	Golden Corral	3
There are others in the business who claim to be better, and this pizza is always awesome.  I order almost once a week, and it always rules.  Their homemade ranch sauce is the best!  Not an oily pizza, either.  When you lift your piece off, the cheese is real and stays in place, and there's no 'oil spill' under the slice.  Love them, and REASONABLY PRICED THE BEST PART!  Always on time and friendly, too.  Wish they were open on Mondays, though......would be great with MNF! :)	5	Verrazano Pizza	4
OMG THE BEST YOU CANNOT GO WRONG.  My husband is a meat and potato guys and is hooked now at Juice N Go!! Staff is super cool too!! Love it that it's not chain-y.!  We always have a fun time coming to the drive through and looking forward to patronizing this location. Don't compromise a thing and keep up the awesome work!	5	Juice 'N' Go	4.5
What the heck is 'due rounding'? Can you please not do that. No other retailer does that. You're just stealing money from customers. Basically, depending on the total price of your purchase he will add or subtract pennies... Otherwise the food is awesome. A bit on the pricier side for fast food but is consistently amazing so they get away with it.	3	Strip N Dip Chicken Strips	4.5
Unpretentious.  Leave those snobs up West.  Or South.  Sushi on Rainbow keeps it 'real'--no frills, no attitude, no princessness in the air.....the freshest, most valuable Sushi in Vegas.  Been going here since 1998!!  Keep doing what you are doing; it works!!	5	Sushi On Rainbow	3.5
It kills me to leave this review.  The food itself and array of food deserves five stars, however it's the staff that screws it up each and every time.  No exaggeration.  Every time something goes wrong that is truly annoying, such as getting cold cold soup served before your guest's  entree arrives EVEN IF THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO THINGS ORDERED (?) , a tuna melt comes out not melted and cold, etc, with the blessed receipt describing the order on the tray.  (?)   The timing of the food execution is horrible.!!! You can even see the staff standing in the back on top of each other waiting to take hot food out that is sitting on this massive counter without a heat lamp.   Hard to watch.  Hard to watch staff just stand around and talk when they best be grateful to be working in the first place....  THE BEST PART OF THE WHOLE THING: there are set positions in the kitchen where there are many hands that look over the order before it goes out, a manager or 'expediter'.....???? What is with the expediter?  Looking all dapper and bringing a mediocre, EVERY TIME, tray.   This, seriously? is a CONSTANT at this particular establishment.  The staff ruins the food experience.  Not cool, especially in today's economic market.  Panera is consistently great, especially in the service department.  This place needs to get its act together big time.Again the food rocks but the staff is an impediment.	2	Jason's Deli	3.5
An amazing experience from start to finish. The employees are super friendly,  outgoing and treated the business as if it were their own. Employees excited about working there and all the different experiences they have working there and take pride in their work. Today, complements to the owners! I had the carne asada dog which was out of this world. Sweet potato fries were amazing as well with that spicy mayo to die for! My husband had the Chicago style hotdog which knocked it out of the park for being in the desert! I love the Korean twist and cannot wait to try the more exotic dishes! Dying to try the hangover soup! Thanks for keeping the pricing real as well. Very clean establishment. Will patronize many times in the future thank you so much!	5	Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dogs	4.5
Way overpriced tiny portions service is very weird there.	1	Biscuits Cafe	3.5
They have never messed up an order, which is huge, for over a year and a half, when I discovered them having moved from LA.  Never ever.  As well, always consistently delicious.  Super fast delivery!!!  Not pretentious, NO MSG, white meat chicken!, and best of all a super sweet staff.  Not one error ever.  That says something about a joint.  The best, and AFFORDABLE, on the Westside.  If you go anywhere else it's either for an 'atmosphere' thing.  Or you want cheap fast food Chinese like Panda Express.  Otherwise, the best in the biz.	5	Pearl Wok To Go	3.5
The whiz!!!  lol the best late nite munchie food on the Westside!  Love it!	5	Pop's Philly Steaks	3.5
Oooohh everyone loves Cane's!  Can't get enough of Cane's!  Quality, HUGE servings, amazing amazing amazing indescribable chicken.  Sauce rules too.  So does their texas toast.  Every time we have guests from out of town this is a sure hit! A must on the list!	5	Raising Cane's	3.5
Thank you Upper Management for addressing my issues, like immediately!! Speaks highly of the corporation, as well as  their caring for Military personnel\/families as well!!!! We love JR, especially the banana milkshakes and sweet potato fries! We'll definitely be back for more!!	5	Johnny Rockets	3.5
OMG the best, freshest truly truly authentic Mexican food this side of the border.  The pina coladas were to die for; to die for.  The ceviche was HUGE and out of this world fresh.  Real fresh fish!  I had to leave a little to make room for the Mole Poblano which was amazing.  My husband had fish tacos and I never heard him surface for air the entire meal.  The staff is super cool, too.  Beautiful atmosphere, super authentic.  The bathrooms are so cute!!  Super clean, too.  Will most definitely go to again and again!!!	5	Bonito Michoacan	4
Loved it!  Had the select stone crabs which were awesome and so was the half shell oysters.  Do NOT get the mac and cheese though.  It was dry and not very cheesy at all.  We also had the bacon wrapped scallops which were yummy.  I was so full I didn't get to eat any desserts but next time I will try to key lime pie.	5	Joes Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab	4.5
My partner and I walked to therapy from the busy casino area. We got a warm welcome from the whole staff, especially the owner, and during a busy Saturday night they kept us updated about our wait. After about 10 minutes we were seated. The food was amazing and the service was great! When we got the bill we were shocked on how much it was. We would have paid double for what we got. Would recommend this restaurant. We will go here again the next time we visit Vegas!	5	Therapy	4
This place is incredible. The food is great. The drinks are great.  The price is very reasonable.  The service is always stellar. Irvin is the best waiter we've had so far. Go visit him for brunch and bottomless mimosas. You won't see the bottom of your glass.	5	Echo & Rig	4.5
Great place to stop if you want a burger, or a cold beer. Good beer selection and very friendly staff!!	5	Flippin' Good Chicken, Burgers, Beer	4
This buffet at the Aria may have a great price, but the food with the exception of the pastries had no flavor. I would suggest the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, it was way better.	1	Buffet of Buffets	4
"Mac Shack, Mac Shack, Mac Shack...

You got me mackin' over some pasta =) If you're a pasta lover like myself, you will appreciate this place. I love that it's located right around the corner from my place.

Anyways, my review will be based solely on my to-go experience and the shrimp scampi I ordered. I am not one to discriminate against pastas; I love and adore all equally, but have recently grown an obsession for shrimp scampi. I've made it myself before, but on days when I want pasta and don't feel like putting the minimum effort in cooking I will invest in to-go pasta. I truly believe the shrimp scampi is for pasta lovers that do NOT like creamy pasta sauces. The wine sauce is a good amount for this dish and they are giving with the shrimp and pasta. I must say that the garlic bread isn't that great which can explain the 4 stars. It just wasn't ""garlic-y"" enough and not soft enough for my liking.

The place itself is very spacious and has a warm light to it. The cashier counter have a nice display of ""fake"" pasta and dishes they make. I enjoyed the staff as well since they were very friendly. 

I will be back to a dine-in experience, so my review will be updated.. HOWEVER, for now I say I am a Mac Shack fan!"	4	Mac Shack Spring Valley	3.5
"Tootsie roll on over to this poke place.

You. Won't. Regret. It.

These chipotle style places are on the come up - that is the best way for me to describe restaurants like this. You have signature dishes you can choose from, but the lovely lady suggested we make our own since we can pick and choose what we want.

They offer 3 different sizes - small, medium, or large. You're give the option between white or black rice along with rice reasoning. They have a wide selection of meat. I chose yellowtail, tuna, and salmon. They have a wide variety of sauces - I was recommended the garlic ponzu. I'm a garlic lover, so it was an excellent choice. I also had the meat mixed with yum yum sauce. Lastly, you have your toppings to choose from. 

They have a miso soup machine, which I found quite interesting. I mean... Let's be honest. How many of you have seen a miso soup machine?

Some perks that they have is quick sushi pick-up to go. They have freshly made, already packed sushi rolls that you can just buy. They also have a good amount of Japanese snacks near the registrar!

I'm coming back. 

End of story."	5	To See Roll	4.5
"The curry Gods have heard and answered my prayers.

They finally made a Curry Zen closer to me, so now I get to avoid all the traffic down Spring Mountain *fist pump*

Anyways, besides the upgraded interior and new location, it's pretty much the same thing. The menu is the same and spice levels are the same.

You would think that after eating tons of spicy ramen I'd move up from a 3, but unfortunately I can only handle a 3 *cue sad music*

Also! Don't forget to order some takoyaki while you're here. It's mini balls of octopus which is a lot more delicious than I'm letting on. 

Thank you Curry Zen for moving closer to this side of town."	5	Curry Zen	4
"My greasy, guilty pleasure.

I really like the look of this drive-thru. There's 2 lanes, but rarely do I ever see the other one opened. You can sit outside and enjoy your meal if the weather permits.

My favorite order here is their double bacon cheeseburger. YOU MUST ORDER THEIR SEASONED FRIES. They are amazing! Their fully loaded fries are equally enjoyable as well. 

I'm only rating this place a 3 due to my most recent visit. The ranch was extremely oily =( I couldn't enjoy my meal how I usually do because of this.

Overall, this isn't a bad place to grab lunch or dinner at."	3	Checkers	2.5
"I see myself getting all my future grocery shopping done here.

This place is amazingly HUGE! There's signs outside saying it was rated Las Vegas's Best Grocery Store so I figured I'd take a look to see what the hype was about.

This market place has a bakery, butcher, deli, and an ice cream\/gelato place. I was totally not expecting that. They even have a separate section for organic foods which I didn't really get a chance to inspect, but appeared to have a good selection. This store is huge. You definitely don't think it would be from the outside, but it is.

May this place continue to be Las Vegas' #1 grocery store."	5	Glazier's Food Marketplace	3.5
"I was a fan of the first one and now I'm a fan of the second one.

I cannot even fathom my excitement when I found out a SkinnyFATS was being opened on the Southwest part of the Valley not to mention this location was going to be almost TWICE as big.

The menu hasn't changed, but the decor definitely has improved. There's an outside seating area and a cool ""high table"" where the chairs are made of crates and pillows are stacked on. This place is definitely a good date night location especially if you're able to land a table outside because of the lights. If you're not a fan of the outside, don't worry.. You can seat yourself inside in front of their huge projector television screening.

I love this restaurant and will return shortly. (If you want a more detailed review, please refer to my SkinnyFATS review off their Industrial location)"	5	SkinnyFATS	4.5
"If you live in the deep west side of the Valley... You will appreciate this location! It literally is walking distance from my house and is in such a great plaza.

Anyways, this location is a decent size. The service is ""on point"" though. They are usually very quick on seating you. Just like all the other reviews - BWW is the perfect place to watch your sports shows. It gets really packed and full of energy during college basketball season, especially when the Rebels are playing.

My go-to order is a toss up between the honey bbq, chicken parmesan, and mild wings. I almost always have to get a regular order of french fries or potatoe wedges with cheese. It's a must in my book anyways. They have a good drink menu. I love their bahama mama - its the perfect fruity drink for me.

To sum it up, if you're craving wings and are on the west side. Don't forget to hit this location up.

Tip: Try to go on a Tuesday or Thursday for their discount price on traditional and boneless wings. If you like traditional go on Tuesday and if you're a fan of boneless go on Thursday."	4	Buffalo Wild Wings	3.5
"You haven't had carne asada fries until you've tried here. I will never go back to Roberto's ever since I've had the ones they serve here. They hold their title of best carne asada fries in Las Vegas.

Anyways, moving on with the review.. This location is open 24 hours. The perfect place to sober up after a long night of drinking. The dining area is pretty spacious and resembles Roberto's. They're pretty quick on prepping your food so don't fret if you want food in your system asap.

I can't really judge much off the other items on their menu since I literally get carne asada fries each and every time. Trust me, you will too once you've had it."	4	Pepe's Tacos	2.5
"I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE TO EAT HERE! 

Am I the only one who is reminded of the Hunger Games because of this restaurant's name?

Let's start off with the appearance of this place. Let's just put it simply.. I feel pretty freakin' cool eating here. I definitely wouldn't mind having a photoshoot against their wall of typography. You'll know what I'm referring to once you go here. Look for the words: WTF (Where's The Food) pretty clever.

Let's move onto the menu. They keep everything pretty simple on a clip board and one sheet of paper. Yes, you read correctly... One. Sheet. Each order is pretty much broken down on the menu. They also have specials, so be sure to ask your server on that.

I ordered the steak and eggs both times. What can I say? If I like something, I really like something. The best part of this entree is the steak! It is seriously COOKED TO PERFECTION and even already cut into perfect bite sizes =') They give you a good portion size of rice and an egg on top. I'm seriously still in awe over how amazing their steak is. My boyfriend got their oxtail fried rice, which I found pretty darn tasty. My friend gets their garlic noodles. Who knew that garlic noodles could be so FLAVORFUL?! 

District One, you have definitely caught my heart and stomach. I'll be back to explore more of your menu soon."	5	District One	4
"What's better than burgers? Asian-infused BURGERS!

I love the fact that there's no waiting whenever I go here (I go around 8 o'clock). I'm usually seated right away which is already a good sign. We ordered the truffle parmesan fries with a special sauce that was to die for. I love the texture of the fries - not too crunchy, but not soggy.

I ordered a Kiki's burger last time I was here, so decided I wanted to try something new. Me and my boyfriend got the Miyagi burger and let me tell you it deserves a black belt. I love the fried onions with bacon and fried egg. Just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate, haha. It reminded me of a more sophisticated Tamago burger (from Fuku). 

I love this place and my boyfriend does too so we will definitely be back. We still have tons of burgers and entrees to try!"	5	Bachi Burger	4
"Welcome to Raising Canes where the chicken is kicking, the sauce is the boss, and the toast is the most!""

Kicking chicken? CHECK. Bossy sauce? CHECK. Most out of the toast? CHECK.

There's really nothing bad to say about this place unless you're anti-fast food OR hate waiting in drive thru lanes.

I LOVE that there's one located on the southwest side. It's very convenient for me =)

I will continue to come back here time after time."	4	Raising Cane's	4
"Awesome place to meet up with friends and just hang out.

It's located in downtown so you know this place has a lot of culture. Outside is the fire preying mantis which has been seen multiple times at First Friday. There's only one entrance so you can't really miss it. They don't allow outside drinks from what I heard.

There's a big Tarzan-esque playground in the middle with ""imaginative playground"" materials scattered across the play area in front. There's several shops and restaurants to eat at if you're here plus TONS of seating. If you've got an eye for art then this place is definitely for you. A lot of the stores feature art from local artists which is awesome. 

If you're planning on bringing your kids here do it well before 9 since they make the park a 21+ venue even with parental supervision. If you're in the park before 9 and are under 21 they may ask you to leave but I wasn't carded even tho I'm a 21 year old looking like I'm 16.

If you haven't been here yet and don't mind trying to find parking then you should definitely come here. The fact that it's located close to Insert Coins, Vanguard and Commonwealth makes it convenient. I just wish this place had a big parking lot or perhaps underground parking."	4	Downtown Container Park	4
"Maybe it's the secluded location or perhaps the strange after taste of the broth left on your tongue.

Whatever the case be, I really am not a fan of the place. The restaurant is pretty spacious with a karaoke stage to your left upon entering. There's a big ""fruit tree"" located in the middle which is a nice sight. However, the wait time for food is rather long. I went here with a group of 7 and had to wait about 40 minutes for food? Nothing comparable to Pho Kim Long (my go to place for pho).  

I'm pretty easily fulfilled with pho from any place, but I was just thrown off by the after taste of the broth as stated above. My final verdict? If you can get pho somewhere else - go for it."	2	Pho Hung Restaurant	3
"The BBQ chicken tasted a little too much like BBQ chicken and had me forget that I was eating a pizza. It was DRENCHED in BBQ sauce and had me regretting that me and my boyfriend ordered it. I had already ordered mild chicken wings as a appetizer and was actually wanting a pizza =(

Let me add that another couple was sitting near us and asked how the BBQ chicken pizza was and we had to tell the truth - ""order something else"".

They have a soda fountain available so you don't have to wait for your server to refill your drink for you. I guess it can be a hassle to get up to refill your drink though when it needs to be refilled so I guess it's all about how you look at it.

Our server though was skimpy on the napkins and ranch. My boyfriend asked for more ranch and she gave us just ONE MORE PACKET. I guess I'm just use to being given several servings of ranch, but that's just me.

The only good thing I can deduct from this place is that it is open 24 hours. That didn't really have an effect on me since I live in Las Vegas, but I guess it would be more convenient to anyone staying at Circus Circus wanting to get a late night bite."	3	Pizzaria	2.5
"I discovered this place from a couple of friends after watching Fifty Shades of Grey. (Obviously the movie pegged my appetite.. for food anyway, haha!)

Let's start off with the decor and the environment. The lighting is dim, which I didn't mind. The tables and chairs kind of bring me back to old Japan town or something. There's booth amongst the side and a HUGE table in the center - perfect for big parties

If you've ever ate at Monta Ramen then you'll notice the menu being very similar. I was recommended the spicy chicken ramen (mild) with added butter and tofu. I can handle my fair share of spiciness, but I wasn't sure how it would be here. If you rather be safe than sorry - go ahead and order a mild. They have their spicy powder available on the table for you to add to your heart's desire. The ramen was served in a huge bowl so it appeared to have larger portions than Monta Ramen (although I can't verify that). The dish was flavorful and delicious. Our friends ordered the Jinya bun that resembles a siapo (meaty, steamed bun) and creamy shrimp tempura (awesomeness on a small appetizer plate).

Now, the only reason why I rated it 4 stars was due to the fact that my side of tofu came pretty late =( The temperature heat of my noodles subsided a lot by the time I was delivered them.

Overall, I look forward to returning here. It definitely will change your view and taste palate for noodles. You'll never want to cook a packet of instant noodles ever again."	4	JINYA Ramen Bar	4
Great deal, great prime rib place for locals.  The prime rib is cooked perfectly every time.  The appetizers were not impressive; and the steak, ordered medium-rare, was served very well-done, and when asked to recook it came out rare and cold, but the 3rd time was a charm and finally came medium-rare.  Prime Rib Loft = stick with the prime rib.	4	Prime Rib Loft	3.5
We went to the restaurant to celebrate a friend's birthday. Walk in, great atmosphere & decor, we were ready for a great fine dining experience. The server was great in getting us settled & taking our orders, etc. And the deserts were AWESOME, best part of the meal. The bacon onion soup and my cocktail was really good too. However, I'm probably not going to go back because the service & the following were the deal breakers for me: (1) the appetizers were really over priced ($20 for 4 bites) (2) all the seafood entrees were not good (the steak was OK) (3) I had to send my salmon dish back because it was WAY over cooked, then it was served w\/ desert (4) they dropped our food on the way to the table and had us wait, serving all the food at all different times (which isn't that bad in itself - accidents happen) but then didn't make it up to us or apologize - even when I specifically asked. After dinner we headed up to the club since we were there, we were on the guest list luckily, club is super small, the place was way too crowded.	2	LAVO Italian Restaurant & Lounge	3.5
We had a gift certificate they gave us to make up for the bad service last time.  We had a big group so it was understandable that they took a long time to get our food to us.  Overall the entrees were very good and the whole experience was acceptable.	3	Grand Lux Cafe	4
It's the place to get a burger.  It's a tradition for our group of friends when we visit Vegas to head over to Burger Bar for dinner.  Build your own burger with best ingredients.  Sides are good too.  100% of the time I've gone to Burger Bar, my burger is cooked perfectly the way I order.  For fresh fancy burgers, medium rare is the way to go in my opinion.  Plus, this week when went, for the 1st time we ordered the Kobe Burger to see what the hype was about.  YUM.  Kobe Burger lives up to it's hype for sure.  (oh and once, a friend ordered veggie patty and vinaigrette salad, she wasn't super happy with her meal).  Burger Bar = stick w\/ the burgers.	5	Burger Bar	4

"When you've got the late night munchies and can't figure out where else to go... The Peppermill is open 24 hours. 

The location is a bit tricky and although it's right by Wynn, you'll need a taxi. 

It's a fun atmosphere with an old Vegas feel.

I like that when looking at the menu, I'm reminded a bit of home with the typical diner menu choices as opposed to all of the fancy restaurant menus on the strip.

We had a sampler appetizer of some sort that came with fried shrimp, onion rings and mozzerella sticks. Everything was pretty good.

For my entree, I ordered the Ruben, which was huge and overflowing with fries. Just as everyone says, the portions are large. The Ruben was good. The Cheesesteak was also really good.

Also had the Brownie Sundae which was yum and the Coffee was great. 

Really sweet and attentive waitress. 

I had an overall good experience with this place. Good food, good portions, good prices and good service. I don't know if I'd really go out of the way to go to this place though. The food is just average. If it was in my hometown, it'd be nothing special."	3	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
"Encore by day. Surrender by night.

This double used club is amazing in size. I went on a Friday morning\/afternoon and came out exhausted which means I had fun, obviously. The wait to get in isn't very long, then again we arrived 13 minutes after it opened. I believe it's free for locals on Friday so if you're local, you're 21+, and you're free on Fridays.. Com'on down! They offer open bar for ladies from 1-2 with mimosas and rum being the selected drink. There was a Captain Morgan cabana that had ladies offering free white rum drinks ~ delicious, delicious is all that comes to mind.

The thing that I really like about Encore\/Surrender is the multiple seating they offer around the plants, lol. We all know that to get seating anywhere in clubs it usually means playing or going through a club promoter BUT! Encore\/Surrender has a benches that wrap around the trees\/plants that you can sit on =)

I don't usually do day clubs, but have come to the conclusion that I will go to this one if needed."	5	Encore Beach Club	4
"Buffets.. A place to binge on almost any kind of food you can imagine. You would think almost every buffet on the Strip deserves a 4 or 5 star rating, but there are exceptions.

Let's start off with the fact that the waiting line is located super close to some of the dining areas. My group was seated near the entrance of the buffet and the line got ridiculously long that some of the people were standing right in front of us. Normally this wouldn't really be that much of a problem, but it does when they are standing in the way of me and my path to food.

Its your average buffet with food ranging from mediterranean to asian to mexican to seafood. I'm a seafood lover so I will ALWAYS find myself heading straight to the crab legs ;) What can I say? I want to get my moneys worth. This buffet has 2 small trays with crab legs =( It's quite depressing when I'm use to the World Carnival Buffet at the Rio having a HUGE selection on crab legs. I still found myself getting 2 plate servings though. If there's crab legs, I'm eating it.

Nothing else was really appealing to me. I had some of their 3-cheese ravioli which I found too heavy even for italian food. The pesto alfredo was alright - nothing worth raving about OR putting down. I guess the last thing I can add about this place is it is poorly lit. It's a little dim for my liking, but that's a personal preference.

All in all, this buffet may just be a pass for me. There are better buffets out there with higher quality in food and bigger selections."	3	Spice Market Buffet	3
"One of my favorite places to go - hands down.

I believe this was my second night club going when I turned 21, but I will continually go back due to always having a fun time. If there's one thing I love about this place its the VARIETY of music. Nowadays all you hear at clubs are EDM and nothing else, but the DJs here really know how to showcase variety and give their guests an amazing time.

I just wish this place was bigger =( It's so cramped and small inside. Once it gets packed, its pretty hard to maneuver yourself anywhere. Anyways.. don't sleep on this place."	5	Hyde Bellagio	3.5
"You don't have to go to the Eiffel Tower on the Strip to get a taste of Paris.

This little cafe is set right off the 2-15W and Sunset, in a medical office plaza. It's right before Southern Hills Hospital.

My favorite item on the menu is their Croque Monsieur Sandwich which is ham and cheese (at least that's what I think, haha). They usually serve it on a baguette, BUT I asked if it could be done on a croissant and they happily obliged! I'm not sure if salad and a cantaloupe is served with all their meals, but their sandwiches do. This place also serves macarons and other French desserts.

As far as decor goes, this place had such a quaint and home-like vibe that reminded me of Paris so much. I started reminiscing about our recent trip to Europe.

I've definitely been back more than once and plan to keep it that way! 

Merci Le Petite Cafe for the delicious food."	5	Le Petit Café & Bakery	4.5
"Steggs.

That's pretty much all I need to say about this place (joking), but honestly though. Whenever I'm trying to sober up from a night of drinking, this place comes on top of the list next to two others. Besides the actually steak and eggs themselves, I love that this place is located near the Strip. It comes in handy when you've spend a long night drinking whether it be in a club or at a hotel party. 

The ONLY thing that keeps it from becoming a full 5 stars is the fact they have a certain time limit and day when parties aren't able to do split checks which kind of makes it inconvenient when you're sobering up and forgot to carry cash on you and your card limit has been completely maxed out due to heavy drinking.

All in all, definitely a good sober up place."	4	Marilyn's Cafe	4
"Brio is the perfect place to have that romantic date you've been meaning to have with your significant other.

I went to the Summerlin location for Valentine's Day and was impressed. They take both reservations and walk-ins so lucky for us since we didn't make a reservation. The estimated wait time was 80 minutes? But we actually got in earlier, probably 30 to 40 minutes?

Anyways... We ate outside near a heat lamp which wasn't too bad in today's weather. We ordered calamari as our appetizer which was fine. I mean, it's calamari... Not much else to it. For our entrees, I got the pasta brio which is grilled chicken with rigatoni. My boyfriend got campenelle carbonara which kind of resembled chicken Alfredo. I also got a flirtini - probably won't get that again. It resembled cough syrup to me, but that could just be my taste buds.

All in all, for $67 this was definitely not a bad place for a date. We will probably check out the one in Town Square once the weather gets warmer since they have a fire pit outside.

Happy eatings!"	4	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
"I've been going to the California Hotel for years and never really thought about dining here. My boyfriend was the one who selected this place for a surprise date he had planned. We didn't make reservations, but only took about 20 minutes for us to get seated which I gotta say isn't bad for a Friday night!

The food was pretty good, but I can't really say much since I almost always get chicken fettuccine alfredo and that to me always taste delicious. The ONLY negative thing I have to really say against this place is our seating. It was hard to concentrate on eating due to the beaming, bright red light hanging over us. I know it ties into the theme of ""pirate"", but it just made it difficult for me to eat my food."	4	Pasta Pirate	3.5
"Let me just start off by saying that I am NOT from my Chicago. My fiancé lived there for almost a year, but he's a Bears and Cubs fan, thus, making me a Cubs fan.

Anyways, we decided yesterday we wanted to watch Game 2 of the Cubs and Dodgers, but we didn't want to watch it alone. We wanted to watch it with fellow Cubs fans, DUH! 

Yelp didn't disappoint.

Our searches led us to this bar and we couldn't be more happier! Immediately upon pulling into the parking lot, we saw the Cubs logo on the front. We walked into the bar and instantly saw a good amount of people in Cubs gear and Chicago sports team decoration EVERYWHERE. It was pretty awesome.

Most of the tables were taken, but we found a good spot in the middle of the bar. The whole bar has TVs everywhere playing the game, so you really can't miss anything from sitting anywhere here.

This place also has Chicago deep dish pizza! I didn't want to eat super heavy that night tho so we went for the buffalo chicken sliders and steak fries. Our waiter was pretty awesome. I wish I caught his name, but he made sure we were taken care of.

We are definitely coming back here tomorrow to watch Game 3."	5	Brando's Sportsbar	4
"Thank you Sushi Koma for putting me in food coma after my dinner.

AYCE fans come around - the deal at this joint is ~ $22\/lunch and $26\/dinner.  The seating here is very limited and the seating area is on the small side. I could literally reach over and pick up the food on my neighbor's plates IF I WANTED TO (just to give an idea on how small we're talking here).

Anyways.. They have a pretty good selection on their sushi. I'm pretty simple when it comes to sushi. I don't go for sashimi or nigri. I wish they gave more edamame in one serving. If you're a fan of baked\/deep fried rolls PLEASE TRY THEIR VOLCANO ROLL. I liked their Pania Roll as well, but too much cream cheese for my liking =( My ONLY downfall is that their servers kept getting multiple orders missed up. They delivered our edamame to the table next to us along with our volcano roll. 

I just wished this place was bigger - that would make all the difference. All in all, I'll be back whenever I get an AYCE sushi craving."	4	Sushi Koma	4

"When I actually do have the funds to splurge on a healthy meal, I choose this place.

They have a pretty healthy and diverse menu, so I'm sure you'll find something to meet your cravings. My go-to option is the Create Your Own Meal. This allows you to choose one protein, one green, one grain, and one dressing. Let your imagination run wild here. This is the perfect opportunity to meet that delicious, healthy craving you've been having.

My favorite selections for the Create Your Own Meal is salmon, asparagus, brown rice, and the lemon citrus dressing. I'll have to force myself to try the other proteins one day, but I'm always craving for salmon whenever I eat here. There's a light crust on the salmon, but the inside cuts up perfectly! The brown rice is the perfect texture - squishy, but NOT watery. The asparagus is prepared just how I like it - not burnt, but thoroughly cooked.

I really wish I had the funds to eat here everyday, but it can get pricey. This place is the perfect solution to eat healthy when you're too lazy to to make your own meal, but have the currency to splurge a little."	5	Greens and Proteins	4
"I've been here previously times and I'm not that big of a fan. I don't like karaoke for one thing, but that's besides the point.

The room we were in had really bad feedback on the mic. It kept interfering and causing that awful ""buzz"" noise. Plus the location of the machine was just above when you see what numbers you entered so you either have to have good eye sight OR you have to get up close to make sure you entered the right number.

The songs itself are pretty updated. You can even request for a Spanish book as well. They have a menu for ordering drinks and saw they had a promotion on their alcohol so follow up with that if you're interested. They don't allow outside foods or drinks.

If you check in through Yelp you will get a free sake bottle. Just show one of the workers and they will follow up with ID checking. The only problem with that coupon is it is misleading. It says PER PERSON not per party so after I redeemed mine I told my friend to do it as well. She had shown the worker and had already clicked on redeemed. The worker said they allow one per party because if everyone redeemed it we would have 20 free bottles of sake. He later added on that they were meaning to change that coupon, but will honor it for now since she already redeemed it.

All in all, this place isn't bad to go if you don't mind singing your hearts out while getting drunk."	3	Karaoke Q Studio	4.5
"I can't put my finger on what attracts me to this place. It might be its size - small and quaint, which gives off a very ""homey"" feeling. I can't forget the fact that it resembles a home with its white picket fence in front. It could be their delicious foods and drinks menu because what else would attract you to a place? Or maybe the weird, creep Disney-like decor! Perhaps its all the above combined!

This restaurant is located right down Fremont St, across from The Griffin and on the same side where Vanguard is. It can get pretty loud depending on the time you go, so if you're planning on going with friends to have some good conversation - I suggest you go on a weekday. Unless you want to be stared down by strangers and have to yell over the table, then by all means.. Come here on a weekend night.

They have a small menu, but it works! We went here with some friends so we were recommended items prior to even coming here. We started off their Chicken Wings (1 lb) and asked for the sauce on the size. These were delicious, but then again.. I've never came across a bad serving of Chicken Wings. Our main course consisted of sharing a Philly Mac and Cheese Steak (it is definitely share-worthy) alongside Garbage Fries. The meal was more than satisfying, but can I just rave for a second on their Garbage Fries?! I know it doesn't sound appealing, but their Garbage Fries consist of everything GARBA-licious smacked right on top of fries. I mean... cheddar and provolone cheese, bacon, jalapeños, green onions, tomatoes, peppers, avocados, and an egg! I probably will never not order their Garbage Fries when coming here. I feel like it would be a disservice to all things related to fries and I would be dishonoring a Fry God (if there is one). We complimented our food with 2 rounds of beer.

All in all, I left part of my stomach here at The Park... Meaning I will be back!"	4	Park on Fremont	4
"Hands down my favorite place to eat cajun shrimp.

I know it has competitors such as Hot n' Juicy and Cravin' Cajun, but this place takes it for me. Its very spacious with a lot of seating that includes tables and booths. They have tvs everywhere which is good especially during sports season. 

The food is amazing! Well, the shrimp is anyway. I've only had the King crab here once, but me and my boyfriend soon realized we can get crab other places and have stuck with getting shrimp from there on out. We always get the whole sha-bang (mild on mine). I find the medium a little too spicy for my liking. You also have to get the cajun fries. The meal just isn't complete without the fries. Don't forget salt\/pepper with lime! It takes the shrimp to a whole other level.

I love this place and will continue coming back time and time again."	5	The Boiling Crab	4
"I've never heard of this place prior to this past Friday night. We were invited to celebrate a 21st birthday so off we went to meet everyone here.

This place has been compared to New York style pizza which I can't really comment on since I've never had it. What I can say is that this place is definitely a fun experience. When you walk in, you're greeted with the pizza bar where you can watch your pizza getting made. You can ask to get seated or seat yourself at the bar. They have this really great deal on late night happy hour after 10pm which is AMAZING. My boyfriend and I ordered truffle fries, some Molinari pizza, and I ordered a coconut drink that resembled a mojito ~ relish.

We sat ran in front of the big screen at the bar which plays music videos and in between features scenes from various movies. The place is very chill and I see myself coming back for dinner whenever I'm craving pizza and I'm in the downtown area."	5	Pizza Rock	4
"We were originally shooting for Tofu Hut, but since the Golden Warriors won the NBA Finals... We decided to celebrate in honor of Steph Curry and get some curry (get it?)

My boyfriend has been to this place once before so he pretty much knew right off the bat what he wanted. I stuck to what I knew which was chicken katsu. They have a spice level scale on the bottom right hand of their menu. I can handle a little heat, but not too much - with that being said, I went with a level 3.

I can not be more thankful that I did. A level 3 was just perfect for me and my ""heat"" palate. It gave my meal a good kick without causing a waterfall dispensing from my nose. I do have to add though that a level 3 here is a lot more spicier than a level 3 in most Thai restaurants that I've ate at. In addition to our meals, we ordered tako yaki. It's good for what it is (octopus balls), but I probably wouldn't order it again since I'm not really a fan of octopus.

If you're a fan of curry, consider this place. It's small, quaint, and the chefs pack a hell of a punch when it comes to spices in your meals."	5	Japanese Curry Zen	4.5
"Nothing really sticks out about this place other than the small environment.

The sushi itself is alright with AYCE sushi being $25 for dinner. The menu, in my opinion, is mediocre. It's all your basic sushi that you can get anywhere. If you're going with a big group, be sure to call and make a reservation. If you have enough people they maybe able to place your party in their private room.

I guess if you're near Chinatown and can't decide on what sushi restaurant to eat at you can give this place a try."	3	Sushi Kaya	3.5
"Cheap, easy way to go for a buffet.

It's located in what I call the ""heart of the east side"" where China Olive use to be at. It's pretty small compared to other Buffet @ Asia restaurants, but the building itself was already pretty small.

Anyways.. Expect a wait. Not too long of a wait though. They're pretty quick on getting people in and out.

The food itself is your standard Chinese food. If you go during dinner, they have a selection on crab which is my favorite! I don't come here with high expectations, so I'm pretty well satisfied at the end of my meal. Their sushi is actually pretty decent as well.

Great place to go if you're on the east side and want some Chinese food."	3	Buffet Asia	3
"The sushi itself was pretty decent - nothing too extravagant. 

I went here with 4 girlfriends for happy hour which the pricing was great, but the number of rolls was disappointing. The main reason why I rated this place a 2 is the service.

We asked if the rolls could be given together based on who ordered what. The server stated she was giving them to us on which ones came out first to avoid having us wait for our food, but I mean.. if we requested them to be served that way why not cater to your customers request? In any case, we ended up having to fish around other dishes to put our own orders together.

As we were paying, the same server was arguing with one of my girlfriends about an order being served, but my friend did not receive the order.

Overall.. The sushi was average. The service - well, I've experienced better."	2	Hokaido Sushi	4
"I'm not sure why this place has so many bad reviews, but I will continue with mine.

I came here on a Saturday night after a friend's dinner - my other friend invited me for half off drinks. It's located right above Yard House near the Rave Theaters which helps with parking if you parked near H&M. Anyways, the music here is a mix of everything! I love variety. The happy hour menu was alright, but disappointed me because my favorite drink, AMF, was not on the menu. The crowd here is aimed towards the young crowd, but that's fine with me. The dance floor is pretty much wherever you make it and you can even play beer pong. They have an outside patio which allows for more conversation amongst people.

All in all, I will definitely be back here."	4	McFadden's Restaurant and Saloon	2
"So between AppleBee's, TGIFridays, and Chili's.. Chili's takes the ball with this one.

They added a Margarita Meal Deal for $35 which consists of their regular dinner for 2 options, but now they've added on margaritas! They give you the option to upgrade to their presidente margarita which I suggest you do because it is uh-maz-ing. 

The main reason why me and my boyfriend love Chili's is primarily for their texas cheese fries. The combination of fries, cheese, bacon bits, and jalapeños that makes our mouth salivate. As for my entree, I almost always opt for their chicken cajun pasta.  This meal deal also includes strawberry cheese cake which speaks for itself so need I say more?

All in all, I would definitely choose Chili's over AppleBee's and TGIFridays anyway."	4	Chili's	3
"If you're trying to figure out what to do on a Friday, Saturday, or heck even a Thursday night - pull through here.

Yes, you weren't confused. Even on a THURSDAY night this place can draw in quite the crowd.

I'm still kind of confused on the 3-star rating because this place deserves nothing, but 5 stars. I brought my friend from San Diego (who use to live in Vegas) and she was pretty blown away at this place. She didn't know there were bars like this outside of the downtown area. The best way for me to describe this place is that it's very similar to Gold Spike without having to deal with downtown traffic. It looks like a decked out back yard party that someone decided to throw while the parents are out of town.

Anyways, they've got the outdoor area with picnic tables for playing beer pong, heater lamps (for those cold winter-y nights), corn hole boards, ping pong tablets, a dj, and a bar. Inside they have even MORE seating, a few arcade games, another bar, and a mini bowling alley. I also believe that's some darts in the far end of the room you can play.

I've gone here several times and will continue coming back several more times. I've always had awesome service and some unforgettable nights here. If you're in town for St. Patrick's Day or Cinco de Mayo, this place really knows how to celebrate those holidays.

I also have to praise this bar for having my favorite gin, Hendrick's. So do me a favor and drink a gin & tonic for me."	5	PKWY Tavern	3
"I'm an avid lover for Boiling Crab, but when that place gets too crowded Hot n' Juicy comes in second for me.

Personally, I'm a shrimp lover. I love a little spice to my food, but not too much where my nose is running. With that said, I get the shrimp with the Hot n' Juicy season mild. No surprise here that I have to order a side of cajun fries. I feel like you can't go to these types of restaurant and NOT order a side of cajun fries.

The only difference with the sauce is that this one seems a tad bit sweeter than Boiling Crab. I'm still a lover either way =) This place also has a bigger selection on beer.

So if you're into cajun food, but want to drink tons of beer as well - this place takes it over Boiling Crab. Although both places are good and you can't go wrong with either."	4	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
"How have I NOT written a review about this place yet?

I'm here at least once a week. When you pair up good food with even better prices - how am I not here even more?!

The AYCE KBBQ prices for both lunch and dinner beat the rest. I mean $13.99 between 10:00pm to closing and then $16.99 any other time. You can't compete with that. 

You. Just. Can't.

Their appetizers will prepare your mouth for the glorious meat you'll eat. My favorite is the Korean pancake and tofu. Their house salad is also amazing. I have contemplated endless times to see if I could do a pick-up order on just their salad alone.

As for their meats, my favorite would be the good o'fashion pork belly. The brisket follows and then maybe the marinated pork belly. If you're extremely hungry, go ahead and order their steamed egg. It's a perfect combo with the rice.

The only reason why this place is 1 star away from a perfect 5 is their size. I really wish it was bigger! Half of the restaurant is divided so it can be a long gruesome wait if you come at the wrong time."	4	Tofu Hut	3.5
"Let me start off this review by saying prior to a month ago, I HARDLY (if ever) went to Dairy Queen. My sister use to work at one and I went to the one location in Henderson once.

Dairy Queen really needs to advertise and push out their $5 lunch menu. I discovered it through a coworker who would occasionally decide to have lunch here. For $5, yes 5 buckaroos, you get to choose between a chicken wrap, a cheeseburger, chicken tenders, and a chili cheese dog. All these meals include french fries and a sundae of your choice (caramel, chocolate, or strawberry), and all of them come with a drink. This is ALL for $5. My mind is still blown at how much of a deal this really is.

The location I go to has a drive-thru, which I believe most places do as well nowadays. I come here during my lunch break and get my meal within 10 minutes for the most part. I really can't go wrong when choosing this place.

P.S. They have this fry sauce and that is pretty bomb.com, if I do say so myself."	4	Dairy Queen	2
"If you've seen that viral Facebook video of that sushi burger, then you know you can get it here.

It's very similar to a sushi burrito. The ""patties"" are made of rice. I suggest getting the Panko crust for that extra crunch.

The sushi burger, called Jjanga Burger, consists of spicy tuna, crab meat, and seaweed salad. It's wrapped in a brown paper to help keep its shape. You can get the burger alone for $9 or get the combo for $13. The combo will get you the burger, fries, and a drink. I'm a fries girl, so I ALWAYS go for the combo. My fiancé on the other hand says he can pass on the fries

I deducted a star because the first time I had this, my fiancé picked it up to go and he was carrying 4 small size clear cups. He said that they don't have any other size cups so they gave him 2 of each to equal a medium size. Wouldn't it be easier to invest in bigger size cups?

Other than that, I've already been back 3 times. I love ordering it to go. I work 5 minutes away and it only takes 15-20 minutes to prep."	4	Jjanga Steak & Sushi	4.5
"I still can't believe I went to Makino's the first time ever back in September and I just recently went back on Black Friday.

The first time I came here, I honestly had NO idea what Makino's was. The only buffets I have ever been to are usually the ones that serve a while assortment of food, but this primarily focuses on Japanese food. So you can only imagine my excitement when I first walked in and saw the incredible display of sushi, especially my favorite: salmon nigiri. If you go at dinner, you can catch their crab legs, however, the quality of them is mediocre at best.

Besides sushi, Makino's has yakisoba, chicken teriyaki, ramen, miso soup, salad, mussels, shrimp tempura and more. Their dessert selection is okay. They do have a chocolate fondue foundation, so if chocolate is your thing then knock yourself out. Their cream puffs are okay, but I feel like they could be a TAD bit sweeter. That's a lot for me to say because I don't really like sweets that much. I do love their green tea ice cream. I feel like you can't go wrong with green tea ice cream.

All in all, I'm not that big a fan on buffets anymore. However, if I am being treated out or treating someone else out that loves buffets. This is by far the cheapest (yet better quality) option even if you go for their dinner menu because you get crab legs. If you're looking for good quality crab legs, then you might want to look somewhere else."	3	Makino Sushi & Seafood Buffet	3.5
"So upon moving into the south west side of Vegas, the only Hawaiian restaurant I knew about was Island Flavor. It wasn't until one Sunday afternoon that my boyfriend came home with food from here and we haven't been back at Island Flavor since. Don't get me wrong though! I love Island Flavor, but Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is in walking distance from my house.

Their BBQ mixed plate is delicious - it's my usual go to order if I'm not wanting anything else. Their chicken katsu is amazing along with their kalua pig. Some people aren't a fan of macaroni salad. I, on the other hand, LOVE MACARONI SALAD. The one from here I on point.

I get really iffy when ordering boba from a non-Asian place so I was skeptical when ordering a Thai tea from here... BUT! I was proven wrong. The Thai tea here is just as good as any other boba place which makes me extremely happy because now I am just walking distance away from fulfilling my Thai tea craving.

BIG TIP: Order ahead of time if possible. The wait here can be very long if you come at the wrong time. I was ordering dinner here for myself around 9 o'clock on a Tuesday night and ended up waiting at least 25 minutes. 

Did I mention how small it is? You add on the possible long waiting time and crowded area. You'll probably be eating your meal with a stranger waiting for their order RIGHT next to you."	5	Ohana Hawaiian BBQ	4
"Atlas my favorite sushi place in Las Vegas!

Unfortunately I'm unable to rate them a full 5 star due to their slowness on delivering plates. My group definitely has to order a lot of sushi at once to compensate for the wait time in between orders.

The environment is amazing. It's definitely the most up to date sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. I'm judging by the actual wall decor to the house music played.

My favorite dish would have to be A Lobster Affair. If you don't have a shellfish allergy give this dish a try."	4	Oyshi Sushi	3.5
"Shout out to the Asian girls. Let the lights dim sum.""

If you got a fancy for Chinese food and are extremely hungry definitely check this spot out.

I don't really have high expectations for Chinese restaurants so this one is no exception. I've ate here twice and left both times with a belly full of food.

I was never a fan of duck, but became one because of this place. I also need to add my love for shumai. If you don't have high expectations of a restaurant just give this place a shot."	4	Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant	3.5
"If you're going to eat here, avoid the Double Crunch Shrimp off their 2 for $24 deal. The double crunch really is DOUBLE CRUNCH. They definitely over did the frying on the shrimp along with the fries. Even my boyfriend, who is a avid foodie and is pretty much easily content with any meal, found distaste in his shrimp.

I ordered the Bourbon Street Steak as I've ordered it many times before at different Applebees restaurants and this time around.. It tasted a little too bland for my liking. I was quite disappointed since I really do enjoy this dish.

Our waitress was okay, but was very awkward when we told her it was our friend's birthday and asked if they did anything special. She said that can give a free dessert in which I agreed to. The dessert came towards the end of the meal, of course, but she was so awkward in delivering it. It was just her and she kind of tried to ""sneak it"" on the table. There was no happy birthday song from her or the staff so me and my friends kind of had to take over from there. I'm sure its different for a kid's birthday though - I mean, my friend turned 23 so I guess they don't find the need to sing happy birthday at that age,

All in all, this place falls a little below ""alright"" for me. I've had better experiences at other Applebees. I probably won't be back here anytime soon or in the near future."	2	Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar	3
"SkinnyFats you have won me over!

I thought I had an idea of what to expect through all the reviews, but even then I was still so surprised! This place does not seem like it belongs in Las Vegas, but maybe somewhere in California. It's almost like a restaurant inspired by Tumblr\/Pinterest with all the colors, art, and overall interior decor. I had slight difficulty finding the place since it's located in somewhat of a office plaza. Good thing they have signs on the light poles stating, ""SKINNY FATS - YOU JUST MISSED US.""

Anyways.. Me and my friend went during lunch time and all I got to say is that if you're planning on going here - TRY TO AVOID LUNCH TIME. This tiny place was packed! Luckily, they have somewhat speedy service and we were able to place our order. I opted for a healthy snack and a happy side which was the mini Gobbler and truffle fries. The mini Gobbler is basically a slider burger which upon appearance I thought I should have ordered more because there was no way this small burger and bowl of fries what going to fill me up.. Surprise! Surprise! I ended my meal with a full stomach and I didn't feel totally gross. I've never had a turkey burger and found this one to be very appetizing. I definitely did not feel guilty eating it and found my hunger satisfied.

I want to make a trip back here and indulge on a happy entree. This place matched up to my expectations and more. I left giving it a 2 thumbs up along with a 5-star rating."	5	SkinnyFATS	4.5
"I have found the perfect pho restaurant to meet my craving during my lunch break!

It's located a mere 5 minutes from my work, which makes it perfect! This is by far one of the cleanest pho restaurants I've been to next to Side Street Pho & Grill. They have half of the restaurant divided with booths and the other half divided with tables. If you have a larger party, search for seating towards the back.

The service here is on point. They're quick, friendly, and efficient. I usually eat here right when they open (11am), but I did come here once at 12pm and the service was still up to par. They'll let you choose your seating and set you up with appropriate utensils. I love that their soup spoons have the ""hook"" so it doesn't fall into your broth\/soup.

I order the rare steak or the rare steak with brisket - both are amazing. The broth here is perfection. I can't think of any other way to stress that enough. The only thing is that they don't have cilantro in their pho, but you can ask for some and they'll give you a small plate so you can add as much as your heart desires. The pricing for pho is average; ranging from $8-9 I believe.

I just love love love how their service is. I only get an hour break, so I'm in and out of here with time to spare. I'm becoming a regular here and I have no shame in that."	5	Pho Annie 2	4.5
"My boyfriend and I were recently introduced to this place by a couple of good friends and let's just say... I'm throwing up 5 stars!

My friend is a huge fan of tsukemen ramen (known as cold ramen). Now if you're not familiar with this... It's basically ramen noodles separated from the soup. You pick up your portion size of noodles and dip it into the soup. The noodles are a lot fatter, almost resembling pasta noodles and the soup is a lot more thick. 

*There aren't many ramen places that serve this on Vegas. She's a fan because she's from California and they serve this a lot there!*

The broth was delicious and the taste was delightful. I don't know how else to explain it. You have to go and try it for yourself. I will advise tho that even I had to trade out my chopsticks for a fork because my noodles kept slipping.

Let me add that this place doesn't get overly packed! It's a consistent flow of business, but I'm sure you won't find yourself waiting to be seated."	5	Ramen Tatsu	4.5
"I've gone here a couple times and the food is alright. Just don't compare it to the multiple buffets we have in the fancy casinos on the Strip.

Any buffet with crab legs is a winner in my book, but for some reason the crab legs here were a little skimpy on the meat =( I shouldn't work so hard to crack open a leg to find NO MEAT inside. 

Anyways.. They offer other variety of foods here from sushi to french fries and wonton soup. They serve fruits here along with ice cream, but I did find the ice cream to taste a bit strange.

If you enjoy Buffet @ Asia then you'll probably like this place as well since they both are pretty much tied in my book."	3	Krazy Buffet	3.5
"What's better than learning how to paint? Getting served wine and food in the process!

I am such a big fan of this whole concept. You get to buy admission to a painting you want to learn how to do and while learning you get to sip on wine and munch down on appetizers, entrees, and desserts. 

I received my first ever Design & Wine admission as a gift from my best friend. The actual class started at 6:30, but we arrived at 6:00 thinking it was going to be packed and that all the good seats were going to be taken. Fortunately, it was pretty much empty and we were able to get good seats and reserve some as well. After checking you in, they give you a sheet in which you place your orders. They have appetizers (not too fond of croissants), along with entrees (sandwiches mainly), and desserts. My eyes trailed to the alcohol section and of course me and my girls had to get their moscato. It's super sweet! The instructor even offered a happy hour deal towards the end of class causing us to get another glass of their moscato ;)

The painting lesson itself is pretty easy. They walk you through everything and even lend a hand when needed. They go over the different brushes and what to do if paint is running on your canvas or if you need to change your paint water.

You can go on their website and choose what painting you want to learn and even reserve certain dates for special events. It was my first time going, but will definitely not be my last.

PS: definitely look into their date nights. You and your significant other (or best friend) can work together and paint a big canvas. The painting is usually something long that will take up 2 canvases. One paints the left canvas and the other the right - when put together it becomes one picture."	5	Design & Dine	4.5
"I went here a couple months back and I've got to say they really need to improve their customer service.

Me and my boyfriend wanted to grab a quick bite before heading out with our friends. I really was craving some shaved iced so Icy Juicy it was. Upon entering the restaurant, there wasn't enough tables. We stood waiting for about 10 minutes or so and when we finally got seated they didn't have enough menus. The waitress told us we would have to wait since a bigger party came in and took all the menus. After the huge party was done ordering, the waitress gathered the menus and didn't even remember to give us one. I had to remind her! Afterwards, we placed our order. We waited what seemed like 20-30 minutes. When we finally got our order (we ordered an actual dish as well), the waitress and waiter were confused. They couldn't remember WHO ordered that dish. I watched across the restaurant as the waiter questioned the waitress. I waited about 3 minutes to finally confirm that the mystery-ordered dish was mine and my boyfriend's. 

Overall the wait for this place is horrible! They really need someone who speaks English."	2	Icy Juicy	3
"The Crepe Shack Gods have heard my prayers! They finally decided to open up a new location on the West side of Las Vegas. No more traveling far and wide to Henderson for some good quality crepes!

This location is sort of tucked away. It's fairly new so I don't recall seeing it on a plaza board. It's near Hobby Lobby, but tucked away in the same lot as a Curry Leaf and Good Fella. *I had to drive around the lot for a few minutes trying to locate it myself.

Now, the space is a LOT smaller than the Henderson location. It's not nearly as modern and they don't have a selection of game boards available (not yet anyway), but the menu is the same. It's plastered on a big black board behind them, but there's also menus on pamphlets if you prefer those.

I went with my go-to order which is the Rebel Special. I switched it up this time and got chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla. *I'm such a dare devil, I know!* Same great taste, just a different location is all that I can say.

People might be disappointed in the lack of size this place offers, but.. I'm going for what really matters - the crepes. I'm sure in time this place will become up to date just like the Henderson location. Until then... Just enjoy their amazing crepes.

I'll be back for sure."	5	Crepe Shack	4.5
"Me and a group of friends ended up here for dinner due to the wait at Tofu Hut being extremely long and we were on a time schedule.

This restaurant definitely beats Tofu Hut in size - hands down! You could probably fit twice the many people here which is a good thing. The grill is kind of small, in my opinion, but I just maybe use to the grill at Tofu Hut.

Anyways, just like the previous reviews... This Korean BBQ place is a buffet style. Be prepared to be on your feet to serve yourself rice, meat, sauce, etc. Its great in the sense you can control how much you get served, but a hassle to keep getting up. I do have to add I was not impressed with their pork belly cuts. It was just way too thick for my liking. I did enjoy their kalbi pork and brisket. 

In the end, I probably won't be back here unless I absolutely need to. It's pretty pricey for the experience and honestly, I like sitting back and being served. If I wanted to go to a self-serving buffet then I would."	3	Sura BBQ Buffet	3.5
"There's an important saying: ""You can't buy happiness, but you can buy pizza... which is kind of the same thing.""

Unfortunately for this place, it did not live up to that ""pizza happiness.""

If you've ever been to Pieology, it's very similar. If you've never been to Pieology, then it's very similar to how Chipotle runs.. and if you've never been to Chipotle... well then I don't know what to tell you.

Anyways, you have basically 3 options from the menu. You can: 1) make your own with unlimited toppings 2) select a cheese pizza or 3) choose one of their pre-selected pizzas.

I went with my fiancé and of course we chose the unlimited toppings! I don't eat any pork, so I chose chicken as my meat. I lathered on Alfredo sauce and covered that bad boy in a bunch of veggies. The 'za didn't take long to bake, but I was fairly disappointed. I wanted all my toppings to be melted in and the mushrooms were that over cooked, squishy texture that I love. We ordered a side salad, which to be honest... could have been it's own meal by itself (KUDOS for that!) but it was simple.

I do have to say I love the decor and that they have a little bar you can sit at. Oh! Did I forget to mention they serve beer? Who doesn't love beer and pizza?! (Unless you're under 21, then that's a no to you, you youngins!)

All in all, this place rated about average for us. It was delicious at the time, but I was starving. But I definitely won't be returning anytime soon. Throw me a $5 pizza from Lil Cesar's any day."	3	PizzaRev	3.5
"Las Vegas is seriously on the come up with island food. They don't refer to us as the 9th island for nothing.

Makai is located on Fort Apache, right across from Walmart and in the same plaza as Sweet Addiction.

It kind of reminds me of Chipotle in the sense where you get to choose what you want in your order. They have an assortment of sizes to select from that all vary in the base (white or brown rice), meat (chicken, steak, ahi poke, etc.) and a side if available. You can also choose to add on a side if you'd like. The ordering is pretty straight forward, so just go for what you'd like. If you decide on the poke, there's a regular one and a spicy. I opted for the spicy and it was delicious!

The restaurant itself actual resembles Chipotle too. It seriously is, just the Hawaiian version of it. The food is amazing and the staff was nice. There's a lot of seating inside, but if the weather permits.... Definitely choose to sit outside as there are seatings on the side.

Our first visit will definitely not be our last! This place had my boyfriend claiming it to be his favorite and I expect us to be visiting again shortly."	5	Makai Pacific Island Grill	4.5
"My craving for awesome poke has been fulfilled and I have THIS place to thank for it.

I've been on the search for some good quality poke. There use to be a poke market located on Warm Springs and Arroyo Grande, but closed down 1.5 years ago so since then.. I've been searching and searching and FINALLY have tried this place.

They have a good range of different pokes which you can find on their website. I got 1\/4 pound of their shoyu poke, 1\/2 furikake poke, and 1\/2 spicy tuna equaling out to be $24 (roughly). I can say that I am a fan of their furikake and spicy tuna. There's just so much flavor that my mouth is watering at the mere thought. The shoyu poke was good, don't get me wrong, but next to the furikake and spicy tuna (both pack a good punch of flavors) - this wasn't my favorite out of the 3. 

I will definitely be back to order more in the future. It's a piece of Hawaii in a small plastic container.

Tip: Call ahead of time to place your order. I'm not sure if their supply runs out, but better save than sorry."	5	Poke Express	4.5
Is a small restaurant food is good! Also the owners are very friendly they make sure u are satisfied!	5	Mi Pueblo Taco Shop	4.5
"Horrible food. Horrible customer service. Ordered a wrap with NO CHEESE for my daughter. She has a dairy allergy which  I clearly stated when ordering.
Had my daughter check the wrap while we were still in the restaurant even though we were carrying out.
HAD CHEESE in it so I told the girl at the register who took my order. She yelled back to the girl making the wrap  "" I said it has NO CHEESE"". So we waited again while the same girl remade the wrap.
She gave it to me and apologized. I told her no worries..and left. BIG MISTAKE. 
Got home, still had pieces throughout...and the tortilla had the same MELTED CHEESE from before.
SHE REUSED THE TORTILLA AND JUST PICKED OUT THE BIG PIECES OF CHEESE. 
We threw it away. I just wasted $8. 
IM JUST GLAD MY KID DID NOT EAT IT AND HAVE A SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION.
Plenty of other restaurants who care about the quality of food, staff and customer service. Won't be back."	1	Tropical Smoothie Cafe	2.5
I've wanted to stop in for a few weeks now so today was the day and I was not disappointed! Very friendly and helpful staff, fun eating area, but above all amazing food! I went with what they said was a top seller, the skinny dip (#2). Great mix between Philly cheesesteak and French dip. Very flavorful, and fresh! Only bad thing was it went down way to fast! It was that good. Looking for a new place to eat with great subs, upbeat atmosphere, and friendly staff, give these guys a go! You won't be disappointed. Excited to come back next time for breakfast	5	7 Sinful Subs	4.5
"We came by today which is a Friday so I had the baby back special. My wife and friend both got the BBQ chicken. Far as the meats, my ribs were good but not $15 good and they both felt the portion on the chicken was lacking, along the anything special on taste for the price. The sides were small too. Use to normally getting loaded at BBQ joints with sides or at least bread but here not the case. Only drink options are in a fridge or lemonade\/tea is prepared. Have to say, if you do go by, have to try their banana pudding! Now that was delish! Overall for Spending $50 for 3 people to eat, I'm disappointed. Had high hopes for this place based on help reviews but maybe we came on an off day or time. 
Also, not family friendly at all. Well those with small children. I have a almost two year old, yet no high chairs were seen nor ever offered so it forced my wife to have to hang onto him. Active little boy! Also no changing tables in bathroom. All in all, try it out for yourself. I've had better for less\/more but probably not the worse spot I've ate BBQ at lol"	2	Sin City Smokers Barbecue and Catering	4.5
"Found this place on YELP. Very fun menu which made it hard to decide what to eat, so got creative. Wanted a breakfast burrito but also an omelette so couldn't decide then realized they had me covered...you can turn any omelette into a burrito!! Got the hangover cure omelette, as a burrito. Was amazing! Also ordered the aunt Maggie stuffed French toast, which was also spot on and very satisfying! 
Definitely will be back to try more of the extensive menu!"	5	Squeeze In	4
After waiting in line for 45 mins and paying over $75 for my wife and myself I was hoping to be impressed... Well I was not. This Buffet was average at best. I expected the food to be served hot but most of it was warm to room temperature. Ate almost my whole meal without a drink refill. Had to ask the waiter twice before we finally got them filled up but by then we were pretty much done eating. My first piece of prime rib was very good and juicy, went back but second piece was dry. Some things were good but nothing stood out as great. Other Vegas buffets are cheaper and better. Don't think I will be back..	3	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
I am so disappointed after coming to Hakkasan. Warning anyone who comes to hakkasan, there is a theft ring who goes around stealing phones and wallets out of girls' purses while they are holding them on the dance floor. Protect yourself! Hakkasan Las Vegas Nightclub should be working towards helping prevent the problem. I understand that there's not much they can do but at least they should be producing a disclaimer about the unbelievable amount of theft that is going on in their nightclub and possibly step up security! Two girls in our group got their phones and credit cards stolen and we were just two of many! be careful!!! such a disappointing end to the trip. And very disappointing the management doesn't do a thing to prevent this.	1	Hakkasan Nightclub	2.5
"This place is really clean. It is in China Town, so it is a bit far away from the Stripe. 
The taste of the food doesn't have many surprising elemen. I personally don't like those crazy Asian fusion restaurants in hotels, so this place works for me. 
Sashimi are fresh; they don't really have toros.
Cubed grilled beef is very tender. The mushrooms in this dish has a sourness that neutralize the fattiness of the beef.
Tempuras are of decent size, but the flour coat is not very light and airy.
Sushi rolls are fine. Dashi stocks has very subtle flavors, and the chicken in dashi stock brings of the flavor of the soup. 
Grilled mackerel is average. 
The price in this place is very reasonable. It tookless than 100 dollars to fully stuff five people."	5	Yu-Yu	4.5
When you go to this place, you should definitely try the poached lobster tail. It is poached perfectly, so the center of the lobster meat is super tender with a bit chewiness, kind like those ebi sashimi in a Japanese restaurant. The lemon butter sauce brings out the lobster flavor with just the right amount of sourness.	5	Joes Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab	4.5
"The food here is great! I also liked the atmosphere! And the staff is very helpful. We were late about half an hour due to a traffic accident on the Strip but we were seated fast.
We had a Groupon for a 7 course meal for 2 and it was worth every penny and more! We also tried some cocktails which were delicious.
You should definitely try this place."	5	Koi Restaurant	3.5
Great service and amazing food. Extremely affordable. I have gone here more times than I should admit since I've started working next door to them. I would recommend this place to family and friends.	5	Maui Rose Hawaiian BBQ	4
This place is great for breakfast! Chicken fried steak was perfect, service was prompt and friendly and the prices were reasonable. You can't go wrong with the $3 bloody mary's either!	5	Our Families Country Cafe	4
And they are lucky to get one star! I ordered a Chicago style dog, it came with grilled onions and grilled peppers. OK, well I guess they have never been to Chicago! Well I guess I'll roll with it, so I went back up and asked if I could get a little sauerkraut. The guy said sure and started to reach for it when the super friendly female worker (sarcasm) said, "no that makes it an $8 hot dog!" seriously, for 10 cents of sauerkraut? I said "well this really isn't a Chicago dog"  she said "too bad, it's what you asked for" really? At this point I just asked for my $7 back which she was more than happy to give. Advice to this Roach Coach... If you are going to sell something called a Chicago dog wiki it at least, second if someone wants 10 cents of a hot dog topping on a $7 hot dog, it's FREE.	1	Sausagefest Food Truck	3.5
This was my second time eating here and I had to yelp it. First the service is genuinely warm and welcoming, like you're part of the family. You're greeted right away usually by the owner Frank himself. You can tell he takes pride in his restaurant and it really shows in the food. Amazing mexican food! This time around I had the Chile Verde burrito. The pork was tender and flavor packed. Not greasy or fatty like at some places, just the perfect balance. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for some great authentic mexican cooking! Also they are now open on Saturday's.	5	Phat Phrank's	4

"This place is straight fire. Everything about it was awesome. The tacos were a little pricey but that is expected when your getting something so savory. The ambience reminded me of south central LA, old school taqueria... I got adobo and carne asada. They also give you some roasted chiles that are awesome. I wish they would give u some chips but it's whatever's. Oh ya the salsa on the tacos is so bomb. Overall straight 5 stars, wish I could've gave it
More."	5	Tacos El Gordo	4.5
I love this place- y is everyone trippin- good as pizza, not bad price and the service is ait. Id recommend to a family member for sure.	5	Brothers Italian Bistro	2.5
Great stuff!! I'm at work and the pizza guy was professional enough. The pizza itself was bomb, the little garlic bread is outstanding and even the marinera sauce was on point. I bought a large pizza and it fed 4 adults, average size adults I should say. But man this is like the 3rd time I order here and it's the beezneez.	5	Angelina's Pizzeria	2.5
This place was amazing top-of-the-line service food and atmosphere.

I loved it, perfect date night.	5	Marché Bacchus	3.5
The place was a mess from beginning to end, plates on almost every table that was not being used. The host and waiter lacked attending. The food was ok. I gave this place a second try and i waited 1 hour. Never will i go back again	1	Las Pupusas	3.5
Unbelievable food. Just tell them your price range per person, any allergies or foods to generally avoid, and they'll custom tailor an entire menu for you. It's pretty pricey, but some of the best food I've had in my many trips to LV. If your budget allows for it, definitely get the Kobe beef with the hot rock to cook it on. It's like a religious experience.	4	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
If you're looking for some solid Thai food, this is a place to be.  It definitely appeals to the American palate. Their food is a great introduction for those looking for something different and savory.	4	Archi's Thai Cafe	3.5
Love their yummy donut holes, PB&J and Smores.  Yumm!  Since it is "Sin City Snoballs",  you must have a snow drink with the ice cream treat in the middle, "Titos Hawaiian" is pretty tasty on a hot day!  Try their Belgium Cocoa, so rich, but so good on a crisp evening.  Definitely can't be on a diet when you're visiting this food truck!  :)	4	Sin City Snoballs & Snacks	4.5
"Their appetizer prawns were the only thing memorable about this place.  It's been know to be the ""Best Thai Restaurant"" in Las Vegas.  I think that saying made their head too big and thought they were still king of the Thai cuisine.  

The service was very slow.  We were seated right away and someone brought water right away.  After 5min we had to wave someone down to order some drinks, then 10mins we had to waive again to order our food, from the hostess.  They weren't busy, just a few guys standing around, maybe bussers, but who knows.  Their appetizer prawns, that they're known for are great.  We ordered the usual safe stuff to compare, curry from their popular list and some noodle dish and they were both just ok.  

The 5 stars on his site are quite questionable.  I'm thinking, they've never ever had Thai food before.  They definitely need to work on their urgency of serving their customers, because their food, is just ok, not earth shattering. If you're new to the Thai cuisine, it's just fine."	3	Lotus of Siam	4
"Amazing view!

COVER: $30 according to the website, but I'm not sure what we paid, because the bride-to-be booked in advance.

DRINKS: Because we booked in advance, we had our own tables and alcohol served there. Along with ice water! There were plenty of glasses for our 12+ group. Nice.

AMBIANCE: Zen buddha lounge theme entering the lounge. Pretty empty inside room with bar and plenty of couch seating. Walking pass that we eventually made it outside to experience a fascinate view of the strip. It was not overly crowded. People looked relaxed and enjoying the night. It was rather warm though, being outside and all. Wish there were misting units. The crowd was lacking younger college undergrads, sluts, and creepy grinding-feel-you-up guys - it was more of the young professionals place. Your IQ might even go up here.

OTHER: The manager (or equivalent) was attentive enough to introduce our party to our waitress. 

MUSIC: Lots of Top 40 Hits (there was no way to escape ""Moves like Jagger"" in Vegas) and highlights from decades past. The volume was fine where we were.

VISIT DETAILS: Bachelorette party"	4	Foundation Room	4
Had an awesome bartender named Jason who went above and beyond for us. We had asked him to surprise us with a unique drink. He started asking us what we had liked and surprised us with a drink that was just spot on! If your looking for a bartender to give you something different than the usual, he's your guy!	5	Rx Boiler Room	4
"I found this place on Yelp when I was searching for healthy options to eat while I was in Vegas. I LOVED this place. I ate here for lunch twice during my 4-day trip. Definitely a small place, in a kind of hard-to-find location (take the guest room elevators up to the pool floor, it's right before you walk out to the pool area).

I tried the breakfast wrap, sonoran scramble, grilled ahi tuna sandwich, chicken satay, and a smoothie. I love how everything is fresh and organic...I could just taste the freshness! I could even tell that the salsa was made with fresh ingredients. I loved how the breakfast meals came with a small side of fresh fruits.

My favorites were the breakfast wrap (with organic eggs, veg, and sprouted whole wheat tortilla) and the open-faced ahi sandwich. My least favorite was the chicken satay. It was a bit dry and the flavoring wasn't as strong as I'd like. 

I was debating between a 4 or 5 star. 
5 stars because I feel like it's the most high quality AND only organic, healthy option there is ON the Strip. Not to mention that the food is yummy.
4 stars because the portions are a bit on the smaller size for the price. Although I left satisfied but not bloated, my hubby who loves to eat meat and large portions was still hungry."	4	Canyon Ranch Grill	4
Maybe it's Las Vegas and no expectation should be given to the Chinese food, but this place is really nothing more than normal as to the food quality. The only benefit you may get is the opportunity to have some traditional Chinese breakfast. They have a lot of choices, mainly from Taiwan and Tianjin. The staff were extremely inefficient and inattentive. We complained a few times about the speed of getting our food, but nobody cared and a boy waiter even coldly said "talk to whoever took your order" (although he clearly knew who took our order, he even did not tell that waitress who kept staying behind the counter when walked by). One star given to the choice of food, but would strongly advise this restaurant to get improved.	2	Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli	3.5
I would expect more in a popular buffet restaurant in a popular five-star hotel in this popular city. The cashier was very tough when we asked questions about the price. The waitress was OK, but slow in cleaning the table even though the place was not busy at all. And the food - nothing really worth mentioning. Just like a place to fill up your stomach but nothing more than that. I have to reveal the fact that they on purpose, in my opinion, put EXTREME salt into the crab legs making guests take less. On the day we were there, the first plate of crab legs were like normal and quickly taken away by the line of guests. Then there came the really salty ones dispelled the whole line as well as our appetite. Shame on such buffet restaurant! The breakfast, however, is on average so deserves another star.	2	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
I'm not a fan of country music but Yo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They got women doing bull riding in here. I guess I can stay for a little while.	2	Gilley's	3

"I must say I was surprised by Angara India Spice Grill tonight. I arrived around 8:15p and there was only 1 couple sitting in the restaurant. Unsure if I wanted take out or dine in, I took a few moments to browse the menu and look around. The restaurant lights were low, however it was clean and tidy with table dressings. So far so good, I'm thinking in my head. I finally decided to dine in, and in glad I did! Water was offered immediately, along with the flat bread and spices and menu. I must add that it did take roughly 5-7 mins. to be seated due to there only being 1 server doing it all...taking phone orders and servicing the dining area, but later turned into two servers. Let me fast forward, after ordering around 8:30p the food took 15-20 mins to prepare and was served nice and hot. I enjoyed the level 5 spice from 1-10, and it wasn't spicy at all. This could have been a plus because, I was able to enjoy the flavors and freshness of the chicken Tikka Masala & garlic naan breard with a side of rice. Yes, I had plenty of carbs tonight, and all for under $25.00 with a 20% tip ;-) If, you were to ask would I return, I'd have to say YES, with family and friends. BTW, portions are a nice size and can be shared by two easily!

Sorry pic is dark, my camera battery was giving out on me. Enjoy if you plan on going!"	4	Angara Indian Spice Grill	4.5
"I expected more from Pieology today, especially since the line was almost out the door.  I ordered the rustic veggie, but was asked if I wanted to customize my order? I was already on the fence regarding ordering the rustic, now I had more options. I ended up getting the following toppings (red sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, red onion mushrooms, artichokes, grape tomatoes, jalapeños, black olives, garlic spread on whole wheat crust). I ordered ""to go vs. dining in"" which was my 1st mistake & 2nd I think the toppings were too much for the thin crust, but I am also under the impression the cooking duration wasn't long enough.  

The concept here remindered me of an upgraded Papa Murphy's with an oven . To be fair the toppings were fresh, staff very courteous, location clean with cool life quotes on the wall. I'm willing to give this location another try sometime in the future. If you decide to eat here plan on dining in, the pizza doesn't hold heat well for a trip ride across town & is very messy if you plan on eating it in the car."	3	Pieology Pizzeria	3.5
Great food even better banda great staff any negative reviews are honestly sad pathetic excuses for not having a great time here i highly recommend bringing your friends and family here i had a blast	5	Culichi Town	3.5
How cool is that?  Walk down the line, order the crust, pick out the toppings, maybe order a salad or a small plate, and a drink and by the time you get to the cashier, your pizza is popping out of the pizza oven cooked perfectly and ready to devour! YUM! Clean modern decor, great service, convenient location and good eats...who could ask for anything more!	5	800 Degrees	3.5
Everything used to be better. Now this place defines itself as more....adequately edible. The ramen was good. The gyoza was shit and the pork belly was shameful today. I felt our server seemed a little put out to take care of my party of three. I can understand why. This place is always packed and there are no signs of slowing down. But I believe this business lost that feeling of appreciation for every guest that walks through the door. If I'm just a number then I will take the number 7.6. Because that is the exact number of miles it is to Ramen Fukumimi.	2	Monta Ramen	4
I agree with other reviewers quality vs price isn't there. Had the eggs Benedict wAs sub-par and & $14 bucks.had a side of bacon which was over cooked and dry.dont get caught up in the hype of this place. Lots of better places to go.	2	Sugar Factory American Brasserie	3
"Great food for the price 
Good service. 
Would have gave it 5 stars but we ordered the beef Wellington which they said the had and then they came back 15 min later saying they were sold out and quickly look for our decision on something else. 

All in all pretty decent for being on the heart of the strip and not being too much of a rip off 

The beef tartar and the duck confit were awesome."	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
This place advertises gluten free and vegan and I would bet a million bucks that it is no where close to meeting those requirements. We ordered the empanadas because they said GF. We even clarified with our waiter about the doughs ingredients. He went back to the kitchen twice to double check and said they were made out of corn. They came out and they were fluffy, flakey, buttery and delicious tasting, thus NOT at all GF. If you can eat anything without repercussion, this place will be fine for you. If you are targeting this place because of the Vegan or GF options, I would not trust there dedication to these dietary needs. BEWARE!	1	Makers & Finders Coffee	4.5
I just wasted a lot of time with these guys.  They don't deliver.  Yelp says that they do.  I told the first person I spoke with at the restaurant that I wanted to place a delivery order.  After going through everything, they then tell me that they do not deliver.  Get it together!	1	Shobu	4
Excellent food and service.  It has an AYCE option which worked well for me since I was starving @ the time.	5	Rock n Roll Sushi	3
Pretty good sushi. A wide variety of nigiri and rolls offered. Very good, attentive service. Only issues: the eel was not the freshest and the music was was eh...  I'll go back...	4	Sakana	4
I've got mixed feelings on this one. On one hand, we had outstanding service from Garrett.  Some of the best service ever.  On the other hand, some of the rolls didn't taste very fresh.  So 5 stars for service, 2 for the food.	3	Island Sushi and Grill Express	3.5
"My Girl and I gave this place a try being that we are Dim Sum aficionado's it was way better than we expected and reasonably priced too. They have all the same items from the other Dim Sum Spots so don't worry you'll be satisfied!
Compared to the other places we've tried I would give this place a must try! Coming from me I wouldn't say that to waste your time because everyone's taste buds are different so just try it out. Not only Dim Sum but they have a Regular Menu with Chinese Dishes as well. Spoke with one of the workers that used to work at a Dim Sum spot I would always go to and told him we'd definetly be back! I Guarantee you'll never say Nah when it comes to Yum Cha!"	4	Yum Cha	4
What can I say that hasn't been said before? This place just get's it! The food is obviously great, but it's the experience that I thrive on. I love the way that Dalton (DW) controls the dining room and sets the tempo. He walks through the restaurant like he's entertaining a dinner party at his home. The ability of table touching and making every guest feel like they are a part of a party is an art unto itself. The servers all know their s--t. As a fellow business owner, that is so indicative of a well oiled machine. And I see the same staff over and over which usually signifies great management. DW Bistro is doing Las Vegas proud by demonstrating how far the restaurant scene has come in suburban LV. Kudos!	5	DW Bistro	4.5
"I am an old school Vegas guy when it comes to service in this town. This place has only been open for a couple weeks and all I can say is wow! I've witnessed the owner and GM personally go to each customer to see how everything was going. I've seen this on ALL of the four times I have visited. The hardest things to convey to a service staff is to anticipate guests needs and recover from mistakes. They have obviously done a great job of that. Kudos!

I love the Cajun style fish and shrimp tacos. Really fresh on perfectly soft, corn tacos. BTW, their happy hour is pretty freakin awesome to take advantage on their indoor-outdoor patio. Way more of a bargain and laid back atmosphere than Kona Grill --in the same lot. I just hope the Lambo-driving, Affliction\/True Religion wearing-Summerlin douche bags- that scare away all the cute girls away, don't ruin my new favorite spot."	5	Wahoo's Fish Tacos	3.5
"Went in on Saturday afternoon. The first thing out of the counter guys ( taller dark longer hair hipster type) mouth was "" there's a reservation coming in and there will be no tables available. Also it's a 45 minute wait for takeout. "" Uhhh ""hello"" would have been nice. He seemed like he was trying to convince my party of 5 to leave. Uhhh ok peace out and great customer service training. 

I started going to the other spot on Arville before the Guy Fieri episode circa 2010. Humbler beginnings then.  If you guys have too much business I will be sure to tell everyone to spend their money elsewhere.  So rude."	1	Naked City Pizza On Paradise	3.5
My new favorite dessert spot in Chinatown LV. Been waiting anxiously for this location to open across the street. So excited when the open sign came on. They spent a ton of money decorating  and spared no detail. The bathroom is even amazing. Chose the Oreo Bingsoo and I'm addicted. Can't wait to try the other flavors. Staff was really friendly. Brush up on the social media and geo tagging guys. A lot of people will want to find this place and not get mixed up with other concepts that have "snow" in the name.	5	Snow White Cafe	4
"So many fucking haters on Yelp. If something comes in with a huge reputation, it seems like so many are eager to tear it down. When you review a spot, you should go with an open mind. Blank slate...like if you were the first one to review a new joint that nobody knows about. That's a true reviewer! 
With that being said, the shake shack in Dt summerlin was as good as I expected. Met with a friendly greet. Cashier asked if we needed recommendations. Place was clean and staff was eager to give the guest right-of-way and politely held open doors. Burgers were consistent to what I had in Madison Square Park. Strawberry shake was thick AF and tasty. Crinkle cut fries aren't my fav but good enough. Probably won't get cheese on them again-personal pref. 
How the hell can this be only a half star above Crave? This spot at least tries and should deserve at lowest 4 stars."	5	Shake Shack	3.5
This is the shittiest 5 star you will ever get. Almost every bartender is SUPER cool and energetic. This doesn't matter if you are playing or not. I play pretty hard but not last night. Employee 2016 Charles from my receipt (dark haired, shorter bartender) seems like a real jerk.  I kind of judge the bar how they treat you before dropping dime in the machines. He failed majorly. I hope this cavalier attitude isn't contagious. Because that would bring this place right back to Road Runner status. I am really hoping not, being a local patron from right down the street. Mr Fine are you reading your reviews?	5	PKWY Tavern	3
This spot is the epitome of "where everybody knows your name".  The owner Nick does such an amazing job of working the room and making everyone feel special. It's a lost art in this city. Almost forgot to mention the food. Nick went to culinary school so you know the food has to be on point... And it is. Personal favs are the Hangover Burger, salmon and butter mashed potatoes and fish and chips. Continued success people!!	5	The Pint	4
Came in late on my only day off about 9:30 pm. Didn't have much expectation, but this place delivered. The girls helping out were very friendly. I didn't know what to order, so I asked what was good. The "Smash Burger" she replied. Without even looking at the menu, I agreed to the recommendation. Wow. Egg? Are you seriously awesome? Fries were o.k. seasoned, but crispy non-the-less. The only thing I didn't like --which may make others feel nice and comfy-- is the cookie-cutter atmosphere. Feels like I'm in the Smash Factory or P.F. Burger. lol. Other than that, good job guys!	4	Smashburger	3.5
Always wanted to try this spot. Finally decided to after my daughters soccer game. Staff was fast and friendly. Got a two meat combo of baby back and brisket with corn bread and collard greens. The meat was delicious and tender. Pleasantly surprised. Great job guys. Oh wait. The collard greens were inedible. Tasted like someone dropped a bag of salt in my cup. It was overlooked since the ribs were so tasty.	5	TC's Rib Crib	3.5
Old school. Reminds me of the OG ranch style steakhouses my parents took me to as a kid in Los Angeles. Very distinct sweet hickory smell from their fire pit as you walk up to the building. Sat at the bar to eat lunch and had the rib eye. Perfectly cooked. Came with salad and steak fries. More than enough portions. Best of all (and least expected) was the service. Darla was a ...Dar-ling. Anticipated needs. Very helpful with the menu. Drink was kept full. Super friendly. If on the northern reaches of Las Vegas, I definitely recommend this piece of Vegas history.	5	Bob Taylor's Ranch House	3.5
"Headed home from the Foodiefest and was in the mood for a quick bite...go figure. Anyways, I had been meaning to come by since SG opened. I used to come here a long time ago when it was Sedona. (Had it's run but lost all identity). The place is done really well and should attract an alternative crowd to the super millennials at neighboring Parkway Tavern. 

I ordered the steak and eggs. I must admit I wasn't expecting much. But it was the best I have had in a while. Great cut of meat with a tasty char! Kudos! The staff is super friendly, which is either a sign of a new job or they just like their boss. Either way, I hope SG good fortune. They are doing a swell job! I will be definitely frequenting if the experiences are as great as tonight\/this am."	5	SG Bar	3.5
Took a date here. Totally reminds me of a restaurant era, long lost. During an amazing dinner, I watched Chef Marc (I'm assuming it was he) personally table touch each guest on a busy Saturday night. Wow! Interpersonal contact in this day of age is extra extraordinary. I would give 10 stars if possible.	5	Chef Marc's Trattoria	4.5
Sorry I gotta do this to you but can't let this go unsaid. Come here all the time with my daughter. EVER single time your staff is smiling and holding open doors. So wonderful. It's unfortunate that one bad apple can ruin it for everyone that works so hard. Tonight, Shamikka (sp?) the cashier tonight was one of the most rude people I've come across in a while. Respond if you want specifics. She was also rude and argumentative with coworkers in front of guests. She should either be retrained or released. Only concerned because I pay good money to expect a good time. Not write bad comments in yelp.	1	Dave & Buster's	3
I'm definitely not a connoisseur of coffee, but I love Madhouse! It's located conveniently on the way back and forth from work. It's 24 hour operations is really mad, even for this city. I love taking dates here to unwind right after a nice dinner. Marco the owner is super cordial to all his guests. It really feels like a family spot. Great job and keep up the good work MC!	5	MadHouse Coffee	4
Been coming to this spot since it opened. Tonight I grabbed a bite with my daughter after watching the new Avengers movie. Tonight was the second time that I had Gerard as my server. Super attentive and always with a smile. Great job sir! The gyoza was on point and hearty. Not sure why so many restaurants are downsizing their dumplings these days? Ordered the tonkatsu ramen. The pork was amazingly tender like it should be. Some of the other reviews of the broth say the broth is bland. I would tend to agree. But that's what the condiments at the table are for. Must have used half of the sambal container. Overall great experience for the price and convenience. Keep it up guys.	5	8 Noodle Bar	3.5
I was hesitant to write a review for this spot. It's probably because I have a personal relationship with the owners. But I will never write anything false to bolster ratings. Anyways, Brien and Susan are a true inspiration. Lifers in the business with the most passion that you can truly taste it in the food. I am a big meatball fan and love all the dishes at RockN'oodles that incorporate them. The Great Balls of Fire and Asian wings are my two recommends. If you want to support a true mom-n-pop spot that has great food and passion, look no further. Keep on rockin you guys!	5	Rock'N'oodles	4.5
Been coming here since the day it opened. Had employee Christmas parties here. Many long drinking\/ gambling nights. The big catch is how nice and endearing the staff is to regulars. But also love that they are not afraid to send people home when they are acting up. You definitely get that "Cheers" vibe. Continued success. Oh btw just found out they started brewing their own Nitro coffee from beans roasted down the street at Desert Wind Roasters. Great companies support other local businesses. Whohoo!!	5	Chicago Brewing Company	3.5
We just found this spot for breakfast last weekend and it was awesome! The French toast is amazing and so is the bacon. Can't wait to go back!	5	Truffles N Bacon Cafe	4
Definitely worth the wait!! With this being a celebrity restaurant, the wait was a little long but totally worth it. Top notch customer service. The turkey burger is delicious! Very attentive staff. And the fries will be some of the best you've ever had!	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
The only disappointing thing about Poppa Naps is that they don't have a retail location.  That might be good news because I would literally "pig out" if they did.  Coming from North Carolina I appreciate the true art of slow cooked pulled pork.  Napoleon is an artist.  It is dramatically better than any BBQ I have tasted since moving from NC to Las Vegas five years ago.  Highly recommend if you need a great caterer for your event.  Please invite me!	5	Poppa Naps BBQ	5
"This has to be one of the cleanest fast food restaurants -- including restrooms -- I have visited.  Staff was pleasant and, even though they ran out of ""regular"" chicken (the person before me took out enough for the whole church so I understood), I got half the order and they brought me the rest when it was done (6 minutes).

Some cranky guy came in with an obviously bogus claim for ""free food"" from this feedback coupon and made a total ass of himself.  Manager handled it with skill and later apologized to me and my wife for the crude language used by the dissatisfied con man.

Have been going to Churches (love that okra), but chicken has been overcooked on last few visits.  Tried Popeye's for first time today and found a new chicken home."	4	Popeye's Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits	3.5
"The good news:  Big Catch is the best thing these folks have done in a long time!

The bad news:  As soon as we made it a habit to pick up a Big Catch -- they killed it.

The good news.  The staff here is very pleasant and have to say ""I'm sorry"" a lot, but they do it with aplomb.  

The bad news.  They have to say ""I'm sorry"" so much because of a lousy ordering system where they are always out of something.  Soft drinks one day, shrimp another day, onion rings another day.

But, since I seem to know what they are out of so often, I must like it enough to keep coming back.

I miss the Big Catch!!"	3	Long John Silver's	2.5
Like everyone else here, had to try Gordons restaurant. We went last Monday night and had to wait 30 minutes, not too bad. Loved the atmosphere and decor. I had the British burger, medium rare, with english cheddar, arugula, and mango chutney. The burger is beautifully presented, the bun is gorgeous , looks at first like its alot of bread for the burger but everything was stacked just perfect. The bun is very light and doesnt overtake the rest of the flavors at all. Nice combination of flavor. Great selection of beer and wine chosen through an Ipad menu.Be sure to order the truffle fries....they were so great.	4	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
"Received 75.00 , off for playing MYVegas. yes, its expensive but what good steak house isnt.? I ordered lobster bisque and it was very good, not the best I have ever had but very good. I had the Omaha filet, creamed spinach, variety sauteed mushrooms and sea scallops all to share with my husband. The sea scallops were seared and some of the best I have ever had. For dessert, we shared fresh mango sorbet. delicious! 
Two waiters assisted us through our meal and were very helpful and attentive.I would go back\/
I also ordered a cocktail- Sidecar,  and it was made very well."	4	TENDER Steak & Seafood	3.5
"Apparently I'm a glutton for punishment. All your obvious problems aside you do have the best bagels in Vegas. Of course that is only true if you get the bagels you ordered. 

Stopped in for a dozen after lunch. Yes I understand it's Sunday but coming from NY I still can't believe that if a place runs out of certain flavors they don't make more. Surprisingly you had pumpernickel. Too bad you gave me a shortchanged dozen everything bagels (I ordered 2). Not surprised. I should know by now that the guys behind the counter can't count. Even if you tell them how many of each bagel. Always short 1 or 3. 


So now I really & truly am done with you. No more messed up orders. No more low quality food. No more e-coli from your undercooked frozen burger patties. No more crappy service. No more surly attitudes from counter guys. No more pathetic excuses for a manager. 

I guess I'll have bagels & pastrami again next visit to NY.

*Previous Review

I've been going to Bagel Cafe for 18 years since moving to Vegas from NY. We don't have many choices for Jewish deli here and this place has outlasted any and all competition that have opened. On average we would eat Bagel Cafe once a week until about 10 years ago. From then until last year I was taking the kids once a month & doing take-out once a month. Once in a blue moon they might have an off day. Silly things like wilted lettuce or fries that weren't crispy. The bagels and bialys were always perfect. One time they served me an obviously microwaved knish. Hot and mushy on the outside and frozen in the middle.

Recently consistency has become a huge problem. One day the food is perfect and the next not so much.

Last year while dining in the restaurant my son and I both ordered cheeseburgers, well done. Mine was raw in the center. I put everything on my burger, including the fries so I didn't notice until after I bit, chewed and swallowed & thought to myself 'that didn't taste right.' I looked and I kid you not it was raw in the center. Fortunately my son's burger was well done. I had a lovely 2 week bout with e-coli & didn't eat there for almost a year. I also didn't eat a cheeseburger again for almost a year. I didn't hold them 100% responsible as I could have cut my burger in half to check that it was cooked through. Because everyone does that. Right? But seriously though, I cook every day. Sometimes a burger or steak isn't as done as the other ones. It happens. But it isn't rocket science to push on a steak or burger to check if it's done. There is a big difference in feel between raw and well done.

One day the kids were just dying for Bagel Cafe so I took them. I ordered a cobb salad, one kid got a bagel and the other of course ordered a cheeseburger, well done. When he saw my salad he decided that we would share. Fortunately this time I cut the burger in half and it was raw. Now this indicates to me that the 'chefs' don't know what they are doing or the burgers are frozen patties. The manager removed the burger from my bill.

Today we ordered take-out. Very simple order. 1 pastrami & 2 NY knishes. Simplest thing for a deli, well in NY at least. Also I should note that I was asked if I wanted cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion on that. Drove home with the moon roof open & the hot Vegas sun on the bag. Funny thing, the sandwich was cold & the knishes were ice cold. Okay, fine. Threw the knishes in the oven. Attacked the sandwich. Now I know it's pastrami and it's fatty but it should be meat with fat on it. About 1\/3 of the sandwich was sliced fat with meat on it. Couldn't even chew it. So apparently now they do not know how to cut the pastrami.

The icing on the cake: They shortchanged me on my dozen bagels. By two. Seriously, now you guys can't count?!?

I'm just done. Good bye Bagel Cafe. If I want deli I'll take a flight back home and go to Katz. It would be worth the time and money for a decent sandwich and a knish that hasn't been nuked."	1	The Bagel Cafe	4
"I don't get all the negative reviews. I've been going to this location since it opened & food & service is always perfect. It's IHOP. U know what you're getting going in.  It's gonna be noisy since it's a laid back kid friendly place-it's not that noisy. Ever. It's gonna be busy on the weekend around brunch time-try to be patient if you are going to any restaurant at peak time. It's not a fine dining establishment so I don't expect 'ambience' just cleanliness & every time I've been here it's been spotless. 

Just picked up to go order. No mistakes. Extra syrup for our syrup sponges (pancakes). Everything cooked perfectly-scrambled, over easy & sunny side up. 

Staff was friendly courteous. 

The only time I didn't like the food was when I ordered chicken n waffles but that was me-my son scarfed them down & ordered another one-manager comped the 1st one (totally unnecessary as my kid loved it but the waitress noticed I didn't like it) & I ordered something else. 

It beats Mcd's anytime"	5	IHOP	2.5
food is so great. i liked the french onion soup. it looked so pretty when they serve and it actually tastes better than it looks.  steaks melts in yiur mouth. its a must go to steak house in vegas.	4	Golden Steer Steakhouse	4
Thanks to the the entertainment book guide, we got this place for our first night in Vegas.  Food was great  and service was sweet.	5	Kabuki Japanese Restaurant	4
I like their chicken feet a lot. It melts in your mouth. The place itself is not so great but the dimsum is good enough but not exactly great.	3	Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant	3.5
"This place was good enough to warrant two trips during my short trip to Vegas.

For my first visit to Fresh Grill, I had the buffalo chicken wrap, which may have not been the best idea for a hot day in Vegas. I normally find buffalo sauce to be not spicy enough for me, but the sauce they used here definitely was. I had to keep adding extra ranch dressing to cool my burning mouth.

On my second visit, my friend and I shared the honey mustard chicken wrap, which my tongue thanked me for. 

I love all the different sauces and dippers they provide here. My friends and I tried almost all of them: who knew that Italian dressing tasted so good with seasoned fries?

The wraps are huge: we all took home half of our meals and ate it for dinner later; the second time, we were smart enough to share our orders. The homemade chips are pretty good, but they are inconsistent with how much each order gets. My friends sometimes only got a few pieces plus crumbs, while my serving had loads of chips."	4	Fresh Grill & Bar	3.5
"We got hooked up with a promoter on a Wednesday night who got us free bottle service (until the table was sold, which didn't happen), except we had to share with another group of girls. And the tables are TINY, so... it got pretty crowded. Anyways, open bar till 12:30AM, then bottle service with the promoters so it all worked out.

There was a convention of some sort so the beginning of the night saw a crowd of older folks, so the DJ catered the music towards them. Once they cleared out, he started spinning more hip hop, which was great cuz hip hop is hard to find in Vegas.

The security guard assigned to our table was awesome, really funny and he even escorted my friend to the restroom cuz she didn't know where it was.

Watch out for those tricky tables! The glass is sloped at the end so if you place your drink too close to the edge, your drink will end up all over your shoes.

The club is quite small (it's the same size as a club in Vancouver! Lame) so it gets pretty packed on the dance floor.

A night of highs (free drinks, great music & people) & lows (too many free drinks, people getting kicked out [not me!]), but a great time overall."	4	LAVO Italian Restaurant & Lounge	3.5
"After seeing all the 4 and 5 star reviews for this place, my friends and I knew we had to try it. I was debating between the Full Montagu and the All American: the All American won (this time) - loads of turkey, cranberry sauce, ranch dressing, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes.

The sandwich was packed with fillings. My friend said, ""It tastes like Thanksgiving"" and she definitely wasn't lying. One of the best parts about the sandwich was the bread: baked fresh everyday, it was crispy yet soft at the same time, and it really made the sandwich that much better.

After trying a bite of the Full Montagu, I think that sandwich would have been even better than the All American, which was good but not out of this world good.

It was a cheap, filling lunch, and with so many options to choose from, everyone is bound to find something they like. I would absolutely come back again."	4	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"I went super early for dinner here so there was no wait, but there was a long line as we were leaving. The restaurant has lots of seating, so I don't imagine the wait is too long.

There's a nice salad bar, several different soups, antipasto selections, various buns and bread, pastas as well as a custom pasta station where the chefs make your pasta right in front of you. At the meat carving station, I believe each day they have different options. The day I went, it was turkey and prime rib. The prime rib was AMAZING. It was so tender, and done medium rare, just the way I like it. I had to go back for seconds, it was that good. 

There's a few selections of Indian cuisine as well as Chinese, sushi, and a chilled seafood section (of course, Alaskan king crab legs).

The desserts are in an entirely different section, where it's like its own separate shop full o' sweet things.Gelato, cakes, baked goods, fresh fruit, and a crepe station.

The rating is a little low because while the selection was great, the tastes of the food wasn't as great. The custom tom yum soup was super salty, the veal shortribs were a tad dry, and the stir fried Asian vegetables were absolutely soaked in oil and probably had more than its fair share of MSG. The desserts didn't get any better either: the red velvet cupcakes were dry, most of the cakes were way too sweet, and there was something off about the crepes. It could've been the chocolate sauce, or the strong taste of Pam that the chef used to make the crepe.

Despite some of the lackluster food, I did enjoy the butternut squash risotto, the orecchiette with creamy pesto sauce, and of course, the prime rib (I'll be dreaming about it for months). The baked chocolate brownie was yummy despite the nuts, and the gelato was delicious.

$40 for dinner is a pretty standard Vegas buffet price, and with the Wynn, the ingredients they use are not as common (or cheap) as what other hotel buffets offer, so it's a good deal. I just wasn't completely blown away by the food."	3	The Buffet	3.5
"We were lucky enough to get a table on the patio. The rest of the restaurant is quite dark, but the sunroom is also really nice if there's no space on the patio.

We were here for brunch\/lunch, so I ordered the quiche lorraine. My friends shared the escargot, and had the chicken crepe, croque monsieur, and chicken and brie sandwich.

Everything tasted great, but didn't wow us. Like most French food, everything was quite rich, so it was a pretty heavy lunch. I loved the fries; they were thin and crunchy.

We also shared a pitcher of frangria, which was quite strong (we're not huge red wine drinkers), but with some added lime juice it tasted much better.

Would love to come back to try their steak."	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"My friends and I were looking for a somewhat fancier meal in Vegas, without breaking the bank. Its hard to find in this city, but this restaurant seemed to fit the bill.

We started with the calamari, which was probably the best calamari I have ever had. The pieces of squid were in nice large chunks, and the batter was a golden brown, perfectly deep fried. The garlic aioli accompanying the calamari was delicious but there wasn't enough.

Three of us ordered pizzas while the fourth person ordered gnocchi. The gnocchi was soft and chewy, and was tossed in a thick red sauce. The pizzas were not as delicious as the calamari, which I had thought was going to be a prelude to an awesome meal. The dough was very thin throughout the pie; probably the thinnest pizza I have ever eaten. I had the yukon gold potato pizza, but the potatoes were sliced so thin that I couldn't even taste them. (Upon eating the leftovers the next day, the potatoes even seemed undercooked as they tasted a bit raw). The dough also had a very floury taste to it.

The service was quick and friendly. Our water glasses were kept filled all throughout our meal.

Overall, the pizzas were meh, but the rest of the food was good, and prices are reasonable. I would come back, I just wouldn't order a pizza."	3	Cucina by Wolfgang Puck	4
"Great concept! I loved the individual portions just for the novelty of it. It might be useful to go with a buddy and pick out things to share.

Highlights included the pesto mashed potatoes, prime rib, fried chicken, mushroom risotto, and truffled scalloped potatoes.

Lowlights: ramen (too salty), sushi (I didn't try any, but apparently it was the worst sushi ever), and some of the desserts were disappointing (rock hard red velvet cookies).

Cool idea with the mac and cheese bar, but one bowl can be shared with the table, as it's very rich and creamy, and the portions are pretty big. And you wanna save room for those king crab legs, right?

Maybe this place doesn't have the variety like other buffets, but they offer items that are different or use different ingredients, which makes it more interesting."	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
We just went to Burger Dogs for the first time and we enjoyed it.  We ordered and they told us it would take 8 minutes to cook our burgers and that's exactly how long it took.  The fry order was huge and would easily feed a family of four with leftovers.  The price is about what you'd expect and the food was good.  We would definitely go again.	4	Burger Dogs	2.5

We got the chance to have dinner here after our wedding. It. Was. AMAZING! The food was awesome! The view is indescribable. The atmosphere is excellent and the service was on point. They easily accommodated to our group of 10. We were one of the last tables to be seated that night (9:30 pm) but we did not feel rushed to finish our meal. We were so stuffed from our meal that we passed on dessert, but because we were still celebrating in our wedding attire they brought us out Profiteroles and they were to die for! They even included a special message written in the chocolate sauce. We will definitely be making an anniversary trip to visit this place!	5	MIX	4
I ordered delivery from this place, the toppings are normal quality; but the dough needs to be better, not a lot of flavor in it and it needs to be more toasted.	3	Lefty's Pizza	3.5
We just tried this place for the first time tonight. I called in an order for pick up and got the large pizza and breadsticks special. The special was a great deal. It was ready when they said it would be, staff was courteous, and they even gave my daughter a frisbee. The pizza and breadsticks tasted great. So, overall a great experience and we will definitely be back!	5	Pizza Factory	3
"I'm a Vegas local and recently visited the LVH for a wine tasting and went to dinner at Tatuado after the wine tasting.  Long story short...the street tacos served at the wine tasting were 100x better than the food served at Tatuado.
The chips tasted like they were straight from the bag.  The salsa tasted like it was straight from the bottle.  The potato salad they served tasted exactly like the Reser's kind you get at the deli (in other words, gross).  When I asked for chips with my sandwich, they brought out Sun Chips.  Really?  Everything I ate here I could've bought on my own at my local grocery store.
My friends didn't like their food at all (cheese enchilada and chicken sandwich).  My club sandwich was good.  The biggest positive was the strawberry margarita.  It was delicious.  
Overall, this place was very mediocre.  I wouldn't return.  There are SO many better options in Vegas."	2	Vince Neil's Tatuado Cantina	2
We came here for the first time tonight and sat in the bar. The service was fast and friendly. Our food (Peppercorn Burger and Mac and Cheese) was delicious and came out quickly. The place is clean and not smoky. Our beers were cold and never left empty. Great spot for comfort food. We will definitely return.	5	Montana Meat Company - Durango	3.5
"I've been here twice and been underwhelmed both times. The first time, they charged my debit card 4 times for the same purchase. Tonight, the second time, the service was painfully slow. There was one guy trying to take and make the orders. Finally, when the line was 11 people deep, another person finally came out to help take orders. 
The Dole whip was tasty, but my crepe was meh. There was hardly any filling, and the filling that was in there was so cold it made the entire crepe ice cold by the second bite. Plus, this place is a poor value for the money. We ordered 2 crepes, a small Dole whip, and a bottled water and it was $21!
We won't be back."	2	Pineapple Park	3.5

Hands down best Italian food restaurant I have been to in Vegas and believe me I have tried a lot out here,  being from ny I have been searching for a good place for quite some time, the food here, the ambiance, service, absolutely outstanding,  a little pricey but that comes with fine dining so I don't mind. Highly recommend	5	Capo's Italian Cuisine	4
Last night was our first time here.  Hubby and I have been looking for a nice Italian place to remind us of back home (queens,new york) and we tried many many places in the last 4 years and just couldn't find that special place , well tonight all of that was changed.  This place was wonderful, the food was great, warm Italian bread not cold like some of these other places , the appetizers were delicious, and done the way a Italian place is supposed to do it,  everything was on point.  I highly recommend this place we will def be regulars here.  Our server laura she was great too super nice and attentive. We can't wait to go back!!!	5	Sicilian Ristorante	4
Finally decided to try this place last night, I was a little hesitant being there was only a few cars in the parking lot sometimes that's a red flag but anyway we went ahead, now my husband and I eat out a lot, we go to expensive places and we go to not so expensive places, we have been searching for a good Italian restaurant and have been unsuccessful well that changed last night, the atmosphere is beautiful, the food was amazing, Fransisco our waiter was the best so attentive and so sociable, I cannot wait to return here and I'm so happy my search us over.   Keep up the wonderful service	5	Sergio's Italian Gardens	4
been to this location twice since I live right over there, um I cant say its the greatest place ive been to  but its good.  food was kind of average, fresh, atmosphere nice, clean , friendly staff for the most part but  one thing I did not like is our server did not return at all so my kids were dying of thirst, only time the server came back was to deliver my check.   but overall I would probably go back.	3	Metro Diner	4.5
I was here today for the first time, very cute place a little small but that's ok, the food was really good, food Came out very quickly, reasonably priced.  We will def be returning.	4	Babystacks Cafe	4
Okay so me and my husband dine out a lot and when we dine out  we expect a nice experience.  I was very excited to try this place since it had such great reviews however my excitement went to pure disappointment when I walked in and they sat us at a small tiny ass table right in the middle of the walkway with people bumping into me  and every staff member walking right past us for 15 minutes not even asking us if we want anything to drink,  this table was obviously on the pay no mind list Now normally I'm a nice person I try not to get to diva but this table was actually really ridiculous,   ok enough about that so I went up to the manager and I said to him do you have a different tableabd within I want to say 10 minutes 15 minutes he had a different table for us which was great he was also taken care of also at the end of the night.   Other than the whole table issue everything else was pretty much okay the atmosphere was really nice the food was okay not the best I've ever had but it was good.  I think this place is more interested in catering to larger parties  then a small bill for two people which is understandable that they going to make more money on a larger party then they are two people I get it but still we are paying customers so we should be just as important.  Um I'm not sure I'll come back maybe I will but at least I can scratch this one off my bucket list.  Oh and by the way I never got my free t-shirt with my cannoli purchase so for that reason I'm taking another star off.	2	Casa Di Amore	4.5
First time here a couple of weeks ago , my husband and I go out to eat quite often we were kind of getting tired of the same old spots I googled and this place came up, it was very good, kind of a long wait but the waitress stopped by our table and said they had a mix up in the kitchen fine no big deal we understand but overall cute place the food was good and very  friendly staff  we might be back who knows. So many spots to try its endless here	3	Mr Mamas	4.5
Friends of ours recommended this restaurant and said it was great so the other night my family and I decided to try this place I got the chicken Franchese I can't say it was the best Franchese  I've ever had the chicken was kind of rough and I do know its supposed to melt in your mouth like butter. the carpaccio was okay I liked it.  We all got cannolis for desert my kids wouldn't eat them because they said that the cannoli cream tasted weird I tasted it and it didn't taste like traditional cannoli cream that we are used to but that could totally just be their recipe I'm not sure . Maybe my expectations are a little bit higher living on the East Coast and going to many fine dining Italian restaurants and this one just didn't do it for me. But before I scratch this one off my list totally I'm going to give it one more try	3	Roma Deli 1 & Restaurant	4.5
My family and I eat  at this place alot  it was probably one of the first places we tried since moving from New York  and we love it and we also love the fact that they have good specials it's a cute little neighborhood spot.   Pizza is very good.  Close to home.	4	Familia Pizzeria	4
this store needs a little help compared to some of the other ones around town, they rush you at the register and then get yr order wrong, every single time I go in there this happens , I get into my car and its the wrong breakfast sandwich after I clearly stated what ingredients I don't want.  and they are so slow , last week I waited 20 mins for my banana smoothie.	2	Einstein Bros	3
Just got a sandwich all bread no meat 8 dollars for this.    Pathetic.   For 8 dollars the sandwich should be filled.   Pissed to say the least.	2	Jimmy John's	3.5
Been to this place twice to eat and play the games.  The game part is fine my issue is with the service with food, first of all the menu is weak , selections of food are poor the salads are gross more lettuce than meat.  The second time we came i thought my meal was better than the first time I came however the waiter was horrible hardly came over to the table we sat for 15mins waiting for another drink and another 15 mins for silverware. Then we just wanted our bill and this guy was no where to be found.   Obviously I should learn but my two first choices of where to eat had no availability .   I will try My hardest not to come back here.   And if a manager reads this. Have yr staff get it together.	2	GameWorks	3
My husband and I went here this past sunday we had a 530 reservation, it was not packed at all, The service was great, the food was great and our server Hilda was really nice.   Oh and real cannolis just like NY  yay   we will def be back	4	Trattoria Reggiano	4
Brio is one of my favorite restaurants in vegas my husband and I come here often however tonight I have some different feeling towards this place.   Our server seemed annoyed everytime we asked her for something,  we waited and waited for our apps to come out, one made it to the table one did not, everything took forever, our server disappeared for what seemed like hours,   very poor service tonight and I was not happy.  Get it together brio	2	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
I love this place, my family and I usually come on Sundays for breakfast and Chevy is always usually our server, she is the best, one of the reasons we keep returning here.	5	The Lodge at Shelbourne	3
I went here on sat with my husband for the first time , when I walked in I was like eh  not really sure if I was feeling it but then I ordered some appetizers which was the ceviche and then we had the main course the filet mignon,  well let me just tell you everything was so delicious,  the ceviche was to die for it was not fishy it was fresh it was wonderful, they give you this bread to start with with a delicious pesto sauce I was totally obsessed with it.  Our server  misty was wonderful too, very attentive , we didn't have to ask her for anything , she was spot on , the drinks were flowing, I will totally be back here.	4	Bonefish Grill	3.5
Very cute place, the decor is beautiful here, food was amazing as well I will def be back	4	The Sparklings	4
First time here today Sunday July 25. , kids painting class. , all I can say is excellent , fun fum time. My kids loved it. The instructor  was awesome , great with all the children I cannot wait to take my kids back and I'm scheduling a adult class as well  thank you for a amazing experience	5	Design & Dine	4.5
I live right around the corner from this place so I've been here a few times I really like it here  the atmosphere is nice  service is fine the food is good not great but good but my favorite is their breakfast I really love to come on a Saturday or Sunday morning and get their breakfast. Yum so good.	3	Montana Meat Company - Durango	3.5
Excellent atmosphere. Excellent food.  Our server cesar was wonderful. Such a nice attentive server, very nice guy.  .  We will def be back here again.	5	La Comida	3.5
Meh.   Its ok.  I have lived in NY all my life.  Queens NY to be exact.  Anyway the food is average   My only problem.  The guy behind the counter I wish he would just smile more.	3	Rocco's NY Pizzeria	3.5
Its ok.   Been here twice.  I think the food is ok little dry the pork needs more BBQ sauce.  The lady behind the counter is not to friendly I asked her for a refill she seemed bothered.  They should take yr order outside because while waiting inside it gets very claustrophobic. The space is to small to conduct a line.	3	Big Ern's BBQ	3.5
My family and i have been going  to Jacky Chan for quite some time now ,   I will  say it's really good Chinese food not too greasy pretty good the only downside is we  like to dine  there but I can't stand their chairs they are  the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat on but other than that we love this place.	3	Jacky Chan	3
Had a reservation at 7:45pm this evening. In town for Sema & am in town for Work and bring clients. Got sat outside, no problem. 8:15 rolled around, still no service, no water, no your server will be right with you. 8:25 I finally found and told the server that we've been waiting for a long time and she said it'd be a while. So we had to leave and go to the strip. I was excited to go downtown and have a nice steak and bottle of wine meal but it ended real quickly with no service.  Very upset that I didn't get to try the place. I understand being busy but I also think you should be able to get someone water and at least say hello and acknowledge them.	1	Triple George Grill	4
Went during new years holiday. Crazy long lines price of lunch buffet 40.00 plus. Add unlimited mimosas before 2 for 10.00. Not bad.  The lunch menu is a pretty good selection and delicious. Omelets are still being prepared,  fresh smoothies in glass sealed jars, desert menu on point. my top lunch buffet.  Next time I'm trying dinner hopefully there is seafood	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"I should start out by saying that I live in NYC so I have several Chinatowns near me and have high expectations of chinese food.  That being said, the food was good but not great.  The main issue is the food was never hot.  I did go twice but only because I really wanted to try the Seafood Pan fried Noodles. I wasnt thrilled with it.  

The first day, I had the lunch special of chicken, shrimp and beef with garlic sauce and 2 mini spring rolls (the app should have been served earlier than the main and it was not, so tell them if you want it that way).  That dish was excellent and had it been hot, it would have been stellar.  It came with white rice.  The lunch special is 18.99 and they have about 8 choices of specials; my dish was enough for 2.  Service was slow the first day and quick the second day. My water was refilled constantly and the waiters were very nice as was the Maitre D.  It is a casual restaurant located right off the casino so there is some people watching to be done if you get a table closer to the front.  

I would recommend the restaurant for the chicken, beef, and shrimp dish but not for the pan fried noodles. I also would be specific and ask for very hot food and apps served first. None of these requests should be needed but if done, this review would have been markedly higher."	3	Noodle Shop	2
"If only NO STARS!! 

I have never received this level of rude service, this takes the cake as number 1 worst experience.  By the way the couple to my left were not of the African American descent and receiving a better service. The couple to the right of me noticed the same as they were also receiving rude service.  I can understand a bad day but this was ridiculous. I walked away not eating and vowing never to come back. Horrible service and mishandling of the food.   

My fiancee and I decided to walk across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and noticed Johnny Rockets to grab a quick bit. We weren't greeted but still sat down at the counter to eat, still no greet but luckily there was a menu available. So we waited about ten minutes as I observed three servers on shift. Finally, the gentlemen server approaches the couple next to us and says ""I see no one took your order yet"" it was pretty rude but true. After he took their order, I asked ""can I please place my order as well as I've been waiting,he replied ""I'll try"". He then takes the order and walks away to the back. So we waited another 10 minutes, I ask the tall waitress with red hair ""can I please get a water"" she gets it and slams it down. The couple next to us asked for their drinks and the waitress said ""I didn't take your order so what do you want"". So about another 15 minutes passed, in that time I observed the cook on his phone and then heading back to the grill without washing hands, bacon that wasn't properly cooked from a previous order placed on another order. I didn't walk away then. So I wanted to check the status of my order so I asked another server (short female w\/black hair)about my order, she went to check and came back to say ""who assisted you"" I described the gentlemen with the glasses. She asked him about the order and he replied ""transfer the checks, I'm out"". To hear that upset me, I spoke my frustration  to the wrong employee. The female with the short hair was very polite and I felt bad that she had to deal with the rude service I was receiving."	1	Johnny Rockets	2.5
Went around New Year's,  great location and hours. Good looking menu, next time I'm trying the duck bacon burger. The truffle fries are delicious,  I enjoyed the aioli but not the ketchup.  My fiancée was first hesitant of the ketchup but at the end raved about it. I just got the regular burger and it was pretty good. I will go again on next visit.  Reason for three stars my waiter never checked on us until it was check time.	3	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
Huge portions of food.  Oh my goodness I really like this place.  It was breakfast time servers were in the pajamas,  place was busy but not once were we unattended to.  My fiancée got the Andy sage fried chicken or shall I say man vs food choice.  I got the neapanee hash lunch special.  Both dishes were so good. Food comes hot as there is no hot lamps or microwave as soon as it's done, food is straight to you. Fresh squeezed oj. Bartender is heavy on the hands  This place is a must visit! !	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
They wouldnt refill my cup of water! What place doesnt allow its customers to drink tap water? Such rude service	1	Kung Pao Wok	2
"So disappointed!! Came here for Mother's Day and what a joke. We heard that the food was good but we're obviously expecting something this place doesn't understand or care about.
With all the competition in Vegas, we won't be back"	1	Giada	3.5
"First time here and wow, my Baja burger is crazy good!
Fries are perfect. Good job you guys!!"	5	Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar	4
Friendly staff. Large portions. Fine prices. Mediocre food. I only gave this place 4 stars because they are pet friendly!!	4	The Original Sunrise Cafe	4.5
"The only reason I'm placing 2 stars is because the food was good. 

The wait staff on the other hand were rude, and not very helpful.
When we were being seated the hostess rolled her eyes at us right when we walked in and we had noticed she was doing her homework for school. While we were being seated we had asked if we could add an extra 2 seats and the waitress who was serving us also rolled her eyes, I'm not sure if they were having a bad day or what not but I also work in the restaurant business and never once have I rolled my eyes at my guests. The last few things I'm gonna post are they shut off the main lights on us while still eating because they said they were closed and our waitress forgot one of our guests meal."	2	Steak 'n Shake	3.5
Everytime I visit Las Vegas I always stopped by Planet Dailies and ordered either the Lobster fettuccini, or the amazing Mac n Cheese. I'm sad to say during this visit I was slightly surprised and disappointed. One main reason was because of the change in portion size, I used to pay $20.99 for a delicious filling dinner size of lobster fettuccini now I barely just had enough to satisfy my stomach. I think the portion is appropriate for lunch time but for dinner they should make it a bit more.	3	Planet Dailies	3
"I think I died and went to heaven, and heaven has a name: It's Amena. 

I haven't had anything Mediterranean since I left Detroit about 2 years ago, mostly because there truly wasn't anywhere to get it in the places I've lived since then. I walked into Amena with high hopes because of good Yelp reviews and I was NOT disappointed. 

I had a chicken shawarma plate, falafel, lentil soup, and a couple of pastries (baklava and another that I really have no idea what it was, but it was delicious). Everything about it was perfect and just as I had remembered it should taste, and the falafel and baklava might have been the best I've ever tasted. The lentil soup was also exceptional! The staff are very welcoming and made my experience just that much sweeter; I could not have asked for a better local deli\/restaurant! 

Run, don't walk, to Amena. You won't regret it."	5	Amena Bakery & Deli	4.5
"Maybe it's cause I'm from SoCal but the food here was just ok with a hefty price.

Nothing I ate blew me away and definitely not going to be a second home for me haha"	3	Pinches Tacos	4
"This place is pack 24\/7 and smells great outside. They also have a unique system for ordering similar to food court.

Asada - taste burnt but it isn't

Chorizo - alright

Adobada - good

Soderos- ok

Cabaeza- wasn't chewy as I expected

$2 per tacos so pretty pricey. It's not bad but definitely a nice place to try."	3	Tacos El Gordo	4.5
"The chicken is on point. Better that chic Gil a.

Chic fil a sauce is better though.

Garlic bread was amazing.

Price is good too.

Cole slaw was extremely generic."	4	Raising Cane's	4
"A break fast only place usually exist cause it's good or it's the only place open.

The omelette is good but should contain more cheese.

Hash browns were meh. Rye bread was tasty and same for French toast.

Not bad at all and affordable price. Easy parking too. A"	4	Mr Mamas	4.5
I'm usually not a fan of teriyaki sauce but this one was really good. Cheap price with large portions. I recommend it if you're on a budget	4	Aloha Specialties	4
"Disappointed. There's a lot of options but nothing catch my eyes at all unfortunately. Price is also really high.

Definitely recommend other buffets over this"	2	The Buffet at Luxor	2.5
"Really good carne asada fries and less than five minutes from the strip 

Their green sauce is good too. Definitely a hit and I wouldn't mind eating here again"	4	Roberto's Taco Shop	3.5
"I don't know what to say, all they serve is chicken fingers and it's great. Love their toast and fries too.

Only thing that I'm not excited about is the Cole slaw

Cheap, good food, nice service, and easy parking. Thumbs up"	5	Raising Cane's	4
"It didn't feel like a seafood buffet at all. Price was also really high but the food was ok at least.

There's not any one thing that's really good about this place. Organic green tea, amazing food, service is outstanding. Our old go-to was I love Sushi but no more.
Sushi Hiro is excellent!!"	5	Sushi Hiro	4.5
Got all the way home to discover that my Dr Pepper was all plain soda water because the syrup ran out. I called in to tell them and the phone rang 58 times. Then the manager said "yeah I just changed it..." no apology, no compensation, just dead air on the other end of the line. .. never again...	1	Taco Bell	3
It has beer, but not a beer spot. It's More of a sports bar. Extremely loud TVs. Not a. Craft beer or brewery type feel.	2	Beer Park	3.5
We had a great time here, the service was excellent and the food was great! The only reason I didn't give five stars is my sons steak was kind of bland! It was a good cut, nice size, just almost taste like they forgot to season it! But with a little A-1 he was a happy kid again!	4	Claim Jumper	3
We spent an afternoon here. I love all the high end stores that they had to offer. The place is pretty big so a lot of walking. It's outdoor setting so you will get a lots of sun tan. Very clean environment.	4	Las Vegas North Premium Outlets	4
This place has pretty good breakfast menu. Love it here but there always is a wait of 20 minutes.	5	BabyStacks Cafe	4
"Great food. Happening environment. I love their burgers. Very juicy and tasty. This place is portion control though.
Definitely will be back. I also like their Summerlin location too."	5	Bachi Burger	4
"I gotta say that this is my favorite Tai place in Vegas!
We live nowhere near it but make the 20 minute drive each way from work when it's what we have to have."	5	WTPho	4
This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Top shelf dining experience all the way, and, love the location in the Forum at Caesars. The shops, statuary, Roman finishes, the ever changing sky and the scale of it all is so impressive. Location, location, location as the saying goes and this venue is in a good one for sure. Here for a sweet dinner date so for me pull out the stops and have some fun. A nice Chardonnay, apps, excellent table service, braised duck and sea bass entrees, and some beignets for Ben on the dessert side. Great experience and a bit further along the fire laden animatronics show outside Cheescake Factory is awesome!	5	Spago by Wolfgang Puck	4
"Josh S. told me about this local Vegas place that has magical blueberry vanilla wheat beer. It sounds grosse but is in fact beautifully brewed, very smooth and tasty! This brew is now one of my top favorite beers of all time. Truly stellar!

The food is also very well prepared. I only eat meat sparingly and could not pass up the Trio of Filet Mignon Sliders appetizer (three broilded tenderloin filets topped w\/ sautéed mushrooms & onions). The light and fluffy bread melted in my mouth along with the perfectly cooked Filet Mignon meat.

To save room for the beer, I chomped on a light Asian Ahi Salad (rare seared Ahi Tuna, mixed greens, toasted cashews, daikon sprouts, fresh tomatoes, w\/ a Wasabi PlumVinaigrette).The Ahi Tuna was perfect and the dressing was good enough to bath in! So yummy! 

Sadly I only had enough room for the one beer but was eyeing the 50oz glass for my collection..next time. This place is a must for locals and visitors alike, regardless of its off-the-strip location. BTW, there is also a cool upstairs with games, additional bar, lounge, video poker, cigars\/humidor and outdoor dining for cool nights."	5	Chicago Brewing Company	3.5
"Living in Tejas, it's easy to get good Mexican food. I'd say this is baja at best. The taquitos were ok...I'm not big on cheese rolled up and fried. The guac was fresh and very tasty. I had the Fish Tacos Baja Style and I have definitely had better...these were way bland. 

I had a bite of Michael's dish and it was FANTASTIC...the Sabana de Pollo with Chimichurri (paper thin seared chicken breast topped with beans, melted cheese, grilled onions and serrano chile served with rice and pico de gallo salsa)...and I don't like chicken.

And I've never met a fried ice cream I didn't like...this was one of the best.

This menu is hit-or-miss...the items are either incredible or completely blah. The service was great, probably due to who we were sitting with...i'll take it though."	3	Pink Taco	3.5
"First off, this place is totally not my style. The bf and I decided to live it up for the weekend. The food was pricey but amazing!! 

I ordered the Gnocchi with Sauted Lobster, Baby Portobello, Roasted Leeks, Black Truffle Crema....INCREDIBLE!

Good portions, Great flavors, Nice atmosphere."	5	Fiamma Italian Kitchen	4
"Of all the buffets at the casinos in Vegas, this is the worst yet...not bad, but there was a re-occuring theme of just-ok-ness throughout the meal. I'm referring to the overcooked cuts of meat, crappy dessert selection, cold food (when it should have been hot) and most of all, the lack of labeling the food stations (which pissed me off the most). It was aggravating to have to go to the front of the lines just to see what the food was or to view the itty-bitty food description signage.

I will say, good selection of shrimp."	2	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
"Had a great time here with 7 of my friends for a bachelor party.  We got the 3rd floor cabanas with private driving range within close proximity to the pool  Ashley was awesome at helping me plan this all out and our time slot of 3pm - 6pm was perfect, as we had an awesome view of the LINQ ferris wheel and most of the strip from the driving range.  

Food and bottle service\/drink prices are actually very reasonable by Vegas standards and our servers (Jasmin and another gal) were awesome to work with.  

Definitely a great place to go to for a huge crowd and I highly recommend the 3rd floor cabana\/driving range, as it had a great crowd and a lively mix of people, mostly under 40 (which did surprise me a bit...maybe we came there at a good day?).

All in all, I had a great experience and highly recommend this place!"	5	Topgolf	4
"This place is really good!!! The BEST hamburgers I've had so far!!! I would definitely visit this place again, the place is clean and the service was good too, no complaints.

 I wish there was one in northern cali...."	5	Grind Burger Bar and Lounge	4
I always ate here. Every time! We found a plastic piece from a bread bag in our butter and no one came over and apologized or offered anything. It was very matter of fact and no importance to customer service or value at all. It's sad because we will now need to find a new breakfast place to eat. Wish their customer service was a bit better. When we left the server didn't even look us in the face when she nonchalantly said "thank you have a nice day" like it was pulling teeth. We are going back to the Griddle or New Day.	1	Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place	4
"Now everybody clap your hands...CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP! 

While having brunch, the electric slide song came on, and everyone was singing along and dancing. We were def in Vegas! 

We came here after being to Hash House a Go Go in San Diego. We were craving the Bloody Mary, and was a little disappointed when we got it. It was good, but didn;t have as much flavor as the location in SD. 

Portions are big, food is alright."	2	Hash House A Go Go	4
"After partying at Surrender, we came here at 3AM for 4th meal. I was so happy when I found out there was a 24hr KBBQ place on the strip. 

In my intoxicated state, we ordered the AYCE. This was a really big 4th meal, and I regretted it the next day. The meat was alright. Nothing special, and I'm sure if I were sober, it wouldn't have tasted the same. 

If I do come here again, it would probably be because I'm hungry and drunk."	2	Kimchi Korean Bbq	3
Best steak house around! Not only is there a quaint ambiance, the food is delicious, and the service is spectacular. Our server Andrew was accommodating,  pleasant, and personable.  We will definitely be back!	5	Triple George Grill	4
FRESH SQUEEZED orange juice, great selection of food, get the "cup of bread" for your side. If you hate Ihop and Denny's you'll LOVE IT HERE!	5	Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place	4
Ordered from here because it was recommended on Post Mates. THIS IS THE WORST TASTING Vietnamese food I have ever eaten. The BBQ pork (it could have been beef because it was so gross) was so bland and not grilled. It tasted as if they just threw it in a wok or boiled it. Honestly. The bun vermicelli had nothing in it. No peanuts. No cilantro. No flavor. Nothing. I will never order from here again. If you want GOOD authentic, go to Pho Kim Long or Pho Saigon by LVAC on eastern.	1	Pho T	3.5
Let me preface this review by saying that I have been coming here for over a year. Love the shoyu ramen, chashu, curry etc...However, tonight will be the last time I go because I found hair in my shoyu ramen and when I notified the waitress she told me that they wear hats in the kitchen, so she doesn't think its their fault. The hair was obviously not  mine because it was black and no one in my party has black hair. I explained I would take a small replacement as opposed to the large I ordered since I ate some until I found the hair. She then had to check to see if she could since they wear hats. Kidding?! Needless to say, I will never go back. Not even a sorry...just an implication that it had to be me cus they wear hats. What a shame...	1	Ramen Sora	4
Kaba Curry is the best curry. Everything here is great! Recommend to everyone!	5	Kaba Curry	4
"You have to try this place in the Aria casino. Everything is good. I eat here 2 times a year - which is exactly how many times a year I am in Vegas. 

Wings are fantastic. 

Pad thai is killer. Get it a little hot. I got it at a 7. 

Pepper beef udon- amazing. 

Soooooo good. :)"	5	Lemongrass	3.5
"Went in on a Thursday around 2pm. No line. I ordered the SmokeShack and the ShackBurger with cheese fries and a root beer. 

The staff was amazingly good. Friendly. Helpful. Funny. 

Order was up in less than 10 min. 

Food was killer. All of it was very good. I ran out of root beer and they gave me free refills. Free water is available by the condiments also btw. 

Great spot for a great burger in Vegas."	5	Shake Shack	4
"A friend who lives in the area suggested we go here one night while we were in town for my bachelorette party. It's just off the strip but the cab ride is WELL worth it!

We had a reservation and our party of 6 was seated right away. The restaurant was packed the whole time we were there. We started off with a pitcher of sparkling sangria and a pitcher of mojitos. I only had the sangria but it was very light, refreshing and had plenty of fresh fruit in it. 

A rundown of what we ordered. All the plates were enough of us to each have a bite or two.
-Smoked salmon toasts: tasty, but the dill sour cream was more sour cream, very little if any dill flavor. We ordered a 2nd round of these however
-Bacon wrapped stuffed dates: a recommendation from Jesus and SO GOOD. Warm, nutty flavored and saltiness from the bacon. We ordered a 2nd round of these and would have probably ordered more if we weren't so full. One of the best things I had all night
-Fries: fine, but nothing to write home about. Just french fries. Save the sauce from the spicy shrimp and dip these in it. YUM.
-Mac n cheese: another recommendation from Jesus. Cheesy, creamy, rich and delicious.
-Camarones a la diabla: sauteed shrimp in a spicy sauce. Great spice, plump shrimp and the sauce was to die for. We ordered a 2nd round of these as well and kept both plates of the sauce so we could dip our fries and bread in it
-Albondigas: meatballs in a tomato sauce. A little bit of spice and very tasty. 
-Empanadas: filled with pork and beef I think. These were not my favorite. Just kind of blah.
-Ham and Cheese Croquetas: lightly fried, crispy little bites. 
-Crispy duck roll: I'm not a duck fan so I only had a small bite of this. It's covered in a sour cherry sauce which I did not enjoy. Too sour and too cherry for my liking. And it was kind of soggy. 

We ended up ordering another pitcher of sangria through dinner also. Best part of dinner is when the ticket came (which already included gratuity), it was only  $210. Each of us got out of there with a full belly, a buzz and it didn't drain our wallets! A gem right off the strip."	5	Firefly	4.5
"Walking back to our hotel at 5am after a night of partying, we were starving. We'd heard of this Earl of Sandwich and wandered around till we found it. The line was very long but moves super quick. You just order at one register and follow the line down to the 2nd register and pay, and by that time your sandwich is ready! 

We had gone to Planet Dailies the night prior to get sandwiches after a night of partying and they were $13 a piece and not nearly as good as Earl's sandwiches. Do yourself a favor and make this your only late-night food stop!"	5	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"We were in Vegas for a girl's weekend and went to Mesa Grill on Saturday night. We called and got reservations and were seated on time. Our waiter seemed mildly annoyed serving two mid-20s girls. We are both in the service industry so it was unfortunate he regarded us this way. We had the white peach margaritas, which were great. Not too sickly sweet. Everything on the menu looked so good, I had a hard time deciding what to get. Our waiter excellently described the use of heat and mentioned his favorites on the menu. I chose the mango crusted tuna steak with walnut cous cous and green chile sauce and it was excellent. The cous cous had a great nutty flavor that complimented the mango and green chile. The lady next to us complained that it was 'over the top salty' but she was off her rocker :)

My friend had the duck breast which was also very good. We had an excellent meal and I would most definitely go back. The only downside was that our waiter seemed as if he was annoyed and it was a pain to come back and check on us. We still left over a 20% tip as we are in the industry, but would have left more if he didn't disregard us immediately because we were young."	4	Mesa Grill	4
"This use to be our go to place.  Now the service is horrible. 

Last night 11\/23\/2013 we ordered shrimp chow mein which is my favorite aside from wonton soup.  

The service for take out   was a bit better then actually dining in. 

Our order was ready in about five min,  i double checked my order  the sauce and the noodle are seperate. They gave us more then enough of both the broth and noodle. The taste was ok (eatable)    was not the best !   Like the one in Cal. 

And it satisfied the craving."	2	Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant	2
"My husband and I came here yesterday for lunch.  I always wanted to grab a bite here (since forever). 

I dont know what I was thinking! 

The restaurant is clean, the hostess was nice, we where seated fast. Its why i give it one star ONLY

Our first server was a total d*** we were brought our drinks but threw us our straws on the table.  
He also brought us the famous cheddar bay biscuits, they where deli. (4).

Our second server seemed to be rushing us. As i have never been to this restaurant. She kept asking what i will be having. She didnt even give me a min more. 

My husbands plate was better and more full of shrimp then mine. By the way mine was more expensive. 

He loved his plate, me on the other hand i was not satisfied. I was not full nor was it the best ive ever had. 
the shrimp on my plate which their was two diff, kinds the one that was suppose to be cooked was raw.  (Someone cant tell me other wise. why, because im a shrimp lover.   I could have done a way better job myself. )  

The breaded shrimp on my plate was ok.  

The salad that came with my plate was gross three crutons too much dressing with a little bit off romaine lettuce.  Didnt even want too finish it 

My soda ran out it took the waiter a good min. Too notice  she then a couple mins later noticed and i was brought a full soda

Our cheddar bay biscuits finished before we even got our main course.  She never brought us more.

We where totally ignored. 

Even when we where done eating we had to get up and look for our own server. My husband had to go ask the hostess, she had to go look for her. 

It was a total waist of time and our money.
It was horrible experience.

I will NEVER come to dine here again!  Total waist once again. I will never recommend this place either  !"	1	Red Lobster	3.5
Let me start by saying that Oliver (the man at the cash register) is the sweetest, most welcoming man that ever helped me in any restaurant\/cafe! I love this cute, small cafe! The food prices used to be cheaper but I could imagine how hard it would be to keep those prices. They used to have a you pick two (1\/2 sandwich, 1\/2 soup, 1\/2 salad) for $5-$6 but it raised a dollar which is still pretty okay. He took the time to explain the items that aren't on the menu. I ordered the Moroccan which was grilled chicken, roasted tomatoes and roasted peppers, goat cheese, some kind of aioli mixed with North American spices. It was great! I also ordered a 1\/2 turkey sandwich and a cup of onion soup. I really wanted to try the lemon tart and the seasonal fruit tart but I was just too full for that. The fact that mostly all their food items are organic and they can make it gluten free is awesome! Their meats aren't processed. They baked everything the morning of. Everything is fresh. What more can you ask for. Vegas needs to have small cafes like this in every corner!	5	Baguette Cafe	4.5
"If I could give this restaurant negative stars I would. My boyfriend and I were on a double date and we decided to stop by for happy hour. We were greeted when we first walked in and requested to sit outside but we were told that they were not serving outside? It was such a beautiful day I wouldn't see why. So we requested for a booth seeing that there was hardly anyone in the restaurant (after experiencing the horrible service I understood why). The hostess sat us at the booth all the way in the back by the kitchen when she could have sat us in the front. 

Our waitress came by and didn't even introduce herself or even smiled. She gave us our menus and went to go get our water. When we ordered a couple of beers she asked for our ID's and couldn't even do simple math in her head to figure out our age. Then when she finally figured out we were old enough she thought our ID's were fake! LOL! She didn't even know anything about what kind of beers they had... Come on, you have to know what you're selling. That's like going to a car dealership and the salesman knowing nothing about cars! When I ordered my fish tacos and asked for lettuce instead of cabbage she said ""No. I don't think we even have lettuce in the kitchen. Our menu is different from other restaurants you can't substitute anything."" Uhhhhh they have Caesar Salad on their menu so what do they make that with? 

I wouldn't go back to this restaurant even if I was paid to. A restaurant is only as good as their workers. Listen to all the other reviews and go someplace where the workers actually know what they are serving!"	1	Chayo Mexican Kitchen + Tequila Bar	3
Love this cafe! The gentleman that helped me was very friendly! I needed help on deciding what pastry I should get and he suggested the raspberry scone and boy it was so good! It wasn't dry at all! Just the way I like my scones. I got a peach tea but next time I definitely need to try their nutella frappucino! And I believe I saw a sign on their pastries being only $1 from 5pm-8pm!	5	Sunrise Coffee	4.5
I'm not sure if I had really good Italian food before but this restaurant was just okay to me. I felt like their garlic bread could have been frozen before because I could probably find bread like that in the grocery store. From all the great reviews, I was expecting freshly made bread with a rustic outer layer that you see all the top Italian restaurants have. I ordered the crazy fettucini that had everything in it. A little too much going on there. The pizza was good. Nothing will beat the East Coast. It was super dead and I was expecting the restaurant to be super busy! If you sign up for their e-club you get a free appetizer and dessert which is awesome! Our server looked like she was having a bad day on top of this. Maybe it was just bad timing. I'll definitely give it another try but not anytime soon.	3	Nora's Italian Cuisine	4
I usually come to Maggiano's if I want decent Italian food. Not anything amazing like you would find in other cities. I have noticed that the only difference of lunch and dinner are the prices but the same portion? Very interesting. Usually the lunch portion would be way smaller but I really could not tell the difference. The party\/family style is definitely NOT worth the price. I do admit that Maggiano's is probably not even comparable to Bucca but still they overprice their food too much when I could probably get the same thing at a small family owned business. It doesn't help that it's on the strip. The service is great! Make sure if you go on a holiday or a very busy weekend to make reservations! The portions are great but the quality...hmm....I'm the type that prefers quality over quantity.	3	Maggiano's Little Italy	4

Halfway through my new ultimate spicy skillet, there was no potatoes half of my plate was gone before I even started! The only crazy think about this skillet is that half of it was gone when it got to my table! Why Denny's why I'm always here why this time??	1	Denny's	2
I like two types of Ramen we ordered. Very traditional and very Japanese style. The service is like home style, very warm hearted! Strongly recommended!	5	Go!ku	4
Best Poke in Las Vegas. Hands down! Probably in the US. Portions are HUGE. They don't charge extra for the good toppings like many other poke places, and they are super clean and hygienic around all of the food. Hope this place tales over Vegas!	5	Poke Poku Hawaiian Poke Bar	4.5
HORRIBLE FOOD AND SERVICE!!!!  The waitress was clueless, and it took her 15 mins to get chocolate milk for my son, when I asked her why it took so long she said " choco. milk is alot of work!" WHAT?!  their was only 2 other people int he place by the way. she brought cold, hard bread for my son to snack on. THEN we got our pizza and found a LONG HAIR in it. they took it back, and made us another one and it was barely  cooked. Needless to say, my whole family is taking turns on the toilet as I type this. Plus the manager couldn't even come out and say anything to us and then they made us PAY for part of the meal, when the whole thing should have been comped. I would strongly stay away from this place. The pizza is the worst I have ever had and the service sucked. I am off to find a heating pad to help my aching stomach.	1	Dom DeMarco's Pizzeria & Bar	4
"In town for a Gartner conference with my wife and her parents. Not everyone in the group is fond of raw fish, but I am. 

Nick provided excellent service and suggested some phenomenal food. I don't think you can go wrong. The fusion of flavors and cultures create an amazing sensation for all palets."	5	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
after a long day working the builder show we all went for a great dinner. French Onion!! just wow...  Blue Cheese Crusted Filet Mignon was great..but next time ill just go without the cheese.... some awsome wine suggestions 2009 D.R.

Great Japanese tapas. We tried almost everything there and there was nothing that was bad. Everything was delicious and very authentic. My favorite was the garlic chicken gizzard. YUMMMY in my tummy!	5	Ichiza	4
Bulgogi nachos, BBQ pulled pork sliders, and wontons.  Everything was so delicious, I can't wait to go back and try everything else.  Great service, great people, and delicious food!	5	KoMex Fusion	4.5
"The Cal Italia is heaven on a plate - I never knew I wouldn't miss tomato sauce on a pizza.  Some pizzas here are better than others, but this is the best pizza in town.   The calamari is delicious.  I don't know why I keep ordering the garlic bread because every time I get it, it is a little bland, and there is no salt to be found on the table...ugh.

The best part of the meal on Saturday night was the service by Sommer!  She was, far and away, the best server I've had in years...anywhere!  She was five-star service all the way, and she explained everything thoroughly.  I need a copy of the weekly staff schedule so I can come in and sit with Sommer every time!!!!  She is spectacular!  

And Pizza Rock plays the best music!"	4	Pizza Rock	4
"Worst cut of meat EVER, and a $60 ribeye, no less.  Horrible, snobby service from Athena.  I would have sent the steak back, except Athena never even bothered to return to the table or ask how the meal was, and we had to go to Garth.  I guess she was still irritated that I didn't order the $212 Kobe (she seriously sneered at us...on a $500 meal where we still left more than 20%, my own fault because she didn't deserve it).  Do NOT waste your money.  Marc LoRusso should be ashamed because I know Michal Mina trained him better than this.  This place is garbage.  Vegas has a million awesome steakhouses, and you are better off at any of those.  I was there on Friday, May 21st, and, five days later, I cannot stop ranting to everyone I know about how bad this place is.  

And just as a general FYI on the other food: it was all average.  Same bread as every other steakhouse.  Tuna Tartare was decent.  Asparagus and burrata salad was mediocre and the asparagus was overcooked.  The mac & cheese was average.  The artichokes (Roman style) were horrifying...no salt, no flavor, tasted like tree bark.

This place has amazing desserts.  I just wish the pastry chef would go somewhere else, so I could get s'mores doughnuts with a good meal."	1	Botero	4
Cajun albacore was delicious! Service a little slow today but friendly staff and good apps, sushi and rolls!	4	Oyshi Sushi	3.5
The duck wings are great., with the spicy flavor embedded in the sweetness. The all American burger is cooked to my order, but it is just OK. The lobster shrimp macNcheese is a little grease, but does have a lot of lobster meat and shrimps. The butcher steak is totally pver cooked, and not hot at all when it is served. Our waiter is very friendly and ask the kitchen for  replacement. Our foods come in very slowly, and my kids asked me a thousand times when our food will be here. The overall service is ok, and foods are good.	4	Tom's Urban	3.5
"I feel like dining on the Strip has changed - lots of flash, but not much substance. Beauty & Essex was really pretty, but the food kind of fell flat for me.

My husband and I started with the Ceasar Toast with crispy chicken skin. The dressing was a bit overwhelming and it was missing the crunch of the skin I was hoping for.

We shared the empanadas, which were good, but tasted mostly of jalapeno and melty cheese; no complaints, but not exactly special and were only four small pieces. We ended the savory portion of the meal with the chicken meatballs (three to an order). Again, they were just fine...not something I would suggest or eat again.

My husband read that the donuts with dipping sauces were supposed to be good, so we ended the meal with those. The portion was pretty good for the price (a pleasant surprise!) and the dipping sauces were rich in their respective flavors. The donuts were oversized donut holes coated in cinnamon sugar. I had no issues with them but again, I'm unsure as to why they came so highly recommended.

Overall, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. As other reviewers have said, it was very loud. I expected to be wow-ed, or to at least be more full, upon leaving, but I left wishing we had chosen somewhere else to dine."	3	Beauty & Essex	4
"Worst restaurant experience! The place was filthy and had ants crawling everywhere, the waitress was rude and the food was terrible! Their idea of a burger is a piece of meat on a wheat bun, and they burned the pasta. The fact that this place can be considered a good restaurant just blows my mind! 

Apparently if you put terrible food on a fancy plate it makes it more valuable........."	1	Ruby Tuesday	3.5
"We went here a couple days ago, I wasn't very impressed. The decor of the place is cute, VERY purple and very personal, small mom & pop type of place. The water tasted weird but we're in Vegas and all the water I taste EVERYWHERE tastes like a weird mineral deposit, so what do I know.

On to the actual food:

I ordered beef & vermicelli noodles. Pretty good standard fare, beef tasted good, etc. The sauce was a little less flavorful than I'm used to and overall I'd say it was average verging on good. My partner ordered beef pho. She has low standards but I've gotta say this pho was pretty strange. The broth tasted unusually of cinnamon and the beef was FULL of fat & incredibly overcooked. She was picking the huge amounts of bad cuts of meat out of her bowl the entire night (like literally, strings and gobs of beef fat). I totally get that the beef in pho is supposed to be softer than normal beef, but seriously this stuff was so overcooked it was vaguely gummy and would've been best appreciated by someone with no teeth.

Overall I'd say average\/not-so-good. Might not be back."	2	Viet Bistro	3.5
WOW. Amazing! We got takeout, bulgogi entree and bulgogi fries. I didn't realize I had been craving bulgogi until it was in my mouth, at which point I died from how delicious it was. Definitely going to try eating at their restaurant as well.	5	KoMex Fusion	4.5
This place is amazing. We came on a game day, and their game day menus are incredibly cheap. Go check it out!! I didn't drink anything, had work in an hour - but the people who were drinking in our group all got their drinks promptly, said they were delicious. Good service too. I haven't ordered off the Chinese menu yet, I've got to head back and do that!! Overall an awesome place with great atmosphere.	5	Four Sevens Sports Bar & Restaurant	4
"I'm not really feeling the love for this place. This was the first Roberto's I've been to and it may be the last. I ordered guacamole here and I swear to god, it came out in a paste. A $4.00 paste, what a ripoff. It looked like they had mixed together sour cream and some green food coloring. I don't know what that was, but it was not guacamole.

The food is good, greasy, standard fare. The chips were good, but again, drenched in grease. If you're into that, okay. Nothing was remotely spicy and all the sauces felt like they were missing something, and again, greasy as hell. You're going to pay for going to this place in a gastrointestinal sense. What goes in must come out, one way or another...

I'm not really sure what the hubbub is about this place. Seems pretty standard and mediocre to me. I might try another location just to see if it's moderately better there, because this location is seriously gross - general gas station ambience, unclean tables, a grotty trash can right next to the cash register. I wanted to smother myself in hand sanitizer after I left.

Is this what passes for Mexican cuisine in Vegas?? I've got to find something better."	2	Robertos Taco Shop	3.5
Excellent food!!! And excellent service from Verona at the counter. I live near Nellis Air Force Base and I travel all the way here for great healthy food! I highly recommend them to all!!! I also recommend the kefta and ground chicken. Yummmmmy!!!!! :)	5	Shawarma Plus	4
SO GOOD. I went here with a larger family party. We had amazing service, delicious food, and a great time. While I just ordered some simple enchiladas, they were well-prepared, delicious, etc and other members of the party ordered tamales and other dishes & reported they were great. I really enjoyed the salsa and I thought the guacamole was good verging on so-so. Will definitely be back, this is the place to be when you want good food and good service.	5	Dona Maria Tamales Restaurant	3.5
"I really enjoyed this place! I ordered a cheeseburger with sweet potato fries and it was DELICIOUS. My date ordered a chicken burger (she has a stomach ulcer so super greasy beef is a no-no) and the rosemary fries. OH MY GOD, the rosemary fries were AMAZING! I couldn't stop stealing food from her. Next time I'll definitely order that. I want to try their shakes as well and all their salads looked delicious. 

I usually feel sick after a greasy meal like this but I actually felt pretty great - I think their quality is much higher than elsewhere and for a pretty affordable price. The portion sizes they give you are also more realistic than other places that give you heaping mounds of food that will probably kill you.

They're definitely going for a bit of a more upscale feeling - waiters bus your tray and the manager asks if you liked your meal, etc. Unusual for a burger joint. Service was prompt but the energy behind it didn't feel very genuine - they seemed a little sad. Maybe because there's not much of an opportunity to tip in a place like this...? Even though the employees clearly deserve it."	4	Smashburger	3.5
I've ordered takeout from them several times and it's always delicious. We always get white pizza and it's SO SO SO good here. I'm not usually into white pizza but what they make is spectacular. I'm not into their garlic knots though - to be honest, it just seemed like bread to me. Delivery is prompt & good.	4	North End Pizza	3
This place is solid. Every time I've been here the service has been good and the food has been quick to arrive. Is it weird that I really like the decor?! I don't know, some vague Southern part of me is into it. I usually order the ribs and they are delicious, filling, and well-seasoned. The variety of sauces offered at the tables is awesome. There are also wipes right at the table.	4	Famous Dave's Barbeque - Las Vegas	3
"I'm beginning to see that the bar is extremely low for Las Vegas sushi. This sushi was alright, just not stellar. We ordered an avocado rolls, spicy tuna roll, two spicy tuna crunch rolls, and some special roll I can't remember the name of - perhaps a Green Dragon? Anyhow it was spicy tuna and avocado. Overall I felt as though the sushi was fine, well prepared and organized, and the waitstaff were polite. However, the tuna itself was not very delicious, I don't think it was particularly spicy, and the sauces used on some of the rolls were unusual - the spicy mayo tasted vaguely fruity, like mango or something?? In addition the crunchy spicy tuna roll was just a tuna roll with crunchy thrown on top of it, not a style I have seen in the past and not one I enjoyed. Overall everything was fine but not actually good.

The portions were generous. We over-ordered, so keep in mind that the rolls will most likely be bigger than you expect."	2	Yummy Grill & Sushi	4.5
"Like a moth to a flame, I return to the overpriced Sushi Loca. I thought maybe I had been in a bad mood my last visit, or ordered the wrong items - wishful thinking. 

This time I ordered some simple rolls, spicy tuna and regular tuna. With miso soup and a tempura appetizer to split with my date, the total came out to something absurd like $50 for what amounted to 2 1\/2 rolls each. Highway robbery. 

I cannot believe this passes for ""good"" sushi in Las Vegas, or all the five star reviews on here. DEAR GOD, smell the tuna my friends. Your tuna should not smell so bad\/fishy or taste so unappetizing. It was edible but certainly not fresh or enjoyable. They also charge per drink on soda (no refill). AVOID."	1	Sushi Loca	3.5
"I don't know how anyone can go to a place like IHOP or Denny's voluntarily when they could go to The Cracked Egg. My girlfriend and I had had the worst night of our lives, our dog was in a veterinary hospital overnight sick - we didn't get much sleep (there was a lot of weeping involved). We woke up, knowing we would pick him up at noon and thought - goddamn it, I deserve a good breakfast after all this! And the Cracked Egg is that kind of place. This is food and service that could mend you, body and soul...

I ordered their croissant sandwich and my date ordered an omelette with bacon, cheese, and avocado (the serving of avocado was very generous - for those wondering). We both opted for hash browns. The hash browns here are WAY better fare than you would get elsewhere, although they are greasy to a fault. Still, it's like IHOP hash browns on steroids. These hash browns would make IHOP hash browns pee their pants in fear. It reminded me of something my grandma from Oklahoma would pull out in the morning, made in a skillet - low on presentation, high on deliciousness and love.

The wait was manageable if you're an early riser, service was extremely prompt. We received several offers of more coffee, water, milk etc, were asked if everything was good, from many different waiters and our main waiter was smiling, happy, and clearly a kind guy.

We ended up spending $30, around $15 per person for three drinks and two HUGE platters of food. For the quality and service (and the fact that you're supporting a smaller business) it's worth it."	5	The Cracked Egg	3.5
"My family and I went here earlier today. My mom is allergic to my cat (oops) and can't stay in the apartment for over 30 mins, so I couldn't cook her the elaborate Thanksgiving meal we had hoped for. Thankfully, Shuck's was open and they even had a special menu for the day and $1 oyster specials. The waitresses were SO sweet and kind. I kind of felt like the devil for going to a restaurant on Thanksgiving day but if I had to, I think Shuck's was the best choice.

The Thanksgiving menu was pretty generous, for $11 you got a ton of food and a piece of pie (pecan or pumpkin). The food was solid\/good, I'd say their seafood is better than their Thanksgiving fare. Regardless, the fact that they were even open made me super, super grateful, because I don't know what else we would have done!"	5	Shucks Tavern & Oyster Bar	3.5
"The burgers were average, huge and relatively satisfying. I'm not a major fan of steak fries but they were good too. Service was mediocre. I'm not sure why but we always had to ask to have the fries refilled. I thought it was bottomless, it's kind of uncomfortable to continually have to ask your server three or four times to get your money's worth.

Sidenote, but it was through the greasy deliciousness of Red Robin that my girlfriend finally found out she had a stomach ulcer. The night after we ate it she ended up in the ER with intense stomach pain. Bottomless steak fries aren't messing around, people! I'm not sure we'll be back anytime soon, given her affliction!!"	4	Red Robin Gourmet Burgers	3.5
Very solid food. The naan was delicious, and service was excellent. Good atmosphere for a weekend night. The main dishes were very good and they offer a "spiciness" level for almost every dish. I consider myself relatively good with spice (for a white girl raised on peanut butter sandwiches, I should add) but I overestimated myself here.	4	Saffron Flavors of India	4
I come back to this Chipotle just for the convenience factor and because I F***ING LOVE CHIPOTLE (and so does my gf). The people who work here are super sweet & kind. Only criticisms: steak is not well-cooked enough, guacamole is WAY too chunky (as compared to other Chipotles). I wonder if someone who works there (manager or something???) prefers their steak rare and their guacamole chunky. I'm not super into it but I'll bear it for the convenience of a Chipotle two feet from my apartment with good, kind service.	4	Chipotle Mexican Grill	3
"It's funny that this place is named ""On the Border"" because it's right on the border of mediocre and actually bad food. Just in between there. Not offensive, just not actually good, either.

Lunch specials are priced right - $8.99 for two items or $9.99 for three. Portions are generous. Chips and salsa are underwhelming, and the salsa gives a slow burn that almost seems authentic (but again, not quite). I ordered Caesar salad, a tostada, and an enchilada. 

The Caesar salad was BAD. Because this placed seemed like a weird Mexican version of Applebee's, I expected a very generic Caesar. Instead I got some weird, flavorless Caesar-flavored vinaigrette with wilted lettuce and no croutons. NOPE. I put it aside after a few bites and notably received no questions from the servers. Normally when you don't do more than touch something you order, a server displays some worry. ""Did you not enjoy that? Is something wrong? Is there anything I can do to fix it?"" I don't even care that they're not going to do anything, it's the gesture that counts. 

Both the tostada and the enchilada were alright, but very flavorless and underwhelming - pouring salsa on them helped, but not much. The meat was either bad quality or incredibly poorly cooked (maybe even burned a little). Not into it. Beans and rice were fine but nothing special.

The one thing I will say that's positive about this place: they have a great interior designer. Whoever put together the decor in that place has a real eye for it. It's very nice looking and probably draws in way more customers than the food. They also have a huge flatscreen so you can watch the game while you eat your mediocre, bland food."	2	On The Border Mexican Grill & Cantina	3
"As far as I know there aren't any Paneras in Northwest Las Vegas so I always run over to Lake Mead (a bit of a drive). Most often I am dragged there by my girlfriend who LOVES Panera and is obsessed with their lemon orzo soup. I have to say that the food is worth the drive and the price for the quality you get, I have never had a bad dish at any Panera. 

I went in recently to pick up food for my girlfriend, who was distraught after having a tough day at work. I ordered the customary lemon orzo soup, all was well, but then the manager came out nicely to explain to me (after the order was placed) that they have discontinued that soup completely. ""Forever?"" I gasped with the air of a fainting maiden. ""It's my girlfriend's favorite!!"" He was (kindly) caring about the whole thing as I struggled to think of something different to order for her. Imagine my surprise when he comped me the soup completely and insisted on refunding the $$ for it and still gave me a different type of soup for free. Please note, I didn't ask for this and actually tried to press the refunded cash back into his hands, but he insisted. To me that was ABOVE AND BEYOND customer service. Despite their lack of lemon orzo soup, I will probably return again."	5	Panera Bread	3.5
Well I got the bread bowl.  it was semi ok chowder in a bread bowl... came with a fork. Guess that foreshadowing for that the chower will be be thick enough to eat with a fork. ... but it was wrong.  It wasn't bad tho	3	Ruby's Diner	2.5
"Visited in early August 2016. We had a buy 1, get 1 pass for dinner and went early to try to avoid a huge line (the line was still pretty slow-moving, but wasn't massive). 
The food was really good-- just what I expected from a Vegas buffet! The prime rib was excellent. The ""Kobe"" beef was a little off in flavor (I've had it in Kobe, and this didn't taste like that), but still delicious. The sushi, despite so many warnings against sushi on Vegas buffets, was delicious. The desserts were absolutely amazing. I couldn't choose and just ended up getting one of almost every kind! The crab was tasty but I missed having a butter dipping sauce for sure. 
The Buffet loses a star for service. The staff at the registers where you prepay weren't very hospitable and we were slow to get drinks from the wait staff (they were very friendly though)."	4	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
"Visited early August 2016. 
We came for breakfast with the $20 coupon from the Lettuce Entertain You coupon book, had no problems using it. I got a blueberry parfait (servicable but nothing to write home about) and my friend got a three-egg breakfast plate. She absolutely loved her plate, and there was enough to share. The thick-cut, perfectly cooked bacon forever raised my standards for what constitutes good bacon! 
The staff were great-- we needed about 10 refills on our coffee and they were quick and attentive. The view was very nice: we could see the Bellagio fountains but there wasn't really much going on that early in the morning. 
Overall it was a very good experience!"	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"I love this place. The last two times my husband and I were in Vegas, we stayed in the Downtown area. A good friend working on the strip recommended this restaurant. A block away from the Fremont Street Experience, you get away from the crowds to enjoy great food, atmosphere and fun. 

The first time we went in August, the managers noticed we were new and introduced themselves. I was under the impression the restaurant itself was new as this is a tactic you see when new places open. Not the case here. Triple George has been around awhile and the managers always try to notice who walks in the door! 

As self-proclaimed fanatics and my own twenty plus years in the biz, we love sitting near the kitchen to get the feel of the place, see the flow, enjoy the way the restaurant and staff make the flow happen for all the guests. I was certainly NOT disappointed. From our vantage point, we could see into the kitchen, around the large bar\/ lounger area and into the dining area. We were treated to an entire evening of attentive service, excellent cocktails, fabulous food, near perfect timing, and the joy of watching truly seasoned staff in their element of harmony & flow through out. 

We started off the evening with martinis - shaken to the point of the ice chips floating on top and made to our specs - barely a hint of vermouth and for me the slightest bit dirty. Not being a huge martini drinker, this was very good and very well done. We chose the goat cheese\/ marinara appetizer. This was very tasty and the accompanied bread was toasted nicely. The only complaint on this I would have is it is really too big for just two people. The goat cheese was warmed just enough to spread onto the bread. We could have had this as our dinner. Each of us had salads. Being a bay area organics snob, I am always leery of the freshness of produce in other parts of the country. Here I was not disappointed. Each salad - iceberg wedge and Cesar, were fresh and crisp, definitely not day old produce here! Bacon bits on the iceberg wedge were not processed but made in house as was the blue cheese dressing - not heavy creamy, but complimented the blue cheese in the dressing. The dressing for the cesar was also fresh made in house - not overly salty as I find many to be. 

The main dishes were great - rack of lamb and the special of the evening. I cannot remember the exact name of the special from back in August. If I do I will certainly update. The temperature on the rack of lamb was perfect - medium rare. The cut was definitely high quality as the flavor was excellent with no gamieness to it at all. The accompanying potato and vegetables were very tasty and not over seasoned at all. The special of the evening was a stew of three meats - lamb shank, beef, and pork. The stew was a coq au vin style with onions, carrots, potatoes and mushrooms in a dark wine sauce\/ stew. The meats fell off the bones and were so tender and delicious! Again, huge portions of food but very tasty.

I will always make it a point to go to this place when we are in Vegas!"	5	Triple George Grill	4
"Whenever I go to Vegas.. I go to Eaaarl of Sandwich. First off, this place is 24 hours so you're BOUND to come here after your ""late night out"". But honestly, esp coming here late at night.. the sandwiches are delish. And no it's not the ""drunchies"" that's making me say this because I've eaten at Earls during the day as well. Their sandwich portions aren't that big though so you can defs finish a whole sandwich on your own if you're super hungry. Other than that, the prices are okay too. Only thing is.. lines might be kind of long since this place is super popular (could also be hard to find a seat). 

The sandwiches are perfectly toasted, with just the right amount of everything. Oh, and you can't forget the Grey Poupon (sp?)! But yeee this place is a must go for a good, affordable meal in Vegas!"	5	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
The food is GOOOOOOOD!!!! I'm thoroughly impressed with the portion sizes, and of course, THE TASTE!!!! The staff was nice and cordial...Great Job guys!!! :)	4	Southern Style Eatery	4
The food was brought out very fast, drinks were refilled promptly, and we even got two free margaritas by checking in! I thoroughly enjoyed the food. A+	5	Nacho Daddy Downtown	4
Border Grill has always been my go to when I am at this mall, but this visit tops them all. Ross, Brandon, Alan, and Ciara helped us explore new items on the menu and wow I've been ordering the wrong things for years! We had the Border Classics, Chicken Poblano Enchiladas and the Black Bean and Corn Esquite Salad. All amazing dishes. Very amazing service. Would recommend to all.	5	Border Grill	4.5
the food was excelnt marina was a great friendly waitress and the food was out of this world the chips and drinks ware great and the restaurant was clean it has a home away from home kind of feeling.....	5	Centro America Restaurant	3.5
Go to Outback Steakhouse, it's just down the street and the service and food are way better.	1	Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar	2.5
But everytime I go there they are closed. :( All the furniture and everything is still inside. They have the best street tacos. I'm really sad.	5	Cilantro Tacos	4
I ordered the mac n cheese,  a house salad,  and a Newcastle Brown. The girl that I ordered from was a little wierd. I said I wanted a beer or wine recommendation and she recommended I come back on Wednesday when they're half price. Lol. She didn't have a name tag. My food came immediately. The cheese in the mac tasted wierd to me, the salad had a lot of dressing. The salad was good.  A staff member asked how my food was. I expressed my opinion about the food, a manager came out, talked to me about my food and refunded the price of the mac even though I'd consumed most of it.  I look forward to coming back and trying something else. I was very impressed with the service. I'll re-review when I come back to try something else.	5	Mac Shack	3.5
"Some friends came to Vegas and wanted to go to Mesa.  It was kind of last minute, and since it was Saturday night, I figured I better call and make a reservation.  They put us down for 6:00.  Of course, the traffic was horrible, so I called back and asked if we could change our reservation.  They informed me that since I didn't secure our reservation with a credit card that we, in fact, didn't have one.  The person I spoke with on the phone was not helpful and very rude. She proceeded to argue with me about whether or not I had a reservation till finally I asked if I could just, please, make one.  I made the new reservation for 6:30 and she let me off the phone without a credit card.  Then when we arrived at the restaurant the Hostess, rudely, told me that we didn't have a reservation, she was adamant about this, till I pointed at my name, written down on her sheet next to ""6:30"".

I had a beer (corona or tecate?), the Lobster Tacos (appetizer), and the sesame crusted ahi.  It was alright.  The portions were very small.  My daughter had a cheese quesadilla and milk.  The bill for just myself and my daughter came out to $100.

The service was good but there wasn't a lot to it."	2	Mesa Grill	4
"I'm giving this place four stars because usually it's good.  Tonight it wasn't so great. We came in,  the place was empty,  the person at the counter didn't greet us, she just stood there staring at the mat on the counter that displayed some food and messed with it.

 After a few minutes we asked if we could order,  she mumbled something. I asked which was better,  carne asada or carnitas, she said they were both good. I asked which was better,  Jessica was tight lipped, and refused to voice a preference.

I wanted to go to Hussongs. My daughter chose this. They have Dos Eqis Amber, which I love.  Joshua was pleasant when delivering the food,  the bartender was quick with my beer, and happy to give me a chilled glass. The food is good. Once we cleanser ourselves of the negativity we experienced while ordering,  all will be fine."	4	Wahoo's Fish Tacos	3.5
15 min. Wait for a table for 2 on Tuesday at lunch, standing room only to wait, if you ask for the wifi password someone will say, snotty, "it's private". It's like going back in time,  hopefully you don't need to get any work done!	3	Eat.	4

"*No one wears gloves here* I came here the evening of Friday Nov. 21, to get some pizza, fast. I asked the girl at the register How much a large cheese pizza is.  She said ""That'll be $12.92"". I asked how much 2 medium cheese pizzas are,  she said ""$12.95"". I ordered the two pizzas, paid, and said I'd be back. The girl at the register told me it would be 15-20 minutes.
  I returned to a line of two people, less than 15 minutes later. I waited in the line for over 10 minutes, staring at my pizzas that were waiting on the shelf for me. As I was waiting, I watched an employee, a girl in a green apron, placing parchment in the box, where she was about to place the pizza, she pressed, with here bare hand, down on the middle of the paper, then placed a pizza someone was going to eat right on top. I looked at the other employees in the kitchen,  one was on the back of the oven, not gloved and another working in the kitchen, also not gloved. Of the four employees working there, zero wore gloves.
When I got to the front of the line the girl asked what she could do for me. The restaurant wasn't that busy,  I feel like she should've remembered me. It was very irritating to wait in line for paid for pizzas.
The pizza was average. None of us have the stomach flu yet."	1	Beach St. Pizza	3
"Great food! Great prices and fantastic staff. Props to them for making us a feel like we were the only customers there! 

The brisket is amazing and the tables were cleaned quickly after a party left so that we could be seated quickly !! 

It was so good I'm going to be coming back!"	5	Tofu Hut	3.5
Well we stopped here for a quick breakfast bite. I ordered smoked salmon and cream cheese crepe and my husband got breakfast croissant. My crepe was absolutely delicious! My husbands croissant was cold and cheese wasn't even melted... So it's really I guess more of a crepe place and dessert	4	Espressamente illy	3.5
"I stayed here for 2 nights in a PETITE KING room. The room was small.... the width was basically the size of the king bed plus a nightstand on each side. There was also NO mini-fridge... not sure if I've ever stayed at a hotel without a mini fridge. The room was also super dark at all times because there was basically no window (the window was like a port hole on a cruise) and the lighting was dark. 

Now for the rest of the hotel: the casino is moderate size, not too big; not many shops to walk around for, and not as many restaurant options as other hotels. What I was most upset about was that they TOOK AWAY THE LIONS. I always come see the lions when I visit Vegas and the only time I stay at the MGM, they're gone! (replaced it with The Rain Forest Cafe!) The location of the hotel is also at the farther end of the strip.

My favorite thing about the MGM was the lazy river and the pool ($16 to rent a tube but $10 to buy)"	3	MGM Grand Hotel	3
WOW WOW WOW!!!!  This place is amazing!  We took friends there to celebrate a birthday and it was SPECTACULAR!  Every course is a piece of art on a plate.  One of our guests was a serious foodie and she was in heaven!  The service was like a perfect dance with impeccable timing.  This is a special place for special occasions. We will be back!	5	Joël  Robuchon	4.5
Treasure in Summerlin!  Cozy atmosphere.  Authentic Thai cuisine served by very friendly staff.  Thursday night is half of wine bottle night.  The menu is extensive enough that you can eat there regularly and always have something different.  They did this place right!	5	Nittaya's Secret Kitchen	4.5
Fantastic!!!!  The atmosphere is fun yet relaxed, the food is delicious and service is impeccable.  Will be back for sure!	5	Honey Salt	4
We were turned on to this restaurant by a Chinese Restaurateur from San Francisco.  It did not disappoint!  Food was clean and very authentic.  Great service, nice atmosphere.  If your in Vegas and want quality Chinese food, this is the place!	5	Joyful House Chinese Cuisine	3.5
Since I'm on here yelping, I should give Red Velvet a shout out.  I found them in a Veg directory and my husband and I are long-time regulars.  We've been coming here as long as I can remember (we moved here in 2009).  The chopped Salad is the best.  This is the only place I'll buy take home deserts and cookies.	5	Red Velvet Cafe	3.5
I've just moved back to Vegas (again!) and was looking for Red Velvet Cafe.  I was sad to see it's gone but Eatt moved into the same strip mall so I thought I'd give it a try.  It's fabulous and the owners and staff are all very enthusiastic.  I've been twice by myself and then brought my husband, who loved it as well.  It's Euro portioning, which is just perfect for me since I can't shake that very unhealthy "clean your plate" mentality.  So if you're a big eater, like my husband, you might want to try a few things.  It's not expensive, so not a big deal that the portions aren't huge.  They did a great job with clean and casual decor.	5	Eatt Gourmet Bistro	4.5
The staff does not have much regard for health code procedures.  Both the food server and the expediter continuously touch their hair and face and then everyone's  food (that's how you get people sick!!!). I even saw a bus girl with green\/black hair actually flip her ponytail into clean beverage glasses then proceed to put them on the table anyway, with her fingers inside the clean glasses.  No beard nets or hats on cooks.  Manager drinking and eating in the food prep area.  Food trendy and mediocre.  Nothing special here.	1	Honey Salt	4
"I can definitely see why Vic & Anthony's is one of the top steakhouses in America. The food was amazing.
I had the 12 oz. filet and I can say it was one of the best I have ever had. I usually need steak sauce but not for this one!
I also recommend getting the asparagus and mash potatoes."	5	Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse	4.5
I ate here a couple weeks ago, per my cousin's recommendation for good sushi off The Strip and this place didn't disappoint.  We came for AYCE lunch sushi and everything was very good and fresh. You can request half orders of most of the rolls on the menu which was great bc we were able to try many different rolls. Of all the things we ordered (too many to list and I can't remember them all now), I really liked the hamachi kama, baked lobster and dragon rolls, and garlic tuna and ocean trout nigiri.	5	Sakana	4
I had Lobster tacos to start- they were delicious!  Tried the flatbread and it was great too.  You could make a meal out of the appetizers!  The service was excellent and so was all the food.  The manager stopped by the table to check on us which I thought was very professional of him.  Definitely will be back!	5	FIX	3.5
I love anything with the jalapeno bacon!  Yum.  Also the shrimp and chorizo appetizer is good.  Very, very , very noisy.  Don't try to have a business conversation.  Owner nice and always there.  Too bad they are closing in October.	4	DW Bistro	4.5
Can I give less than 1 star?  No one seems to care about Heath code regulations and not getting people sick- especially the manager!  I watched the hostess packing up my take out food, assembling the items and licking her fingers after touching my food!  Sooo disguising.  Hand washing?  Nope.  And guess what?   The manager is just as bad because she didn't care.  Naked Fish is ten times better sushi anyway.	1	Kona Grill	3.5
Why is it ok for waiters to lean on your tablecloth and put their elbows on your table while taking your order?  If I wanted TGIFridays, I would go there and expect zero professionalism!  I expected a higher level of service at the Palm. Also why does every single waiter carry your glasses by the rim where your lips go and not professionally by the stem or at the bottom?  Why did the condiments, bibs and side dishes come so far after the entrée at the lobster was actually cool before I receive my lemon, butter and bib?  The lack of professional training here is shocking.	2	The Palm Las Vegas	4
In my opinion, it has gone downhill since the new location opened at DTS.  I have been getting the penne a la vodka for over 10 years, and it just is not good anymore.  Also the staff is lax.  The baked brie is always good as is the wine selection though.  Maybe just for happy hour brie and wine I would go 4.5 stars.	2	Grape Vine Cafe	4
Nothing special.  They allowed a purse dog to sit on a booth next to me (not a service dog and kind of gross)  so they obviously do not care about health code violations.  Makes me worry about the kitchen.	3	Andiron Steak & Sea	4
We LOVED the Omelet House!!! We can't pay the prices of meals on the Strip, so heard of the Omelet House and had our two breakfasts here. Prices are amazing - the average 2 eggs, bacon, potatoes, bread of choice was like $5.95. Yes! And their potatoes are homecooked and crispy - almost like potato chips. Their bacon is done just right, crispy and lots of it.  All their plates of food are large and with the breakfast comes a choice of banana or pumpkin bread. The place is large, with room after room filled with locals. Both times we went there during the week the place was packed. We'd be here weekly if we lived in Vegas. Which, thank god, we do not.	4	Omelet House	4.5
"We ended up in Captial Seafood Restaurant as we were looking for Pho Vietnam. It's crazy confusing as both signs are lit up all big above this restaurant area. Once in the door they have a stack of menus for both restaurants. They then ask you which one you want. We looked around and everyone was eating Seafood, so we punted and went with the Seafood. 

Everyone around us were locals. The prices were great and the food was pretty good. Actually two of the dishes we had were great: bok choy with mushrooms and salt & pepper squid. Both cooked perfectly - not overcooked and really flavorful. We also got the crab appetizer - which was a special. That dish was so bad that neither of us could eat it. It was cooked so long that you could even bite all the way through the pieces. And it had a sauce that was totally funky.

All together though - for the prices and the majority of great food AND the amount of locals that were obviously enjoying themselves and had spreads on their table that looked delicious: we would come back for sure."	3	Capital Seafood Restaurant	3.5
"I.Just.Love.This.Place. I've been going here for probably 5 years now, if not more. They are consistently good. It's worth the drive from Boulder City (where I live) if that tell you anything!

Produce on salads and gyros is fresh, as is the meat - always well seasoned and cooked well. I've tried several things here, Spanakopita is fresh, truly made by hand (no pre boxed frozen stuff here). Fries are perfectly cooked and it's worth the upgrade to Greek fries. Feta cheese on salads and fries is creamy and tangy. Pitas are soft and delicious, and the gyros are made with generous portions. Sauces are delicious! The Baklava is made daily, SUPER fresh, warm, and the perfect balance of sweetness with the richness of the pastry and nuts. One word of warning, they do not serve pitted olives so watch your teeth! 

The staff are attentive and fast. This is a true family owned business and I see the owner and his son working their butts off every time I'm in. The eating areas are kept clean, and there's lots of natural light coming in and a nice outdoor patio area if you like. For what you get, the price is very reasonable."	5	Yassou	4.5
We had a good breakfast here, I had smoked salmon bagel, my hubby had waffle and eggs. Everything taste good, they even had soy milk for my coffee! It was a bit pricey for what we had.	4	Solaro	2.5

"I've been here twice now for lunch. Ordered the lentil soup and Mediterranean salad the first time and the Greek salad with chicken the next. Others in my party ordered the chicken kebob lunch specials and a gyro and they looked fantastic. 

The lentil soup is different than what I'm used to (more blended consistency) but flavor was great. Both times the salads were lovely - fresh and flavorful. The herb balance with the Mediterranean salad was a standout. Chicken was tender and had good spice blends on it. I think probably the worst thing was the pita. Both times it was thin and dry, maybe over-warmed? Hummus didn't have as strong of a flavor as I'm used to, but maybe I'm just used to over-salted store bought stuff. 

Service was great both times. Wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable about most items on the menu. It's not THE best Mediterranean I've had, but it's certainly the best within a mile or two from my work. I'll be back. The quality and experience is worth the (reasonable) price."	3	Maza Mediterranean Grill & Lounge	4
Exquisite food, superb service.  Celebrated mom's bday.  Reservation staff were accommodating and made suggestions on seating  to make this memorable.  Gracious greeting with happy bday wishes.  Waiter was professional, attentive, knowledgeable!  Best drink- raspberry limonato!  Succulent Osso bucco with perfect risotto!  Definitely a wonderful dining experience	5	Sinatra	4
Extremely disappointing service.  The 2 girls who are the hostesses had very poor customer service skills and  they wer both ugly to boot - Friday, Sept 2nd.  Had a reservation and wanted a table by the rails and they ship us to timbuktu and when I asked for a closer table so that we can see more of hte "square" they acted as though this was the greatest incovenience.  And to punish us, took 20 minutes to set this up and all others were booked.  then the bus boy was stupid and we did not get our bread until 10 minutes into the meal when our salad was being served.  The food was great and reasonable but the by the glass wine selections were very poor and over priced.  But these 2 ugly girls should be fired for their very poor service - not a great first impression for this restaurant - one star is even over-rated - should have zero stars.	1	Otto Enoteca Pizzeria	3.5
Not the same stellar experience compared to Miami!  Poor cust svce- reservations girl did not indicate that there is an outdoor place in mall area!  Dining rm was old, dirty and noisy grim kitchen and wait staff.  Waiter was condescending, inattentive! Stone crabs were not cracked properly like Miami!  Overpriced and poor svce- if want steaks go to SW, Delmonicos, Morton's !  Do not go here	1	Joes Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab	4.5
This is a nice place to eat and it's just off the strip by the big wheel in the sky and near the Flamingo. It is old, quaint, and famous. You'll see celebrity pics and autographs on the wall. The service is very good, the atmosphere is nice (it's dark in there), and the food is good. My lady really enjoyed their red sauce and garlic bread. It's a little pricey but you will get all of the red and white wine you can drink. I'd recommend coming here for sure at least once. Oh, you get a very tasty cappuccino after dinner and I loved the flavor of it!	4	Battista's Hole In the Wall	3.5
"Won't ever go back.  Poor service and mediocre (at best) hamburgers.  It took forever to get the waitress out of a conversation with the bartender so that we could order drinks.  The food arrived promptly, but was simply a hamburger on a plate.  No garnish, pickle, nothing!  The bun was lifeless and looked like a mass produced bun from the grocery store.  Burger was only barely warm.  
I would have offered feedback at the time, but nobody was around that seemed to care."	1	B&B Burger & Beer	3
Awe and I forgot about our appetizer Main Crab & lobster with avocado and horseradish sauce was absolutely by far my favorite! It was such a great combination of dancing flavors in my mouth! And surely the onion bread I can eat all day everyday!	5	CUT by Wolfgang Puck	4
"It has been a tradition among our group of friends to go out for a good steak one evening during our annual Interbike trip. In the years past I would have easily given this a five star rating.  Not so much this time.  

We had reservations for five people and were promptly seated at a table that should have been used by four even though there were empty tables around the place.  The service was fine and I cannot fault the wait staff in any way.  

We started with drinks of course, Makers on the rocks. For twelve dollars in a town that throws alcohol at you, you would expect a decent pour.  The drinks were heavy on the ice and very light on the Makers Mark.  I have had more generous pours while playing nickel slots. 

The big disappointment was the steak. Four of the five had us had steak, mine was a bone in rib eye which while cooked correctly, medium rare, was dry and tough.  All of the steak eaters at the table had similar experiences and two were served cold mashed potatoes. 

As a group, we didn't discuss our impressions of the meal until after leaving the table.  We all thought that our experiences and concerns were unique and did not want to ruin anyone else's dinner by complaining, but after leaving we compared notes. At that point, one member of the party returned to speak to the management.  To be honest they did not seem that concerned. 

This was once a great steakhouse, and worth the money. For my money, next time, I'll be going elsewhere."	3	THE Steak House	4
"Yes! Go here when you want good food at a chill spot in the middle of Vegas. Europeans say the best way to fight a hangover is to eat greasy foods! Well, I dont get drunk enough to have hangovers, nor do I agree with everything Europeans say... nor is Hash House that greasy, so I have no idea why I said that. Onto the review.

Food - Bomb dot com

Portions, ambiance, prices and whatever else doesnt even matter with the above said food description. Well, 1 star off because of the price and inconvenient locations (i.e. they need more locations, specifically in San Gabriel Valley where I live).

I guess all that's left to talk about is the customer service. It's an American restaurant, not an Asian mom and pop, so comparably, I'd say it was pretty awesome. 'nough said."	3	Hash House A Go Go	4

"Japanese fried skewers, Tempura, pressed box sushi, and rice.....
An excellent ethnic dining experience not to be missed. 
There might be another Kushi Age restaurant in maybe..  Los Angeles. 
Other then that your not going to find anything like this here in the USA 
Very traditional method of cooking various things in very hot oil that have been coated with freash made Panko flakes. In Japan a Kushi Age place would be very small and probably very old. At Yu Yu's you find the familiar feel of a Sushi restaurant.  Of course, the food is very different. items are served in small quantities of usually  two skewers for each item ordered. You can let the Chef make all of the decisions by ordering the chef's choice. All of the different types of chicken skewers were excellent with good quality chicken and expert prep. the various vegetables available were interesting and very fresh. Expertly cooked. A wide range of sauces and seasoned salts were also very good.. The skewers came out at a nice pace that lets you enjoy each flavor without having to rush for fear of some of the food getting cold.. They also do some sashimi, noodles, Katsu Don, and another thing very hard to find in the US..  Battera..  japanese pressed box sushi 
Worth a try if you love Japanese food as much as I do !!
experiment and put the time in to find what you like.
You will be rewarded with a great experience and become a fan of skewers too.."	5	Yu-Yu	4.5
"Excellent choice for Izakaya in Vegas
open late"	4	Izakaya Go	4.5
Not worth it!  The eggs Benedict was good tasting, but cold!  All the other food was very bland.  They need to focus on quality and not quantity!!!  Too many selections of bland food!	2	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
I'm not a local, but I found this place as it was recommended by a buddy. It's a little ways off the strip, but totally worth the venture. Portions are very good, and quality of food was excellent. Service was above expectations.  Each person I encountered seemed very concerned with my groups experience. All of us enjoyed our meals. Between us we have chips\/salsa\/bean dip, soups, chile Colorado, fajitas (chicken and steak), and some really yummy looking tacos.  I tried both, the corn and flour tortillas with the meal and they were also a good compliment. I didn't drink as I went for lunch so unfortunately I wasn't able to rate the margaritas.  Highly recommended.	5	Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina	4.5
"Okay. So a bit disappointed in my visit, especially after all the rave I hear on the joint. The service was top notch. We had reservations at got seated within a few minutes.  Each person from host, wait staff, and manager were all very nice and professional. We definitely felt as we were attended to. (4.4\/5)
The problem and deduction in rating was the food, unfortunately.  We each ordered the filet, medium well, and we ordered two sides to share. The filets came out sizzling hot and looked and smelled so good.  We cut into each and we noticed a huge difference. One was pretty red, and mine was, well, brown.  It was still edible and it is hard for me to send food back to any kitchen (we all know why there is anxiety sending food back.) when our waitress came back around I showed her the difference and she acknowledged that they were not cooked the same. She said it looked like one was underdone and the other a little over cooked. The manager did a round checking on tables as well. I let her know I was enjoying my meal, but did point out the difference.  She was surprised at the difference and offered to correct the mistake. I will admit, I did not ask for a correction.  But when we are paying $210 for two (2 filets, 2 sides total, and three glasses of wine total), it should really come out right the first time.  And since it didn't, a server or manager should try to make it right in another way as it should be known that some guests are not comfortable sending food back.  Maybe comp a slice of cake? Or not charge for one of the filets....just saying. Service was good good, food was blah, issue resolution skills could use some improvement. Unfortunately, at this price, I'm unsure to return."	3	Ruth's Chris Steak House	4
"Ummmm. I don't know what to say really. The burger was good. It was really good. But east versus west coast. My loyalty stays with in-n-out. 

But back to this place. Was super excited to check it out. I'm well aware of the hype and tried to make it here for a couple trips to Vegas. I walked over from cosmopolitan.  It was about a 15 min walk cutting thru some other hotels. The street may have been quicker, it was cold outside. I opted for secondhand cigarette smoke. I was thrown off by their burger logo outside.  The signage is all green. Then you walk in and see the signage inside features the green burger.  I waited in the quickly moving line but with anxiety. When it was my turn to order I had to ask, ""are the burgers green?""  I got a look back like I was being a smart-ass, but it was a legit concern in my mind. 

Back to the review. I ordered a cheeseburger , fries and a soda.  There were other options, but that's what I was feeling.  The wait was standard, 5 min'ish. The fries are crinkled fries. Reminded me of the frozen type mom would buy from grocery store.  Not a big deal to me as I'm not a big fry-guy any ways. The burger was really good. Had little tomatoes on them and some type of secret sauce.  It reminded me (taste and texture) of a Wendy's burger, but several notches higher in quality.  

It was a really good burger.  In and out is better, but this place is a lot quicker than any in-and-out."	4	Shake Shack	4
This is my go to place for 4am eats.  Prolly been here 30 times. It's perfect to order a sandwich and eat it on the way back to the room or to munch while at a slot machine.  It's kinda like my hangover insurance. This place is always open and the sandwich gets the job done.  The bad news is that they mess up my order more times than they don't.  Usually I'm drunk, so maybe(a small maybe) I have some blame to take--but i doubt it's ever my fault.  Anyways, try the Full Montagu.  I want to say it tastes great, but honestly....I can't remember.	4	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"I make a visit to Vegas 4 to 6 times a year and most visits I walk down to this joint which is located in the Linq.  As you can see in all the posted pictures, the place is unique and the lines are usually appropriately long.  If you are a Caesars Diamond player, you can always bypass this line for immediate seating. (One of the best perks. But I feel guilty for like...5 seconds, but then I immediately forget those waiting.)

I usually hit this spot as my breakfast.  It's good recovery food and prepare your tummy for ur next Vegas adventure.  I start with mimosas or this last time I tried the BLT Bloody Mary (which was bomb.). I hate paying for alcohol on Vegas so I never order more than two drinks here. 

Portions are HUGE...so I usually order just the basic eggs, sausage, toast and then I just eat off others plates --otherwise there is a bunch of wasted food.  We have tried Togo boxes, but in Vegas, there is sooooooo much food, who wants left overs?  I have also tried the corned beef hash--very good. But prefer cheddar instead of Swiss cheese.    

Service is good 
Food is good. 
Portions are generous. 
Atmosphere is fun

Pizza slices are pretty big.  Quality isn't anything special. Staff was rude and would call out the customers who didn't tip. Went because it was super late and most things were closed.  Should have had sandwich place inside PH.  There's a better pizza place at Cosmo.	2	Pin-Up Pizza	4

Everything was a hit but the meat. This could be a deal breaker for many, and at paying $200 it's understandable.  They will get another chance with me. Would recommend for someone to try."	4	Strip House Steak House	4
Food is really good. I enjoy getting guac, which they make table side to order.  Taquitos are good, tacos are bomb, and so are some other things....but I was too drunk to remember.  Recommend, yea. Return, yea.	4	YOLOS	3.5
"The line was very long. We went for Thursday brunch.  Luckily as a Caesars diamond player, we were able to bypass the line.  But we sat and figured we would order our drinks then adventure off.  Probably for 10 minutes  we sat there-- normally I'm patient, but I was a little hungover and needed a Bloody Mary...and there was a whole buffet at our finger tips!  Finally after putting our drinks in, we ventured off.  

The other reviews are pretty accurate about the variety and quality, but as a non-seafood fan...this place was not for me.  I thought I was safe on one of the salads, it had fruit in it.  But when I returned to table, I noticed the shrimp.  I'm not going to rant much about it....its just not for me. And for that reason 3 stars as ""OK"".

I will skip this one and hit up the wicked spoon at the Cosmo."	3	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"The best burger I have ever had is here in Vegas at Holsteins. It's on the second floor of the cosmo. Was probably my fourth visit.  We sat in the lounge each time. Super comfy seats. I got the Nom Nom burger which was Kobe beef, potato chips and thousand island. Yum!  Comes with excellent fries. Added a PBR ( don't judge ) and perfect. 

$45----
2 burgers with fries
2 drinks"	5	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4
"This restaurant is not bad by any means. I came to STK wanting to compare to other steakhouses I have visited on the strip.  My previous experiences of similar steakhouse include Ruth's Chris (Harrahs) and The Striphouse (Planet Hollywood).

My visit to STK was the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. It was busy and nearly impossible to get a reservation at a decent time. But we found a way, and got in at 8pm. It was packed. 

Me and my buddy were walked to our table and the immediate difference of STK to the other above mentioned was the environment.  There was loud music playing and the bar area was filled with people standing. Felt like a restaurant within a small club. 

The menu was similar to the other restaurants, with STK seemed a small percentage higher in price. Maybe because of its location in the Cosmopolitan. As me and my buddy enjoyed steaks at the competitors very much, we decided to order a comparable meal. Between us, we ordered the filet, sirloin, mashed potatoes and corn (actual names I do not remember; you can refer to menu).

Filet- tenderness 8\/10. Soft, but doesn't melt like Ruth's. Flavor 5\/10. Flavor was absent entirely. Appearance\/presentation 7\/10. Looked fine, but was not served hot, but rather warm. 

Sirloin- 8\/10 overall.  Was obviously not as tender as the filet, but it had much more flavor. This steak was good for a tougher steak of course. 

Mashed- good, but nothing spectacular. 
Corn- a bit too sweet and pasty for our taste. Maybe it's a preference thing, but seemed as it should be on dessert menu. My buddy wouldn't eat more than the first bite. 

Drinks were solid in taste. At just under $20\/drink I am happy this was spot on. Tried three different ones.  Don't remember all their names, Enjoyed the Cucumber stiletto. Sunset (tequila drink) and strawberry cobbler.  

Service. Everyone was friendly and delivery was quick. Took a bit to get our check with empty glasses, but they were slammed on MDW and wasn't much of an issue. 

Return? Not by choice; maybe if a friend insisted. Taste and quality goes to Ruth's."	3	STK Las Vegas	4
"I stayed at the Cosmo and had a F&B credit to use so we decided on trying the Wicked Spoon which is their buffet.  

Found a new ""best"".  Selection is decent enough as the quality of food is of what you'd expect for the quality hotel. Kung pao chicken was amazing. Never would have thought it was from a buffet.  The pizza was evenly amazing. Good cheese and was bubbling hot.  Got seconds on both.  

They also had some amazing fruit smoothies which tasted obviously fresh.  Helped to replenish vital nutrients lost the night before. 

2 of us for brunch and added the unlimited bloody Mary's, mimosas, and champagne $100.

And we went at 10am. No wait."	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
Sunrise coffee is a super cute and peaceful coffee shop although it can get a bit busy. The atmosphere of this place is overall a 5\/5 because the employees are super kind and friendly. The outdoors seating is what makes this place super cute. The reason I'm rating it a 3\/5 is because I'm not a huge fan of their iced coffee. But besides that I do recommend you stop by!	3	Sunrise Coffee	4.5
Mad House is definitely over hyped. The vibe here feels very high school-ish and their drinks are average. I had very high expectations for this place, but unfortunately its just another crazy looking coffee shop.	3	Mad House Coffee	4
My friend and I have been trying different coffee shops in town and so far, out of all the shops we've visited, PublicUs is our favorite! Their death cream iced coffee is my absolute favorite! To me, it's the perfect drink. The inside of this place is so hipster and the employees are so friendly. It's a great place to hangout with friends or study alone. Overall PublicUs is a 10\/10!!!	5	PublicUs	4.5
If you need a Lebanese food fix while in Vegas, this place is your best bet. Do yourself a favor and order something that comes with their piping hot, homemade pita bread. Give it a few minutes and let the loaves cool down; then dig in. You're welcome. Since every Lebanese person is an expert at critiquing Lebanese food (and basically everything else) you can trust me on this, you won't be disappointed. My wife gambled on the kafta and I placed my wager on the chicken shawerma sandwich. Both of them paid off big. Of COURSE I had some of her food, are you kidding me? Their rice is made just like mom makes it, and they're accurate with the amounts of spices, especially sumac. Did I mention the fresh, made to order pita bread? What're you waiting for?! We'll be back the next time we're in town.	5	Khoury's Mediterranean Restaurant	4
The house margaritas are really good. The carne asada nachos are really good. I also had the fajita salad with beef. The beef is a little salty for my taste. Next time I go I'm going to just stick to trying the different nachos they have. The atmosphere is sports bar and the employees are really nice.	4	Nacho Daddy Henderson	3.5
Tao Asion Bistro is a must from now on. A visit to Las Vegas is not complete until you dine at Tao. I went with a party of 5 and we all ordered different plates so we could share food and let's just say that we  were all extremely pleased. I don't even remember what we all ordered but it was all delicious. For around $30 a person you get excellent food and not your cookie cutter Chinese restaurant food, but extremely delicious food. The atmosphere of the restaurant is excellent, service was great, and the food was prepared quick. The day after we all went to the Bellagio Buffet which was more expensive than Tao and the food was nowhere near to Tao. Bellagio buffet was a waste of money. I would have rated Tao 5 stars but I was unhappy with the way we felt as if were being hurried to leave the place so the next party could sit.	4	TAO Asian Bistro	3.5
For a 5 star resort they DEFINITELY do not have a 5 star buffet. After hearing that this was the buffet to visit while in Vegas I decide to go with my wife and our friends to this buffet and experience the mother of all buffets. It was more like a over priced Home Town Buffet than a 5 star buffet. The made to order omelets were that same as the omelets you get at El Torito Sunday buffet, which are good. The prim rib was very disappointing, it tasted like boiled meat. This was the first time I had ever tried eggs Benedict and they were disgusting. I hate to throw away food, but I had to push my plate to the side and let our waitress take it. The rest of my party assured me that eggs Benedict tastes a lot better than what was being served at this buffet, I guess I will give them one more try at a different restaurant. Just about every item that I tried reminded me of cafeteria food and if I didn't try it it was because it wasn't very appealing. I would rate the dessert bar 4 stars, the dining area was extremely outdated and helped support my thinking of this place as a cafeteria. Not that there is anything wrong with cafeterias but for $32 a person I was expecting a lot better all around. The night before, we dined at Tao in the Venetian and the average was $30 a plate and I will rate them 5 stars as soon as I am done with this. I would definitely NOT recommend this buffet. Save your $32 and go to a way nicer place with way better food and atmosphere. The only reason I give them 2 stars is because they did have a wide variety of food.	2	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
"Props to my man Paul J... his review says it all:

""Absolute magic. 

The Fireside Lounge transforms a person. Sitting there drinking Jack Daniels while eating plate after plate of ribs served by beautiful women in long evening\/nightgowns all the while surrounded by fire and water and live concert videos, this is why America is, and will continue to be, the greatest country on earth!

There is simply nothing wrong with this place and everything right about it. if I could give it 10 stars I would, in fact, fuck it, I am. 10 stars."	5	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
Mediocre at best. Service was slow. Place was rammed, loud. Sushi was nothing special at all.	3	Yellowtail	3.5
Horrible service! Purchased on Groupon. The menu extremely over priced! Food was beyond mediocre! Lunch special has no specific days on menu! But don't allow it during the weekend even before 1pm. Nothing we order was good accept the spring rolls... & they were just ok... So lunch at 11:30am on a Saturday was 57$! Neverrrr again!	1	King & I	3.5
Came here for the lunch buffet which is $11.95\/person I believe. Buffet has extensive options and there is a full bar. The restaurant reminds me of one from India, especially walking up the stairs and through the hallways, but it does have a pretty cool view of the airport's runways. The staff was a little scatter-brained and the food wasn't being refilled on time, but it was very tasty nonetheless. It'd be better if they included more options, like more desserts and chai in their buffet, but all in all, we'll be back. Parking was a little difficult because the lot got full, so you may have to go to the lot below the building.	4	Pure Indian Cuisine	4.5
Came here for a big group lunch and thankfully we had a reservation--the place was packed and even parking was right! Very clean, modern looking restaurant. I ordered a small Tom Kha chicken soup which was delicious and HUGE! Prices were definitely reasonable, too. The small cup of soup was $5. The server was concerned that it might not be enough food but their serving sizes for everything are massive. Great service, will be back again.	5	Table Thai Bar & Bistro	4.5
"I don't know if I can afford the fancy drinks here on the reg as a student, thankfully a school's sales rep sponsored the evening! Had an easy time patting at Palazzo thanks to the fact they're one of the only hotels on the strip that don't charge for parking! Made our way over to Lavo which has an impressive entrance in the massive foyer.

Our group was seated in the lounge area, which I must say was super awkward seating--oddly spaced out so difficult to mingle, and the ottoman chairs made it seem like people were poppin a squat. No girl wearing high heels or a skirt can comfortably sit there AND appear lady-like...

It wasn't too loud and the live DJ was playing good music. The waiters were chill and informative. I ended up tasting 3 of their mocktails which were so good! Got the spiced mojito, raspberry cucumber spritzer, and the rosemary mint spritzer. Each was better than the next, and each one cost ~$10. 

Side note: the restroom's sink area was BEAUTIFUL.

Hopefully a sales rep brings us back here soon!"	4	LAVO Italian Restaurant & Lounge	3.5
"5 of us came here for lunch today during peak lunch hour. The parking lot was super easy to park in and we ran inside to put our name down on the list. They had signs saying that they won the ramen award in 2016 for Las Vegas. 

It would've made it easier if they took reservations, but given how popular they are, it makes sense that they don't need reservations. Our wait was about 15 minutes long and the waiters were very efficient at turning the tables around. I was even thinking that next time I might do take away because they were efficiently packing ramen to go, carefully packing the noodles and broth separately as to not mess up their masterpiece.

Once seated, the waitress took our drink orders, then lunch orders. They were quick, kind, and to the point. We ordered a chicken kaarage for the table, which I only took a bite of because I was saving room for the ramen. It was hot and tasty, but the batter was a little slimy in texture--interesting observation, I know! I ordered the Tori Ramen, which is made with chicken broth and has chicken chashu. I was starving and it was delicious! I did think it was a little too salty for my liking, and next time I'd likely add the spice bomb to give it more of a kick, but all in all, it was very good! I didn't even leave a drop--that's how hungry I was. The rest of the table ordered different types of ramen with different added toppings--everyone reall enjoyed their food but also thought it was on the salty side.

The food tasted good, customer service was great, and it was pretty cheap--$7.50 for the chicken ramen! Restaurant and restroom were also very clean. Will definitely be back--and can't forget to bring the stamp card! 4 ramen stamps = 1 free appetizer, and I'm looking forward to trying the gyoza next time! 

Tip: try to go in not peak food hours to get seated faster!"	4	Fukumimi Ramen	4
Came here with a large group after an event and the staff was wonderful. Quickly accommodated our large party and seated us promptly. The restaurant and bathroom are clean and well-maintained; the decor in both with the European tilework is very pretty. The parking is easy and convenient as their is a parking lot directly in front of the restaurant. It took a little while for our food to come to the table, I was also starving so it might have seemed like forever, but it was delicious! The waiters were great and helped in deciding which tacos are more popular, etc. I got three of the pork tacos (slow-roasted pork, chorizo, and al pastor), which cost me ~$10. I forgot which one, but one had pineapples in it which was my favorite! The tacos are delicious, though a little oily. I also thought they were tiny...I'm 5'2" and I was content after 3 tacos, but could have easily eaten a 4th. I highly recommend this place to everyone who's looking for some solid Mexican food, especially as they have great vegetarian options, as well! Looking forward to coming back.	5	Tacos & Beer	4
"Came here for lunch after purchasing a Groupon deal. Long line for food and service was relatively quick. Food was delicious but gave 4 stars bc there is very little information on what comes in each entree.

I highly recommend the chicken shawarma. Got it with double meat and it was very good--enough for 2 lunches for me! I thought the parsley fries were okay, good effort on the idea.

Clean restaurant with a modern feel. Bathrooms were clean too and parking was available and easy. Recommend for a healthier lunch option for sure, with good food!"	4	Parsley Modern Mediterranean	4
"Came here for Sunday brunch--easy parking, clean restaurant. Great menu with healthy and ""happy"" options. I got the ""if you like"" smoothie from the juice side--cost $9.69 with tax but it's delicious. The food serving sizes are gigantic. Great, kind service. Tony and Kate were very helpful and informative. 

Fun ambiance for a casual brunch with healthy options! Highly recommend!"	5	SkinnyFATS	4.5
Came here for a Sunday brunch. To begin, parking was obviously chaotic at the fun-filled Town Square. I parked far but enjoyed my stroll over to the restaurant. Once we got to the restaurant, we were asked to wait a few minutes to get our outside table ready. The restaurant is large and well-decorated. I loved the high ceilings and it could be the elder, classier sister of Cheesecake Factory. We asked to be seated outside and the waitress who walked us over was kind and let us pick the table we preferred. Our main waitress, Sophia, was on her third day at the job. She was kind, fun, and considerate. She was respectful and did her very best to provide suggestions and answer questions. The other waiters were very kind, too. The starter bread was awesome, especially the thin, crunchy triangular crackers. The food was good though it was a little cold and could have used more flavor. I got the Margherita flatbread while my friend got the Lasangna that came with a salad. Each of us paid roughly $15 for our meal. One thing I really liked about the restaurant was that the  menu had the calories written on it--helps a lot for the health-conscious people at an Italian restaurant! All in all, food was good but the experience is what would make us come back again. Fun place to do people-watching at, especially while sitting outside!	4	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
Great food, typical speed of In-n-out, even though it was empty they were a little slow. Great service and clean restaurant, though bathroom smelled funky... Awesome food as always	4	In-N-Out Burger	4.5
Great place! Pad Thai is so delicious! The portions aren't the greatest, & the reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because I don't eat meat & the spring rolls DO NOT say they contain meat!!! I ordered them & it was PORK!! Not egg rolls but "spring rolls"! I was sooo disappointed I haven't been back since! Otherwise service was great & pad Thai was awesome! Menus definitely need to be more clear.	3	Krung Siam Thai	3.5
Great authentic food, fair delivery time, courteous delivery person, and more food than we could eat!  Beef soup was homemade and to die for!  Definitely would recommend!!!!	5	Salsa Loca Mexican Grill	4.5
The atmosphere and service are stellar with an amazing wine selection. Then  when you get incredible beef tartar, A5 steak that melts in your mouth and the most delicious brussel sprouts you are in food heaven. Top it off with delicious deserts that are equally unique and beautiful as the entire experience.	5	Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak	3.5
"So I checked out the yelp reviews on this place before the wife and baby and I went. I expected it to not be super awesome but burgers are my absolute favorite so I def. wanted to give it a try. 

First bummer is the host\/ order taker person wasn't very friendly and was kind of rude. She asked to see my ID with my bank of America check card (which has my picture on it) and I told her the purpose of having your picture on it is so you don't need to show your ID with a $18 purchase. She has apparently has spoken with the credit card companies about this issue... Really? Im going to steal a credit and take my wife and new born baby to iloveburgers and buy 2 burgers and split 1 order of fries because HECK i don't want to spend too much with some one else's credit card. Ok whatever. On to the food. 

I read one review on here saying they thought i love burgers literally went to Costco and bought the big huge packs of frozen burgers and just served those up. HE WAS TOTALLY RIGHT ON. The quality seemed a lot like the Disneyland tomorrowland terrace burgers. Which are the same price except your not in Disneyland.

Definitely doesn't touch SMASHBURGER. 

Go to Smash buger if your looking for better quality, lower prices  and a more unique experience."	2	I Love Burgers	3
Smash Burger is the bomb. For a lower priced burger (in-n-out, The Habit) this place rocks. Burgers are definitely heavier so i always end up ordering the small burger. My burger of choice is the Sin City Burger. Fried egg on it is legit. I get the sauce on the side so i can control the amount on the burger (first time i went there was a little more than i liked). I have already been back there 3 times since my first visit. AND lets be honest. A place that stays open that is litterally next door to an INNY? Has to be good.	5	Smashburger	3.5
3.5 stars. Fairly good pizza. Excellent service.	4	Project Pie - MGM	4.5
This place was hard to find since the Raku Sweets place only had the Raku sign instead of Raku Sweets. The decor seems outdated with a lackluster ambiance. We tried the most expensive omakase. Most of the dishes were not good, but the tofu and the steamed foie gras custard were delicious. The poached egg with sea urchin, mountain yam, and salmon roe tasted ok - I'm not a big fan of mountain yam. The sashimi course only had the very common selections and offered nothing interesting, with the fish quality not as good as top sushi\/sashimi places in NYC. The meatball course was kind of heavy and it did not taste very good. The fluffy cheesecake was a bit disappointing and kind of bland. It is probably a better idea to just order a la carte instead of trying the omakase.	2	Raku	4.5
"Fairly good food overall:
Live scallops - good
Toro - delicious fatty tuna
Chilean sea bass - very good
Grilled salmon - pretty good
Grilled scallop - delicious
Grilled lobster - delicious
Strip steak - delicious"	4	Tetsu	4
Overpriced for quality of food, even for Vegas standards. Service was mixed but not bad. Redeeming qualities- good beer selection and desserts.	2	Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill	3.5
Meh. A little on the greasy side. Went for breakfast and the portions were ginormous. The food was decent, on par with Denny's or Coco's, aside of the huge portions. I'm a fan of the large coffee mugs though.	2	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
Located within New York, New York, this is one of those "authentic" Irish pubs which was constructed in Ireland then assembled within the casino.  The food is A-Ma-Zing for traditional irish pub grub. I strongly recommend the onion rings, which are marinated in a bloody mary mix prior to  being guinness beer-battered and then served up with spicy brown mustard. Yum!  Had the Shepherd's pie which is served in (for lack of a better term) a tin bucket-pretty cool. I have to say, the shepherd's pie paired perfectly with my yellow jacket (Guinness floated on top of shock-top hefeweizen). So delicious.  Was too full for dessert!	4	Nine Fine Irishmen	4
Service was amazing. The staff anticipated our needs and were very friendly. We were visited by the sommelier who helped us to pair our wines with our courses. The wines and food were perfect! This was my first visit to one of Chef Batali's restaurants and it will not be my last. If there is a downside to be had, it would be the fact that the restaurant is located inside the Venetian. It would lend itself to a quainter setting with the patio seating actually being outside versus in a mall located within a hotel\/casino. Thankfully we sat inside and the ambience was lovely, in addition to our wonderful meal.	5	B&B Ristorante	3.5
Tasted fresh. I ordered the ahi poke. Service was good and the fish tasted fresh. Little heavy on the soy. Not too much diversity in the rolls. Menu in japanese\/english to cater to both cultures.	4	Ichiban Sushi	3.5
"no way! the food was not good and attention: 
they gave us plastic silverware !?! 
explanation: ""we are very busy, sorry about that...""
i'll never visit that place again!"	1	Khoury's Mediterranean Restaurant	4
I love pizza! I've tried pizza in many countries, including Italy! I can say that this was one of the top top pizzas I've tried ... This should be treated as one of the must try attractions while in LV.	5	800 Degrees	3.5
"I wanted to try Shake Shack to see what the fuss was all about. I went there on a Saturday and the service was extremely fast. I don't eat meat, so my options were limited to the Portobello Mushroom burger to which I also added cheese fries.
The burger was okay, but the mushroom was fried and it was too greasy for me. The cheese fries were served with a container of melted American cheese (to pour over it, I assume).

The nice thing about Shake Shack is that they serve alcohol (or at least at this location).

It was an okay, fast and relatively cheap meal but I prefer In N Out"	3	Shake Shack	4
"I woke up really hungry and didn't want to go far to eat breakfast. Since we were staying at the New York, New York, I decided to check this restaurant out.

First of all, I must say that the service was EXCELLENT. It is very rare to find such good service in Vegas.

The food was good, typical breakfast food.
I ordered the pancakes and the portion was very generous. 

I would recommend this place for anyone staying at the hotel!"	4	Il Fornaio	3.5
"The food was good but seriously $5 for a tiny cup of black coffee with no refill? Should have gone to Starbucks.

Oh and they charge for tap water!"	2	Della's Kitchen	3.5
"this place was such a nice way to kick off the day at the Wynn.  Perfect service and great ambiance.  Our server was really nice and not snobby to us at all even though we each only ordered a salad and water...we wanted a fresh start to our day.  my friend and i had the best salad in a long time.  it had the best mushrooms i ever had in my life...im not kidding.
we sat inside but we could tell there was a good view of the hotel pool below.  when we go back to Vegas we are for sure hitting this place up again before we head down to the slots for free drinks :)"	5	Terrace Pointe Cafe	4
"hey this place was fun because when we ordered a bottle of wine we were happy campers.  our server Jo was so cool and we enjoyed his company.

food was Meh.  but that didnt really bother us because we had our bottle of reisling. fun place if you are getting ready to go out for the night and are waiting for the boys to finish up with their poker game."	3	Red 8	3.5
This was a fun place to go. As stated, it's a dessert house. I would recommend this after a small meal and in between. The desserts are served in an artistic manner and it's really fun to watch them prepare it. I recommend trying this place for an experience.	5	Sweets Raku	4.5
"I wish I had a bar just like this in my hometown. 

Very comfortable couches and tables to kick your feet up on. I didn't get any food, but I was pretty impressed with what was on the menu. I should have come here for dinner. 

The beer selection is a little disappointing though, just your general american brews. Bud, Coors, PBR, Wyders, Blue Moon etc. The atmosphere definitely makes up for their lack of selection.

The staff was very friendly, and let you relax. We had taken over one of the couches and a few chairs, and the staff would come around and check on us at just the right times. 

We liked it so much, we bought shirts and glasses so we could remember the great time we had.

I will definitely go back here on my next trip to Vegas."	4	Three Angry Wives	3
not quite what I ordered.. I ordered hot sauce got mild, wanted shredded chicken, got grilled chicken, put no pico, it came with pico	2	Cafe Rio	2.5
"I would never have gone to a place like this if somebody else wasn't paying. It's your typical ""pay a lot of money to have some guy talk to you in an accent and serve you half a plate of food for $60"" kind of place.

They had a good selection of wine, and the filet mignon was good... but not something I couldn't make myself (even if it was sliced by the executive chef.. woooo)

The atmosphere made me feel like I was eating in the middle of an Ikea store, and we had to pay for water.

If somebody wants to bankroll my dinner I'll go back, but I have had $5 cheeseburgers that I loved waaay more than my $42 prawns."	3	AquaKnox	4

Never heard of Bruxie before. We were staying at New York New York in Vegas and decided to try it for brunch before heading back home. It was one of the best fried chicken I have had out. I had the chicken with chipotle honey sauce. It came with a bacon cheese waffle. The chicken was so crispy and moist. The waffle was to die for.  My boyfriend had the original chicken sandwich. The waffle for the sandwich was thinner than my waffle. He didn't really care for the slaw on it. I tasted it and thought it was good. Just a matter of taste I guess. There is no denying how good the actual chicken is though. We also had the mac and cheese. It was really good. Wish there was a Bruxie near our home. I've been craving that chicken since leaving Vegas.	5	Bruxie	4.5
We had seen this place on the Las Vegas Channel in our hotel room and it looked interesting. We then ran into it walking through the mall from the Luxor to Mandalay Bay. We were looking for something sweet to eat. Decided to go in and sat at the bar as we usually do. The decor was quirky and beautiful. The bar staff was amazing. Best service we had in Vegas. The drinks were an experience. We had an appetizer ( Chicken Pot Pie Balls ) and dessert (a spice chocolate cake). Both were delicious. We look forward to going back next time we are in Vegas.	5	Rx Boiler Room	4
I have stayed at New York New York in Vegas twice now and Nine Fine Irishman's outside bar has become a staple for us. We usually start our day out there with a Bloody Mary. Some of our favorites are the Irish Nachos with corn beef and some of the best fried pickles. We tried the Bloody Mary onion rings this time since we are such Bloody Mary snobs.. lol. The were really good onion rings but we could not tell that the onions were supposedly soaked in Bloody Mary mix.  I would suggest maybe putting some Bloody Mary mix into the batter. We may even try that at home. Never less great onion rings. I'm sure when we come back again we'll be sitting at that bar with our Bloody Mary's at the start of our days in Vegas.	4	Nine Fine Irishmen	4
All the way from Northern California. A promoter promised us to get my female friend and I and my guy in for free. We went, made that our plan and they had the nerve to make us pay for my guy. The door person didn't care. The cashier said it happens a lot. That's pathetic.	1	Hyde Bellagio	3.5
I ordered delivery. Shrimp tempura was greasy. Tiger and dragon roll absolutely not worth 12.00 each. The worst!	1	Hanabi	4
This doesn't seem like a great place from the outside however I was so impressed once I walked in... I was WOWd with the great staff, inviting decorations and the the food is outstanding. I had the short stack of pancakes and sausage. Best I've ever had. I would come back over and over A+	5	Eat.	4
"Hmmm, where to begin.  If you like a steak medium to medium well, here is not the place to get it.  You either get a burnt or raw steak.
We all asked for waters to begin with while we read the menus.  I guess that set the tone.  We received our waters and 20 minutes later finally received food menus, but nothing was offered as far as drinks.
Out of the 6 of us in our group, none were impressed.  We had heard so many great things (from TV) so maybe our expectations were a little too high?  Far be it for me to want a medium well cooked steak (yeah I know for the steak that could be seen as an insult) but that's how I like it.  
What I got was literally charcoal on an extremely well done (burnt) steak.  When I put  my fork into, the charcoal literally flaked off.  The servers were kind and offered to have my steak cooked again and I nicely said ""no thank you,"" BUT they insisted.  So I asked for just a bit above medium.  My next steak was so rare in the middle it bled onto my plate.  
My husband and I ordered mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese.  The potatoes were $12 and truly nothing special, the macaroni and cheese left us burping mushroom flavor for an hour after eating 2 bites.  
We tried to be nice about everything and were maybe hoping there might be something great in the dessert, but we wouldn't know because we were never offered a desert menu, just our checks.
Fortunately, my steak was taken off, but I feel that $12 on potatoes and average service in a two hour time span is not what I was hoping for nor expecting.  Bummed to say, total disappointment."	1	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
"We did some serious damage and definitely got our monies worth as well as amazing service!!!  
The kimchi was fantastic!!  I have to forewarn you though, the beef Kalbi is a bit sweet and the pork belly is fatty....but some people love it that way.  
Our plates never went empty and ALL of the servers take care of every table! 
Even though an hour doesn't seem like much time, it really is more than enough!!"	5	Ginseng Korean BBQ II	3
"How can anyone give this disgusting place more than 2 stars?!?!?
To start with the place is a mess and the employees look like they can't stand their job and treat everyone the same...badly!
The pizza is sitting all over the counter tops.  As you order it, they take the cold, old pizza and put it in the over to reheat it.  So, we ordered a calzone and bread knot instead.  BIG mistake! The calzone was probably even worse, a strip of mozzarella, a couple pieces of pepperoni, rolled up and sitting on the counter (hiding) waiting for some sucker to Order it.  Then they burn it to a crisp.
The tables and chairs are disgusting!  We asked for a rag and some cleaning spray and they said they didn't have any????  Ummmmm  how do you clean the back area?  Oh they don't!"	1	NYP- Pizzeria	3.5
"My favorite restaurant in the whole wide world.  Every time I visit Las Vegas I dine at Lawry's.  The starter bread is tasty.  I always get extra of the Spinning Salad.  What can I say abut the Lawry's Pepper.  

I recommend getting the English Cut (3 thin slices) it's tender and full of flavor."	5	Lawry's The Prime Rib	4
"Once in a while it feels good to spend $145 on a great meal for two.  This is an excellent steak house.

Decor:  Dark and wooded.

Service:  Attentive.

Food Quality:  Excellent.  The bread was perfect.  The dinner salad was good (house dressing is tasty). I had a ribeye, near perfect.  Au-gratin potatoes nice and cheesy.  No desert.  Too full.

Price:  Expensive.  We are non-drinkers so we went with the Diet Cokes.  Mistake.  10 oz bottle for $2.25.  Stay away from the sodas."	5	Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House	4.5
"Went the week before Christmas.  The line was pretty short.

One of the better buffets in Las Vegas.  Very pricey.

My favorite items; Beef Brisket, Shrimp, Lobster Corn Chowder, and the whole dessert station."	4	Bacchanal Buffet	4
Holy Wow! Great coffee! I love their Dirty Chai. Mmmmm. Quaint and cozy atmosphere. And the muffins are delicious! Ask them to heat it up with a little butter ;) the only thing is sometimes they are a little snobbish and forget the food you ordered, but I still love it there! Drive-thru seems to be friendlier.	4	Sunrise Coffee	4.5
I rarely order my burgers medium rare, but the meat is so fresh I did. The "manly burger" was so delicious! Definitely gourmet! It had caramelized onions and bacon! The tempura battered onion rings and sweet potato fries were really good too! They make all the dips in house. Even the ketchup! Our server, Courtney was incredible! She was fun and easy on the eyes! Also, she recommended the caramel ice cream sandwich! Soooo good. Imagine a snicker doodle caramel ice cream sandwich. Good atmosphere. Outdoor seating is cool too. I'll be back.	5	Umami Burger -  SLS Las Vegas	4
Nice food, service is quick. Our new favorite in this area for Chinese food. Egg drop soup with fried noodles is yummy. Lunch portions are extremely generous.	5	Liu's Kitchen	3.5
This was my favourite eat out place in downtown Las Vegas.. they closed down some time back was pretty sad.. but they opened in this new location.. hurraaay .. very spacious, extra seating in the patio idea is awesome..spacious and romantic...they have retained the old favourites + added a lot more in the menu.. Way to go, delicious food and with great customer service..	5	Kabob Korner	3.5
Lovely service ... the hostess Regina was a doll! She was very attentive & friendly! Definitely recommend!!	5	Libre Mexican Cantina	4
"I would give 6\/5 stars if I could ...

After watching the video of the break-in that was edited to make it seem like the thieves were after their delicious tacos, I had to try the place. (I'm a sucker for good marketing.)

I am really glad I did! I told the cashier that I saw that video so we came to check them out. She asked ""so this is your first time here?"" and I said yes. Once we sat down, she brought us samples of their Aguas Frescas, which I've always wanted to try but didn't know where to start. She also brought us a sample of their quesadilla, which was seriously the best quesadilla I've ever had. 

We ordered chicken tacos and carne asada nachos. The food was all very yummy and the place was clean and cute. I'll definitely go back!"	5	Frijoles & Frescas Grilled Tacos	4
Steve saved my order and earned my loyal business! I was the second person in line, and the lady in front of me was ordering like, 15 subs and paying for each one separately. (Apparently she's picking up lunch for her entire office.) Since I was on my lunch hour, I started to think that I should just leave, cuz this lady's order was clearly going to take forever. While the lady was still going through each order, Steve asked what he could get started for me. By the time I officially placed my order with the cashier and paid, my sub was almost ready! I was impressed and thankful for Steve's consideration. Oh, and the sub was delicious as always. (Italian is the best!)	5	Firehouse Subs	3.5
Shelly who runs the front counter is amazing.  All the food is amazing. The best fast food Chinese in Las Vegas	5	Bobo China	4.5
"Total trash.
They over charged for several dollars.
The manager comes out with attitude for me because his cashier short changed me like 3 dollars plus. The manager took my receipt and then throws 2 dollars at me.
I never go back here.
Trash"	1	Carl's Jr Restaurants	2.5
"The cleanest grocery store in Las vegAs.
Great customer service.
They always have more then two cashiers open.
Open late on holidays.
It's never too crowded. Smiths and Walmart are too packed.
I always go to this store.
Their prices are great as well"	5	Glazier's Food Marketplace	3.5
"Great atmosphere 
Great food
Very reasonable pricing 
I promise you will be impressed by this Thai restaurant"	5	Panna Thai Restaurant	4
"Sweet chili chicken bowel was good.
Free order of pot stickers.
The place is very clean and great customer service."	4	Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill	4
Any restaurant that honors Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera is worth checking out. You don't really expect authentic Hispanic in Summerlin, (no chipotle doesn't count white folks) but this place was great. People that think it's just average are probably to used to having a Baja blast with their burrito to know any better. Take it from a brown guy, this place does it right.	5	Casa Don Juan  - Summerlin	4
Really good food, college student friendly prices, and good service. I eat here about 3 times a week. It's a perfect go to for right after or before class.	5	Breakfast & Grill Cafe	4
Below average Chipotle. Chips were stale, portions where small, staff was nice though. Ordered a burrito and the girl used a ripped tortilla. When she first saw it she started to get a new one but couldn't pull it out right away so she gave up and used the ripped one. Slightly disappointed. I'm not expecting fine dining, but would at least like it to be comparable to other visits.	2	Chipotle Mexican Grill	3.5
This place was very disappointing. They didn't honor the half off deal on drinks as advertised on the 20 ft LED screen out front, drinks took forever, food was burnt, and the employees had a white mysterious powder on their noses that made them jittery. Wonder what that was??	1	Papaya King	2.5
It's a fast food joint off the strip. Not exactly fine dining. Are you drunk, broke and\/or both? Perfect.  Negative reviews are pointless for a checkers. What did you honestly expect?? What is a five star experience at a fast food drive through supposed to be??	5	Checkers	2
"This place is INCREDIBLE. 

My boyfriend and I ate here last night when we were looking for something with a vegan menu. We happened to walk by here and was greeted instantly by their owner (I forgot his name, but he's such a great guy!) 

I can assure you, that their vegan menu is ACTUALLY vegan! And they had incredible options which made it hard to decide! The owner was gracious enough to recommend some dishes for us- which were all BEYOND delicious. We had lentil soup, street veggie sandwiches, the vindaloo and MUCH more. There owner even recommended a fantastic wine which paired well with everything. 

We will DEFINITELY be coming back time and time again. So good!!!"	5	Urban Turban	4
"I am OBSESSED with this place!

I've heard and known about it for awhile but never tried t until tonight. And IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Everything was (shockingly) reasonably priced, and very delicious! I had the eggplant and kale in vodka sauce- I forgot what it's called- with their spiked apple cider and bread pudding. The pasta was creamy, the drink was perfectly spiked, the pudding was yummy and it was all vegan! I also tried a friend's green curry and the burger which were also incredible. I want to come back every week! The staff seemed to be very friendly and quick with service. This is a MUST for any vegans or just food lovers!"	5	VegeNation	4.5
"It's tough to find an all you can eat sushi place that is fairly priced for a-la-carte as well. The rolls came out fresh and fast! The server was attentive and friendly and kept our waters fresh even after the bill was paid. 
We have tested at least 7 other sushi spots in the area... we will definitely return here."	5	The Sushi	3.5
Extremely well priced. Excellent food. Huge portions. Will definitely eat here 2-3X a month going forward. Nice atmosphere on all levels. One of my favorites for this food category. A MUST TRY! !!	5	Yassou	4.5
All around Echo & rig is a pleasure to go to, every single time. The food is exceptionally well priced and it's really fresh and delicious. The service is hands-down some of the best you'll get even at a five-star restaurant. It's a fun place. I would probably eat there three times a week if it was just a little closer to me. I cannot imagine anyone eating here and not being happy with the overall experience. I can safely say it is my top 5 favorite places to eat in the entire city and I know a dozen people that feel the same way.	5	Echo & Rig	4.5
I had been to this place a few years back for happy hour and decided to try it again. I was so unbelievably impressed by how good the food was for dinner. one of the better steaks that I have had in a while and half the price if not even less than half versus other establishments. I could not recommend this place enough to people especially if they enjoy the downtown vibe	5	Triple George Grill	4
I've eaten many places over the years and this is by far the freshest food I've seen plated, on every course. Lunch is worthy of any 5 star restaurants dinner options. I would and will come here over and over in the future, which is something I never do in this city of endless new options.	5	Estiatorio Milos	4
Truly not giving it ONE star to be an idiot. Really feel when you add it all up, its not worth more. Horrible wait time, average ambience, food is NOT good at all for the price and would NOT be worth a repeat visit even if 50% less.  In Dorchester, maybe this flys but in this city ( a mile long ) of 35,000 places to eat, 10000 of which serve MUCH BETTER hamburgers, this place was almost funny to me. No b.s. THE most average nothing hamburger I have had almost ever in my life, including a bowling alley hamburger... Save your money and 60 minute wait time and go ANYWHERE else. Truly wondering what the F Paul is doing on the show when he pretends developing recipes and whatnot because this isnt even remotely restaurant worthy. I pray the food here is just the F U menu and not the real quality served at main restaurant. Literally wasted calories and considering taking up Bulimia due to this lunch.	1	Wahlburgers	3.5
Best location. Priced identical to others even though should be 30% more for location.  Food great. People great. Nicest of all TM on interior. Absolutely excited it is in the area. Really love this place	5	Teriyaki Madness	3
Save ur money .. go to chipotle .. wasnt verry appealing at all so i gave it a try.. not the best burrito but hey the people that work inside is friendly..	2	Moe's Southwest Grill	2.5

"My friends and I dined at Mesa Grill Saturday night.  We ordered three appetizers- queso fundido, tuna tartar and the shrimp tamale.  We were blown away with the appetizers, especially the queso fundido and for a lactose intolerant woman, that is saying a lot.  For  4 Latinos (who cook traditional food) to rave about a Mexican restaurant, it has to be good.

I always judge a Mexican restaurant by its Chile Relleno.  Bobby got it right!  It was stuffed with just the right ingredients with a great flavor.

We spent 2 hours at the restaurant eating and drinking.  Mesa Grill is be a mandatory stop on all of our future trips."	5	Mesa Grill	4
"Pros: It's in Vegas. The interior is open and bright. The cappucino was strong yet delightful. (1 star for location, 2 stars fo espresso).

Cons: The service was less than desirable. Even that was better than napoleon- stale, rubbery and lacking goo flavor. Avoid the pastries! (0 stars for bake goods). 

Want fabulous chocolates? Head to Vosges @ Caesars."	3	Espressamente illy	3.5
"Just went to eat at the Oyster Bay with my spouse. We were  looking for good honest italian cuisine, no fuss, no bs, just good fresh seafood and ""Al dente"" pasta.  We were not disappointed, in fact, overwhelmed!

We ordered fried calamari and Mediterranean Linguini.  Must say, the calamari were the best, freshest, I ever had.  The linguini's served with shrimps, mussels, clams, calamari basting in a freshly made pomodori sauce spiced to our liking.  Service by Monica was attentive and efficient.  

Overall, a great choice in a city were finding a good balance between quality and price is not an easy bet.

For the 2 of us, total bill with two glasses of wine: 99$ plus tip.

Well worth the small detour from the glitzy strip!"	4	Oyster Bay Seafood	3
I only ate here for brunch and let me tell you I was NOT disappointed!! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the food, oh my...the food was unbelievable.  By far, the best brunch I have ever and probably will ever go to.  They had such a gigantic array of food that I got overwhelmed just looking at the different dishes.  They even had whole turkeys and prime rib that you could choose from, fresh ice cream - not the vending machine kind.  Everything tasted fresh and you could tell that it was quality food.  Some other buffets lack in taste because they have to cook such a large quantity, but not here.  Seriously, words can't describe how much I recommend this buffet.  My cousin said that you have to go to the Saturday brunch, since any other morning they only serve breakfast items.	5	The Buffet	3.5
They didn't have a meatless ramen option on the menu.  She created one for me! amazing service & amazing Thai teas!  They have a buy one get one on Thai teas and boba teas! My hubby had pork fried rice said it was the best he ever had.  Will definitely be back!	5	Yagyu Ramen	4
Excellent breakfast sandwich.  Only wish they had toasted the English muffin.  But regardless would get it again.  Yum.   And their latte was great as well.  Tons of options and hoodies to try.	5	The Market	3.5
Amazing.  Would go again in a second!  Got the farm house burger and sweet potato fries.  Best I have ever had!!	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
"Emeril's, you got it going on.  Great food, great ambiance.  Servers were polite and on-point.  The place was packed, but they never forgot about us.  I had the Alaskan King Snow Crab legs.  They gave me more cuz it was the end of the night and I was filled up.  The crab legs were fresh and sweet.  so so good.  I had some other items, but I cant remember..Blame it on the Alcohol.  All items were good.  Looking forward to my next visit.
."	5	Emeril's New Orleans Fish House	3.5
i'm not a huge fan of buffet style food.  But I must admit, i was blown away at the amount and quality of food that was served.  Food selection can vary from Mexican, sushi, mash taters, fried chicken, bacon, enchiladas.  Carving station with prime rib n brisket, omelet station.  Desert bar.  Great service, staff was friendly and efficient at picking up plates and refilling drinks.  I am looking forward to my next visit here.	4	MGM Grand Buffet	2.5
when you see pictures in the magazines, you say that sandwich is not that big.  But when you actually dine here, you see first hand.  this sandwich is huge.  If you are a Hot pastrami lover, then this is your place.  Sandwich was great.  getting hungry just thinking about it.  looking forward to my next visit.	5	Carnegie	3
This is a must visit place.  Good Food, excellent drinks.  Good vibe.  Perfect spot to get ur Vegas party started.  Chips and Salsa was real good.  Must try the Tacos, they were decent.	4	T&T - Tacos & Tequila	3.5
Excellent food, excellent service....had a special birthday event held here, worked with the manager to make sure the night was special.  They created a customized, personalized menu, centered around our party.  4-course meal at it's best.  The menu consisted of a appetizer, salad, entree and deserts.  Food was very fulfilling, atmosphere and vibe was great.  Some people in our group had never experienced "fine dining" and they were blown away by the presentation and how prepared our hostess was....looking forward to visiting again....Nite was memorable	5	Roy's Restaurant	4.5
I have heard alot about Mr. Chow.  So i was looking forward to trying it out.  Food was good, service is GREAT.  Waiters and waitresses have great hospitality.  There is even a show, where the guy makes the signature Mr. Chow noodles in front of you.  The ambiance and environment of this place is romantic and soothing.  Food was good.  Be prepared to spend some money.  overall great experience.  will dine again.	4	Mr Chow	3
waited forever to get seated alomost an hour, then when the hour was up, they wanted us to wait another hour...SIKE..not happening.  so when we decided we were leaving, mysteriously there was a open table.  Got seated and there were open tables everywhere.  Ordered the food, but it took so long, I was no longer hungry.  We ordered our food at the same time, but it came out at different times.  Plus the food was cold.  Definately will not be back.....	2	Hash House A Go Go	4
cool , decent hamburger spot.  The location is great, right on the strip.  Great food after a good day\/night of drinking.  Burgers were good, u can add on some items, like eggs, bacon, chili.  That's to give your mouth more flavors to enjoy.  The burgers are big, not like you typical burger shacks. I would dine here again and recommend.	3	Fatburger	3.5
Rooms were decent, typical Vegas hotel room.  Service was great, hospitality was on point.  we were total taken care of.  Had a great stay, will stay again.	4	MGM Grand Hotel	3
I consider myself a Churrascaria expert, I have dined at alot of different Churrascaria and I didnt find this one up to par.  Meat wasnt that great.  service and hospitality was good.  just didnt care for the food.	2	Pampas Churrascaria Brazilian Grille	3
We visit Caesars Palace approximately five times a year and always make it a point to go to Payard for breakfast. We love the quality of the food and the great service. On our last visit we had Abschen (Sp?) as our waiter three days in a row. We've known him for years and love him. He provides great, prompt service and you can tell he cares for his customers. Christina is a wonderful person and fantastic Waitress too.  Rumor has it this may close and become a Giada restaurant. If that happens don't expect any business from us. We like a restaurant with a "real" Chef! Hopefully we'll see Christina and Abschen at a different location in Caesars.	5	Payard Pâtisserie & Bistro	3.5
Amazing!  Try the personal cheese pizza topped with ricotta!  Amazing creamy deliciousness!  Also tiramisu is to die for!   Will be back!	5	Grimaldi's Pizzeria	4
Amazing service.  Server was Ryan.  Came here for dinner last night about 8pm? I got the linguini lemon smoked salmon (fresh made pasta). Sauce was delicious salmon was amazing it was about $28 for this dish.  Definitely worth the price.  Hubby got spaghetti and meatballs.  About $26 for his? He liked his as well, but said he liked mine better & he doesn't even like fish.   Yes,  it was that good!  Bread they have is also good!  They do a balsamic\/olive oil mix.  tiramisu was to die for!  Mix the whipped cream, tiramisu & what ever the goop stuff is together...... omg ! Will most definitely be back!	5	Panevino Italian Grille	4
"When you go to a restaurant and you say... ""the best from here was the salsa"" should definitely tell you everything...
-caldo de rest was not fresh....
-tortila chips are not home made....
-agua de pina is from a machine not home made."	1	Los Molcajetes	4
I was thinking this would be more of a sit down restaurant where you order from the table instead of a chipotleish style of Mediterranean food.  Thought there would be more room inside for eating.  The only thing good I had was the cucumber chiller which I would go back for.  Not so much the food\/service.	1	Parsley Modern Mediterranean	4.5
Amazing food! Best Thai teas in the area!  Worth the wait.  Line out the door when they open for dinner.  Service is good as well.	5	Lotus of Siam	4
1st time coming here for me yesterday with Hubby.  He had been before though on previous trip.  For drinks we had Thai teas (those were creamy & delicious, not overly sweet).  For an appetizer we got the bachi pickles (which is 6 different veggies that have been pickled). All of those were really good!  For our burgers:  Hubby got the Ronin burger.  I got the No Meat Here "Burger",  it was the best veggie burger I have ever had.  Told my family about this that is coming to Vegas today.  We will definitely be back!	5	Bachi Burger	4
We ate here Thursday night.  Called ahead the day before made reservations for 630 pm.  Was able to walk right in pay and go get a table.  No lines!  Not sure what our servers name was right now.  He was amazing though!  He offered us a bucket of steamed crab legs!  So much better than what is on the buffet.  They had good shrimps, really good fish,  the mussels\/clams were delicious!   Truffle Mac and cheese yummy!   Their selection of desserts omg!  I had 4 yes 4 of the creme brûlée! Tried a bite of my sisters macaroons the red and green (red filling tasted like fluff). (Green was coffee). So good!   My hubby & grandma were bragging on the prime rib (apparently to die for) Will definitely be back here!  .	5	Le Village Buffet	3
This place is the best place in Vegas to eat breakfast! I found it on Yelp 2 years ago, when I was in town for a convention. Always have to come here when I am in town. Food is excellent and the owner is really friendly and greets everyone. Come here and support a hard working family.	5	Mr Mamas	4.5
AWESOME Fish and chips! I am a big fan of fish and chips, so we had to try it. This place did not disappoint at all. I would definitely come back.	5	Fulton Fish Frye	3.5
I have been coming to this buffet once or twice a year for the last 10 years, when I go to Vegas. It has always been my go to place. The last few times, the food quality has really gone downhill and the price keeps going uphill. This is the last time I will come here. The dinner was $34 this time. Most of the food was not good. It's sad, but the table consensus for the best things, was the pizza and the gelato. I tired a little bit of a lot of the options and didn't really find anything that was really good. All the food was nasty to so so. The prime rib, which has always been my favorite, was flavorless and really fatty. The crab legs seemed smaller and were really salty. I have always recommended this buffet to anyone I talked to going to Vegas. I won't do that anymore. I would take the $34 and eat elsewhere. It makes me sad to give this review, I was looking forward to this buffet for 2 months, and it was a major let down.	2	Carnival World Buffet	3.5
Dante is the man. Knowledgeable, helpful, and overall cool guy. Go here for all your gaming needs and questions.	5	GameWorks	3
"Understandably, my family and I were moved from the bar due to me not having my ID. However, unfortunately the hostess didn't smile when we were seated and my moms food came out inedibly salty, and the manager Ron never came out to apologize. The only saving grace was Keith our serverr, he was kind and polite. 

Don't come to this BJs, service and food quality are falling off."	2	BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse	4
"For the most part no matter what you order, be it food or their various coffee items, it is going to be tasty and satisfying. However, be prepared for pretty high prices.

For example, today I ordered the Ron Jeremy Sandwich, and a medium Michael Jackson. Based off those names you get the vibe for this joint. It was great, sandwich was delicious and filling, coffee was rich and delicious. What was not so great was those two items together cost 13$ and some change. A little on the expensive side if you ask me. 

However, if you are looking for a great cup of coffee or a delicious sandwich, and do not mind the prices, I highly recommend this groovy joint. 

Have not had an baked goods yet, but these also look delicious!"	4	MadHouse Coffee	4
The golf is obviously cool, but the secret is the Memphis burger. That burger is straight fire. Best burger I've had and I've had a lot. Holy LIT	5	Topgolf	4
Drunken noodle can chicken curry is magical. Delicious, generous portion. Definitely get your money worth here. I got level 6 spice and it's perfect for me. Service was great as well!	5	Thai St Cafe	4
Cashier with the tattoo on his right arm is a miserable human, no aloha spirit. Food is classic L&L but this guy isn't adding anything to the experience.	2	L & L Hawaiian Barbecue	2.5

"*Place is kinda of greasy and could use a good detail cleaning
*Sushi: I give it two stars.  Not the best, but not the worst.  Grocery store sushi is the worst.  They did not bring wasabi or ginger, the soy sauce was old or  because it gets hot in the place it can go bad fast.
*We ordered the teppanyaki grill:  Miso soup was luke warm, salad was ok, the meal prep was very good and entertaining.  The food was good because it was cooked right in front of us."	2	Hikari	4
Capriotti's is definitely my favorite sandwich shop in town. The sandwiches are always fresh, and I feel you get a pretty decent deal for your money. My favorites are the Bobbi and the Capastrami. Occasionally, you'll get an offer to do their online survey. As a reward, I've gotten a few bucks off my next sandwich, and even a free small sub. Definitely a must try if you haven't been here before	5	Capriotti's Sandwich Shop	3.5
So disappointing. I expected great things from the Aria, but their buffet is comparable to Palms quality if not worse. I love buffets and I love the Aria hotel but I won't be coming back to the buffet unless it's free again. The selection is small and the flavors are mediocre at best. If you have the choice, go to the Bacchanal down the street or even the Wynn. The value there is so, so much better.	2	The Buffet at ARIA	3
Not all Tropical Smoothie Cafe's are created equal. And unfortunately this place earned my first one star. This location needs a serious revamp. First of all, they're highly under-staffed, and I appreciated the one employee doing all he could. But he was overwhelmed, and it took awhile to take our order. And it was really hot in there. Perhaps problems with their A\/C? The young man was great, apologetic and made our drinks. Unfortunately, he made my drink wrong. He offered to fix it, but it wasn't much better. I don't fault him, that's a lack of training. He also informed me that they were having a problem with their POS system so my rewards didn't register. I can't fault him, but this location needs help.	1	Tropical Smoothie Cafe	2
"Over the years I've been to all the different Archi's locations, and they've been my favorite Thai spot in town.

My go to dishes are Pad Thai, Spicy Beef Basil, Pad Kee Mow, and Chicken Panang Curry. You can order the level of spiciness from 1-10.

I've been to this location many times, but my last couple of visits were disappointing. The food took over 45 minutes to arrive, and the service wasn't that great. On another occasion, I waited about an hour. I've been coming to Archi's for quite some time now, and they're a 5 all day, but this location gets a 4."	4	Archi's Thai Kitchen	4
Great view and awesome service. The view of the strip is absolutely amazing. The food is really good. The food quality is excellent and came out really quick. Ashley is awesome and an amazing bartender. She is extremely friendly and service was outstanding. Will keep coming back	5	Twin Peaks	3.5
I really love katsu so I had to try this place out. It's a tiny establishment, so they can get pretty packed. I ended up waiting about 30 minutes, and unfortunately there really isn't a waiting area inside. I ordered the tonkatsu with curry, which was quite delicious. You also can grind sesame seeds at your table to mix with your katsu sauce. The katsu was crisp and tasty, and the curry was thick with chunks of potatoes. As far as price, this place isn't too bad; I just wished they offered bigger portions. Although I was satisfied, it didn't quite hit the spot. Service was very friendly, and it's a quaint little restaurant.	4	Tonkatsu Kiyoshi	4.5
This place simply has excellent food and excellent service. The free chips and salsa always come out very quick and fresh. The quality of the food is really good, and they give you good portion sizes. I always order one of their margaritas, and they definitely hit the spot. I highly recommend the fajitas of course, and they come with fresh tortillas that are made in house. This place is definitely a must try, and surely it will not disappoint.	5	Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina	4.5
Island Flavor is without a doubt one of the best local spots in town. They have a menu with a wide variety of options and huge portions. I usually like to get a combo plate and mix it up every once in a while. It's a nice quaint restaurant that makes you feel like you're definitely in Hawaii. Service is friendly, and I've never had a bad experience when calling in orders for pick up. This place is a must try.	5	Island Flavor	4.5
So I was told this is the new spot from the Annie Pho owner. The place is a wide open restaurant that's spacious and simple. The food came out very quickly and the service was very good. I came with family and we started off with egg rolls and chicken wings. Everything tasted great. I ended up getting the lemon grass chicken, but got to try the pork chops from my brother's plate. Both were excellent. I also tried some of my Mom's pho and the broth was delicious. The portions were good and the prices are reasonable. This place is a must try	5	Pho 88	4.5
Yes, I have an affinity towards Roberto's, and they always hit the spot! They're cheap and consistent. As for this location, I've never had a bad experience. They are extremely fast and friendly, and they always go above and beyond	5	Roberto's Taco Shop	3.5
Luckily this place is right down the street from where I live. I usually like to come here to grab a quick bite to eat. The service is pretty quick and the food comes out fresh. The best part is they are very generous with their portions. I usually get the kalbi\/katsu combo, and they give you a lot. The katsu is nice and crispy, but the kalbi never seems to be just right. On one occasion it was kind of bland, and another time it was really tough. All in all I recommend this place if you're into Hawaiian food and looking for a quick bite to eat.	4	L & L Hawaiian Barbecue	4
Word of mouth inspired us to make the trip for lunch and it was beyond worth it. I personally tried the "chicken" and I have to say it was undoubtedly one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The seating is limited, but I will gladly stand to enjoy another sandwich.	5	The Goodwich	4.5
I have had the pleasure of eating here 6 times now, and I felt as though a review was in order. I have been here for two of my birthdays, couple of business meetings, and a couple dinners outside when the weather was nice. The food, the atmosphere, the service, all have been great. No matter what you decide on for your entree, you must always get the Crispy Chicken Skins, and the Veal Meatballs. You'll be happy you did.	5	Carson Kitchen	4.5
Even if I am just getting home from a long Mexico trip I won't hesitate to go straight to Tony's. The Chorizo breakfast burrito has been a life saver sometimes. The staff is always very friendly and genuinely cares about your experience. Great food, great beer, at a great price point.	5	Tony's Mexican Food	3.5
Pretty fair to say that In N Out burger is always good. But, the reason I wanted to review this particular one was the exceptional service of the employees at this location. Every time i come to this location in particular I get my quickly, and the employees seem as though they genuinely care about you having a positive experience. Kudos!	5	In-N-Out Burger	4.5
Soon as we walked in the staff seemed irritated and burdened to serve us. Pretty far from "Happy Hour". Made it to the bar, and had to wait a 10 minutes to get a drink. Mind you that they were far from busy. The $14 burger was sub-par to say the least. I've been there a couple of times, but this will be my last time giving McFaddens a chance.	1	McFadden's Restaurant and Saloon	2
"I have lived in Vegas all my life and every time I get an opportunity to go to Burger Bar- I go. 
In my opinion the Kobe burger is one of the most elegant burgers that money can buy. The best part is I can eat like a king for a reasonable price point, in a casual environment with plenty of beers to choose from."	5	Burger Bar	4
"Really savory ramen soup, all the positive reviews about this place are true. You can choose any of the soups and you will be receiving nothing but the best delicious flavor. 

I went during the late evening hours and it was busy, u could get lucky n just wait 5 min to be seated but could be a rare case. 

Overall great Ramen Soup in town!!!!"	5	Monta Ramen	4
So far best buffet at the strip! I took me about two hours to get in on a thursday night but it was all worth it. They have really great food and it all has authentic taste. Starting from the mexican to the asian. They have Mediterranean food as well. They have great choice of meat on the grill like a brazilian steak house would fresh, flavorful and juicy. There dessert area is full of over 15 different cupcakes which my favorite was the rum with vanilla cheesecake custard fill.  You can also find cheesecake, bread pudding, and ice cream.  If you are looking for seafood this also a great place to go too they serve hot and cold crab legs and you can find shrimp scampi as well as a assortment of shrimp. Next time you are by the miracle mile shops or just hanging out at planet hollywood make sure to drop by to fill up a big appetite of goodness.	4	Spice Market Buffet	3
Very great atmosphere, the fresh hot bread and the olive oil with garlic spice is delicious. The Penne Franco and the Wessie are so awesome. There homemade orange soda is definetly the drink u want to get. You can sit at the pizza bar and watch pizzas be made while you eat. The atmosphere is somewhat romantic and family style. This place a way better than going to Olive Garden!!!	5	Carrabba's Italian Grill	3.5
"I decided to give this place a try. It just open recently and have been wondering what they have to offer.

Their menu has over 100 items to choose from and they also have a separate menu for their boba's and smoothies. The prices also range starting at 2 bucks to 7 and as their grand opening is buy one boba $3 bucks and get one free.

Their combination beef noodle pho is pretty flavorful as well as their combination sea food. 

The main star from this visit where their potstickers, they were crispy and the filling has very good flavor, they pair it with a sweet like soy sauce which just gives it that extra kick. I would definitely be back for more of these.

The staff is pretty melo no attitude to worry about here, the restaurant is really spacious and they have a corner with DJ speakers and lights possibly some karaoke but don't know yet. 


For all those locals out here check the new place out, come and try for yourself and let us know your experience.

So far this visit was delicious and pleasant!"	4	Mr. Sandwich	3
"I am in love with this place. I was driving by with my friend and she informed me that this place had really great food. I am always up for trying something new and delicious. 

When I walked in the restaurant looks relax, they have comfortable seating, the menu is pretty large. My friend recommended me to try the Local Plate witch includes Teriyaki chicken, teriyaki Beef, Hawaiian Macaroni salad, steam rice and two spam masubi for less than $8.

For starters this was definitely a plate to have, never had a spam masubi and man I tell you I dream of having one of those everyday. Even If you never been a spam fan this will definitely change your mind. One thing I would inform the seaweed that it is wrap with the flavor is a little strong but It goes very well. You must try and see for yourself. 

I can honestly say this place will have you addicted!!!!"	5	Aloha Kitchen	4
By far the best place to get your coffee and hang out with friends, the ambience is cool. All there desserts, coffee, sandwich and pesto salad are amazing. The owner is super nice and really cool. The staff are friendly. Once you come here you will definitely be back.	5	MadHouse Coffee	4
"They have a variety of pastas and salad and pizza, your pizza is made to order you can select from the combinations they have to choose from or build your own for 13 bucks, to drink you can order beer or fountain drinks. 
The pizza is thin crust nicely toasted from the brick oven,I tried the porc Blanc pizza, its white sauce with prosciutto and aragula. The combination is amazing and added to that is fresh mozzarella and caramelized onions, this is a must try very delicious!"	5	Social Life Pizza	3.5
pretty good place.  my father would rate this place a four star, he is here every moment that he can get to eat. i luv it because it is clean and it is good for family gathering. If you get a chance to eat here and love seaqfood try as an entree the tom yum soup (sea food mix). It will be good enough for four or more people to eat. Also, most their plates can feed more than two. check it out!!!	4	Archi's Thai Cafe	3.5
Excellent!! It offers a lot of different ethnic food. The service is spectacular. The ambience is very nice and busy. The waiters are nice. This buffet offers pretty good food than the others that are around. Try this spot first before the others.	5	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
This is a very mellow spot to eat some good food. Nothing fancy. I usually always get their wings because they are crispy and juicy! Their seasonal veggies are worth getting. They have other food items posted on their wall when they are new or seasonal, so dont forget to read those too. Something to try are there Roti they are flaky, crunchy and soft at the same time and buttery they are good just alone. All their food items are mostly in the range 4 to 6 bucks. Its worth stopping by here if ur looking for some good,fast and affordable food!	5	Big Wong Restaurant	4
"Craving Mexican food in Vegas? Check this place out! They have great big tacos really delicious. There nachos are fully loaded and yummy. Friendly staff a +.

The burrito is huge could feed two people.

Great thing about this place it is open 24hours and food taste fresh at any time.

Check it out after the club!!!"	4	Roberto's Taco Shop	2.5
The flavors they add to their dishes are very delicious. The restaurant is small but the food flavor makes up for it. The customer service is very friendly. They have pictures of their dishes around the restaurant so you know what you have a clue of what it will look like which help for those who aren't familiar with Peruvian cuisine. This is a great little restaurant to check out if you are looking to try something different from the ordinary, take my word for it! My best choice if you are into is to go for the Lomo Saltado!	5	Perú Chicken	4.5
This place is lucky there is not a way to degrade them on yelp, but they seriously suck they can not even get there delivery orders out on time and to top it off the man that answerered the phone is so rude. Seriously the worst service from this place. Do not try n order here and have your food never delivered.	1	New York Pizza & Pasta	4
"We had our wedding reception here on February 21 in the Terraza private room, which has it's own balcony that looks out to the Strip.  Everything was amazing!  Appetizers (calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and Caesar salad), Pastas (shrimp with white sauce on spaghetti, Italian sausage on penne), Entrees (Salmon Oreganato, Chicken Parmigiana), and Desserts (chocolate cannoli and fresh fruit) were all amazing!  All 48 of our guests could not stop raving about how good the food was and how full they were!

Our waiter, Michael, did an amazing job and made sure we were taken care of all night.  He also surprised us with 2 songs and his amazing opera voice!  I have to give a special thank you to Deidre Kennedy, our special events coordinator.  She was such a delight to work with and made our day as seamless as possible.  She even met with me earlier in the day to go over exactly how I wanted the room and our wedding items set up.  

Awesome food!  Awesome service!  I know we will continue coming here on our frequent trips to Vegas and whenever our guests return, they will as well :)"	5	Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Las Vegas	4
I have ate at N9NE several times.  Most recently, back in March.  We needed space for a party of 18 and at the last minute.  They were able to accommodate us in a private room which was perfect.  The whole experience was great...the food, the service.  All of our guests were pleased and left with full stomachs!  My 2 favorite dishes are the salmon and the surf and turf (filet mignon and lobster tail).  Don't miss out on the lobster mashed potatoes!  I'm always too full by the time dessert comes around, so I've never tried any.  This is literally the only place that I love enough to leave the Strip to come eat at.  I wish the one in Dallas wouldn't have closed years ago!	4	N9NE Steakhouse	4
I would personally give this place 4 starts, but since my husband complained he was still hungry afterwards, I'll settle at 3.  The restaurant is gorgeous! We went here in January for dinner at 8 pm and it has a beautiful view of the Strip that looks out onto the Bellagio fountains. Very romantic! We shared the antipasti platter and a romaine salad to start. For dinner we had a filet, fried Brussels sprouts and an order of spaghetti. All of the food was wonderful, but the portions were a bit small for the price. I also think we are just use to American size entrees...not what is actually served in Europe.  Giada did a wonderful job with this place!	3	Giada	3.5
Came here for the first time, heard this place was a go to. The atmosphere was clean, cute and fun! I ordered their famous goblet drinks, definitely cute and good but was surprised with it being almost $40. I think that although it was a must try, I'd probably will not be getting one again, at least not for that price. I didn't get to try the food here but I'm sure they are good to. Will definitely be back to give the food a try, worth checking out while you are in vegas!	4	Sugar Factory	3.5
Not sure what the big is here wasn't that impressed ! There no way I would wait an hour to eat here we got lucky got seated in 10 min ! I wouldn't come back . No better then a cafe in house some where  .. not sure why people are lining up to eat here !	2	Cracker Barrel Old Country Store	3
"at first, i was really excited to eat here. being rated number 1 buffet and everything, i thought i would give it a try. waited about an hour, but for good food it would be totally worth it. for a saturday lunch came out to about $55. i think the little skillet thing holder they give you is adorable but the grease of them? not so much.

all the chefs and servers are very friendly.. though there were alot of awkward moments when i put something on my plate and one of the chefs goes, ""chef so and so made that! isnt he good?"" and theres a bit of an awkward pause because I havent tried the dish... i cant tell you its good but i dont know what to say...  but they are all very friendly.
on the staff, the only part that kinda got to me was drinks. our drinks was never refilled, nor did they come by and ask if we wanted more. it was prob because they were super busy? but i would like more than one cup of lemonade for my 50 dollar meal... 

as for the food. they all look very exquisite. i wanted to eat everything. and i tried. my friend and i would share dishes just so we could try most of them.  i was looking for a dish that would make me want to go back and get more but it didnt happen. our verdict was.. greasy. the food is good but not what i had expected for a number 1 rated buffet.
desserts looked delicious but i have had better. for the first time, the macaroons were sour.. jam? maybe I am used to the way LA makes it... (Milk, bottega louie, mochilato, etc) but these were the first that i did not like.. 

i eat at ayce places pretty often but i was bloated and had this nasty feeling afterwards... i think its because of the grease...
if you havent tried it, by all means you should and judge for yourself. this place clearly has good reviews from other people. but i personally would not go again."	2	Bacchanal Buffet	4
Great service, good menu, fair prices.  I've visited this one several times, and would gladly return.  It's a decent place comparable to other sushi joints I've been to around town.  They offer an all-you-can-eat option that follows the same rules as other places around town.  The floor space inside makes it one of the smaller establishments to which I've been a patron.	4	Yama Sushi	4
Awesome.  My new favorite Italian place, with Chicago Joe's and Casa di Amore tied for a close second.  This place has the atmospere that many of the larger chains try so hard to achieve.  The in-house jazz band cranks out standards on specific nights of the week, but I'm not sure which nights they play.  Live music, great food and a friendly staff = A++	5	Nora's Italian Cuisine	4
Great restaurant!  Given the outdoor seating with a view of the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower, this place is a great after dark spot to hit during the summer.  I've had several entrees and desserts on the menu, and each item was amazing.  It's a little spendy, which is to be expected for any restaurant on the strip, but if you can manage to get an outdoor seat it's well worth it.  The seating is elevated from the strip, so it isn't like you have people walking by and sticking their heads in to have a look at your meal.  I would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a nice and memorable meal on the Strip.	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
Great place for noodles.  Most of the dishes are Thai in origin.  This place is one of my favorites whenever I have a random Sunday afternoon noodle craving.  It is a small place, and that fact lends it a certain level of uniqueness and character.  Everything I have had in this place is awesome, from the dishes to the drinks.  A++	5	Thai Style Noodle House	4
The food at this place is decent, but nothing special.  Among the various Chinese places I have been to on Spring Mountain, I don't think this place stacks up against Sam Woo or Joyful House.  The service was prompt and courteous, and the prices are good for what you get.  All the same, I probably won't be going back.	3	Anna's Garden	3.5
It seems like this place gets a bad rap, and perhaps it is for the right reasons, but I can only speak to an amazing noodle bowl I had while I was there.  It had some sort of round noodle, egg and tomato, with some light herbs and spices and a light sauce.  I was amazing.  If this place has take out I might go back there just for another bowl of that amazingness.  It's kinda tucked away in Caesar's, and the prices are a little high for what you get.  The service was rather slow and not very courteous.  I'll have to hit up this place again for a follow-up review.	4	Beijing Noodle No. 9	2.5
Great little spot for breakfast.  Fast courteous service and awesome food.  I had the Tuscan Farm Eggs.  Highly recommend you try these if you decide to give this one a try.	5	Grand Lux Cafe	4
Kerr'y is an excellent place to go for lunch.  The menu has a good selection, and the prices seem to be on par with every other place.  From the flyers they have posted on and around the door, it looks like Karaoke on the weekends gets pretty crazy.  The staff has been friendly every time I have been there, and the service is excellent.	4	Kerry's Sports Pub Pizza & Grill	3
I have been to this one several times now.  The sushi is great and the chefs are good and quick.  It offers an excellent menu, but if you are going for the all-you-can-eat option, you have to be aware of the one hour time limit.  Prices are reasonable, presentation is simple and the staff is friendly.  Definitely a gem in an otherwise dank-looking strip mall.	4	Sushi On Rainbow	3.5
Excellent food.  This place has a nice atmosphere and a menu that makes me wish it were closer to work so I could come here for lunch.  The two waitresses working the day I went both had noticable Italian accents.  The service was awesome and the prices were fair.  I will definitely be making future trips to this place.	5	Roma Deli 1 & Restaurant	4.5
I've been here four times and enjoyed every visit.  Good food, good service, good prices.  The menu is fairly diverse, but still features dishes you would find at just about any Mexican restaurant.  Good for a late night bite if you happen to be in the down town\/ Fremont St area.	5	Mamacita's Restaurant	3
Good breakfast spot.  Good food, even better when you consider the fact that it is relatively inexpensive.  I ordered smaller dishes of a few things on the menu just to get a cross section of the menu.  Everything was excellent, including the service.	5	The Maple Tree	3.5
Went there last night. The food was overpriced and bland. The food took forever to be brought out and it was cold. The server brought fajitas without tortillas. Who does that? Chili's has better fajitas than this place. It has a good location and that's how they stay in business. Avoid this place.	1	La Comida	3.5
Another great Mexican place in Vegas.  This little gem is tucked away in the Commercial Center.  It doesn't occur to you just how big this place is until you walk inside.  It features a full bar that occupies one wall of the restaurant and a dance floor in front of a stage that on certain nights has a full Mariachi band.  Service is prompt and courteous and prices are about on par with the majority of the other ones I have been to around town.  If you're down for hitting up the Mexican places around Vegas, I would highly recommend this one.	5	Las Palmas Mariachi Restaurant	3
Excellent food, service and atmophere.  Everything I would expect from another Wolfgang Puck installation.  I had the club sandwich with a salad and a beer.  Everything I ordered has its own subtlety and was not like every other place that serves something comparable.  The prices were reasonable for the quality of the meal.  I would definitely go back some time.	5	Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill Las Vegas	4
Stopped in here for a bite before a movie.  The bartender was entertaining and good for conversation,  as I would expect in any more spendy place like this one.  The sushi was excellent (Salmon Roll and Dragon Roll), but the beer selection was limited.  I shaved off one star due to the fact that it does not have any beers on tap.	4	Hachi	4
I went to this place after I discovered that Yard House almost requires a reservation for a seat at the bar on a Saturday night.  Almost every dish on the menu has overtones of something tropically influenced.  The service was excellent and the time to wait for the meal was reasonable.  The food itself was sweet in dishes where it didn't have to be (i.e.: the butter was infused with what seemed like cinnamon and sugar).	4	Tommy Bahama Restaurant | Bar | Store - Las Vegas	4
Without a doubt, the best cup of coffee I have had in a long time.  I wouldn't think there would be such a craft to brewing a cup of coffee, but this place does an amazing job.  Could organic coffee really make that big of a difference?  The staff was very friendly and helpful and the place has free Wi-Fi.  The owners of this place went a little further than most places in building an atmosphere using contrasting paint colors and art from local artists.  This is definitely one of my new favorite places to spend a Sunday morning.	5	Sunrise Coffee	4.5
The prospect of a slightly more gourmet burger joint seemed appealing, and when I saw the beer selection I knew I had to try this place.  I had the steakhouse burger with a Boddington's on one visit and the chicken fingers and a fat tire on the second.  Both occasions were awesome.  I hope to go back soon.	5	LBS Burger	3.5
Interesting little cross-section of old Vegas.  They have live music in the form of one guy on a keyboard playing a few standards and allow enough room in front of him that people can come out and dance to the tunes if they feel so inclined.  This place has a decent menu and a friendly staff, but might not be a place for the 20-30 crowd.  Nice all the same.	4	Ichabod's Lounge	4
Great diner with great diner food.  It is located in a seedy part of town, but the food is awesome and the place is open 24\/7.  The staff has always been friendly every time I have been there.  It isn't a glamorous place, but any time I have a hankerin' for some steak and eggs or other classis diner grub, this place is always a safe bet.  One more thing: this place only accepts cash, which can be a nasty surprise if you aren't looking for signs above the register.	5	Tiffany's Cafe	4
I have been to numerous Greek and Mediterrean restaurants, so at this point I have a good reference for what I should expect.  Overall, the food was good, as was the service and time to wait for the order.  More specifically, the food was good, but not any better than other places I have been that were more reasonably priced.  I am willing to dish it out for a nice meal, but the prices at this place seemed a little high considering what you are getting.  The outdoor seating they have at this place seems to be a favorite of a number of chain smokers, as the entire meal was complemented by the fragrant aroma of cigarette smoke.  The interior is... very Greek.  I unfortunately will not be going back to this place.	3	The Mad Greek Cafe	3
"I haven't eaten here, but I've definitely partied here.

LAVO has got to be the best place to be on Sunday nights- VICE Sundays. DJ Vice is the sh*t. Before heading out, my buddy asked me what his DJ style is like, and the best way I can describe it is high energy the whole time, except this last time when he rounded off the night with Drake\/The Weeknd's ""Crew Love.""

If you can get on a guestlist, you won't have to wait in line and can probably get in free, and girls can get free drinks until midnight.

Whatever your plans are for Sunday nights in Vegas, cancel them and go to LAVO."	5	LAVO Italian Restaurant & Lounge	3.5
"This is the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas so far, considering I don't normally wander too far from the strip. The bottom crust could be a bit more crisp, but when you're coming out of Marquee, it's just right there, and a couple of hot slices of pizza makes for the best night cap.

Best story about this place, a few friends and myself decided to get some pizza around midnight, and a few girls were coming out of Marquee. They see us eating pizza at a table in front of one of the other restaurants on this level and come up to us asking where we got this pizza. I point over to the general direction of the hallway that leads to the pizzeria, and she just gives me this look and says, ""Are you sure you didn't get it from here?"" pointing to the restaurant behind me, which is CLEARLY closed with the bars down and the servers counting down the registers. I'm pretty sure I did NOT get this pizza from a closed restaurant..."	4	Secret Pizza	4
Thank you Terry for your response and concern. I ended up waiting 35 min. And I only got my food because I went back up to the counter to see what the delay was. Then and only then did the cashier look through the orders he had sitting there waiting and find mine. Unfortunately by the time I got home my food was cold.	2	Island Sushi & Grill	4
This place was great. A little slow but it was really busy. The best sushi in Vegas!	4	Tokyo Japanese Restaurant	4
"Spend $50 or more and it gets you into the omini no line. 
Tapas:
Crab cakes: too salty, fishy & the crust was soggy.
Strawberry pecan salad: over priced
Habinero  Pepper & pickles: too briny with a kick of spice.
Bone marrow: nothing special, fatty oily marrow with onion jam over two tiny pieces of toast.

But getting into the club without waiting was nice."	2	Searsucker	4
"Authentic & great tasting poke, if you're craving something from the islands.

Many different combinations but my top 3 are the ahi spicy mayo, kimchi w raw tako, & ahi with Hawaiian sea salt, shoyu, & limu."	5	Poke Express	4.5
RA sushi is just all hype with no substance. Sushi rolls are not fresh or innovative, tastes are so sub par but their price does NOT reflect this standard. They should be ashamed for overcharging poor Vegas tourists who wants some decent sushi. We only went there because it's right across from the Wynn and we wanted to walk a around a bit afterwards. total Disgust! NEVER again! extremely loud music, come'on it's not a night club, it's just a sushi bar, a very poor one indeed. The overall cleanness is hard to tell due to how dark the dinning room is with red lights. Seriously trying to kill your eyesight with those disturbing lights. Service is a joke if you're in for sushi and no cocktails, slow and a bunch of ignorant snubby servers. Ok, Check please!	1	RA Sushi Bar Restaurant	3.5
This resturaunt shows so much hospitality. The owner is great, he actually walks around and makes sure customers are satisfied. The food itself is very flavorful. You can tell they focus on providing high quality food.	5	Taste - Homestyle Indian Kitchen	5
"Today, I visited Cafe Rio for a quick tortilla soup and left with the following:

1 Tortilla soup (yay!)
1 long, dark hair in the foil-wrapped tortilla that accompanied said tortilla soup (boo!)
20 minutes of my life gone waiting in the world's slowest line behind maybe 8 people
7 splatters of bleach on my custom-tailored VINCE sheath dress
0 stamps for my now-defunct stamp card, because I won't download their app

In case you're wondering, 75 is the number of tortilla soups I would need to eliminate from my diet to pay to replace the ruined dress. Which is definitely more than I've eaten in my life. So I'm pretty much never going back."	1	Cafe Rio	2.5
What sucks the most about this place is that they include their tip, even tho they have shitty service they are rude and get mad if you ask for something never coming back! Lesson learned look on yelp first!	1	Rock n Roll Sushi	3
Love this place. I make excuses to be on that side of town mid day so I can do the lunch buffet. Delicious. Wish I didn't get full so quickly. Went the first time with a visiting friend. We had the big sampler deal- took home two styro containers. It was even delicious cold the next day. Indian cuisine is not for everyone- but if you like it- you'll love Mt. Everest.	4	Mount Everest India's Cuisine	4.5
Why only 3 stars, guys?  I thought this  place was like a trip to Miami without the jet lag. Brought a Cuban food virgin along- we love it. The Bistek de Palomilla and the Old Man's Clothes (beef)- can't remember the Spanish name. Roja de Viejo or something like that. Both very tasty. The Yuca Frita was great too. Didn't have drinks at lunch, can't comment on that.	5	Havana Grill	3.5
"I love this buffet. Have done it three or four times now. Have taken folks right from McCarran. Especially love the small creamy polenta....how do they do that?

But here's the gripe...those are the most hideous uniforms I have ever seen on the female wait staff. Not one woman looked attractive in them...they seem to highlight everyone's worst feature! I can't imagine putting that on every day! Geez, beautiful place...give the staff attractive uniforms. IHOP has better outfits."	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
Even the Chinese buffet in Chadron, Nebraska was better than this. Don't even be tempted.	1	Buffet  Asia	2.5
Extremely overpriced. It's Mexican food, ok? Maybe I just had PMS or something- but I was out with a great group of folks and the food was just average. What blew my mind is when someone ordered an Irish Coffee after dinner- they charged her for the coffee and then for the Irish whiskey separately. That's like ordering a screwdriver and paying for an orange juice  and for a shot of vodka separately. Also, it was impossible to see it was dark. I'm amazed by all the five star reviews.	3	Javier's	4
I went there because they do a gf crust. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful. The pizza was delicious and cheesy. The edges of the cuts were a little burnt, but I guess that is due to the 800 degree oven. Good atmosphere. I would go again. Only four stars due to crust edges.	4	800 Degrees	3.5
Food was good. We had the grilled chicken tacos. We ate outside and watched the fountains.   The pico was great, pass on salsa. I had a coconut margarita that was good, but was 26!$. My husband's drink was 28$!  Watch out. $$$. Buy the tic tonight deal before you go. Service was great.	4	Cabo Wabo Cantina	3.5
"Having been to New Orleans many times, I find this the best Creole Restaurant outside of the French Quarter.
We made a last minute reservation, and although the place was full, they had an overflow area that we ended up in.  It was quiet and we loved the atmosphere.
Will go back during our next visit, and also try the larger restaurant in Summerlin."	5	Lola's A Louisana Kitchen	4
"Wow.. I don't even know how to begin.
We had looked forward to going here for weeks.
We arrived early, and were told no tables were available, and headed to the bar for a drink or two.
The minute we walked into the bar, there was someone on a loudspeaker that was so loud we could not even hear each other talk.
Come to find out, they had rented out the upstairs to a group, and it was awful.  The minute the idiot on the loudspeaker would stop, they would turn up the tv's to the same volume.
So after 10 minutes of torture, the bartender came over....Said he couldn't do anything about the volume.  We asked him if he could see if there was a table available away from the previously mentioned idiot on the loudspeaker.
Came back after a bit and said no go on the table.
So, we gave up and walked out.  On the way past about seven empty tables, we informed the lady up front we were leaving and the reason, she looked put out and said that she could go ahead and seat us.
Too little...too late."	1	Rhythm Kitchen	3.5
"This is probably one of the most expensive restaurants in Vegas - My appetizer alone was $21.00 for some under cooked risotto (Wild Matsutake Mushroom Risotto, Parmesan Reggiano).  I can make BETTER risotto at home.  I did not bother to complain because I knew there was no point - I just had to survive through my next entree.  My husband had Ravioli with Ricotta, Spinach & Soft Quail Egg, Grilled Quail and Thyme Glaze - it was OK with alot of holiday seasoning.

My dinner entree was Grilled Prime New York Sirloin, Yukon Gold-Horseradish Potatoes, Cognac-Mustard Sauce - $54.00.  I can honestly say the steak was seasoned perfectly and the cognac-mustard sauce was excellent.  My husband had Slow Braised Beef Short Ribs, Creamy Polenta, Olives, Shallots and Natural Juices - not bad either...but then again, how can you screw up short ribs?? Just braise it to death and you'll be OK.

Service was exceptional - don't bother filling up on free bread, try to enjoy your expensive entrees because I didn't finish half my steak and didn't want to carry a doggy bag around :(  

A glass of wine really wasn't a ""glass of wine"" they poured short of 1\/2  a cup a glass...but then again, foo-foo diners don't care when they are carrying wads of money with them.

Skip over to the Gelato stand right next to the restaurant for a cheaper dessert and PLEASE bring your American Express card for this place - don't leave home without it!

If it wasn't for my birthday - I would of gone next door to Enoteca ( I heard their food was great!)."	3	Postrio	3.5
"Free HOT baguette and butter to spread and shredded carrot salad - what more can you asked for?!

Service was good for a busy night  - most of the waiters had very strong spanish accents, so please listen carefully!

Ambiance was relaxed and less stuffy than the other fine dining restaurants which I liked.

Our endive salad with blue cheese and pear did not include the pear...but half way through the salad, I couldn't complain but that's a tsk tsk on them!

MY sea scallops was ok - not the best I had but my husband had one of the daily special fish dishes that was much better.

Lastly, our waiter came by with a free dessert for my birthday - kudos to that!"	3	Mon Ami Gabi	4
Martha was Amazing! We love the music from CH Jerry Nash also.. Thank you so much for the hospitality and great bottle service deals. Definitely coming back tomorrow	5	Luna Lounge	4
This place is ammaaazzzeeballllss! I had the bone in filet mignon, to DIE for! The mac & cheese, pigs in blanket, Ahi and their beautiful beverages! Not a bad thing about this place for me, simply amazing. And the dessert! Oh my.. try the raspberry filled donuts, you will melt. highly recommend this place.	5	Stack Restaurant & Bar	4
I love their margaritas with the 2 beers sticking out! Only thing I didn't like about the place was how dark it was, being in the Luxor is just like that, an outside patio would of made it great! I was too involved with my beverage to really take in the food, but I remember it being exceptional. Nice servers as well! Give it a shot :)	4	T&T - Tacos & Tequila	3.5
Exceptional evening at this unassuming spot way off the strip.  In the private room our group  enjoyed the white pizza, Caesar salad, veal Marsala, carbonara, chicken parm and cannelloni.  Service was spot one..not too intrusive, well timed and friendly without being obsequious.  Traditional Italian dine extremely well.	5	Nora's Italian Cuisine	4
A new favorite, Mint delivered with a great beer list, extensive menu and delicious food,  This is another almost hidden gem and feels worlds away from the overpriced hotel restaurants,  Our group of four loved the samosa, saag paneer, butter chicken and shrimp curry,  The menu is very diverse and next time I will be more adventurous,  The buttered garlic Naan was awesome.	4	Mint Indian Bistro	4
Really disappointed with the service and attitude here.  We had a group of eight and were ready to enjoy the evening but surly waiter and lack of service was awful.  Drinks never got refilled and no one even asked if we wanted more,  several dishes never arrived, and when we were told our waiter was on  a break, he was across the restaurant with another group.  There were at least two other large groups that arrived after we did who were served well before us.  The dumplings and   beef were great but that was not enough to save the experience	1	Beijing Noodle No. 9	2.5
Had a great lunch here.  The Lunch box with sweet corn soup, chopped salad and warm mini doughnuts was yummy and not too much food,  love the decor of this spot.  One of the more reasonably priced spots at the Wynn\/Encore	5	Society Cafe Encore	4
It's all about the food here!  Service is mediocre, decor pretty mundane and the location kind of creepy but the food more than makes up for it.  Our table of six enjoyed the stuffed chicken wings, dumplings, curries and drunken noodles.  They feature an extensive wine list as well.  If you can get reservations....GO,	4	Lotus of Siam	4
Awesome dinner in a strip club...not really in the club but in the building.  service was outstanding and everyone of us loved the carne asada and carnitas.  I'd go back just for quest fundido with mushrooms alone,  really enjoyed the experience.	4	El Dorado Cantina	4
This place is awesome, too bad I was pretty hungover when I ate here.  From what I can tell though the sushi is fresh and tasty.  They also tasted pretty authentic and not the bastardized type you can find in other low end sushi joints.  Too bad my stomach wasn't feeling that great so I wasn't able to fully appreciate the "all you can eat" aspect of the restaurant.  I'd definitely come back the next time I visit Vegas.	4	Sushi House Goyemon	3.5
Love this place.  I ate here one night when most restaurants were already closed except for the nasty cafe places at the hotels.  I was pleasantly surprised by the back area with the small stage and beautiful murals on the wall.  The waiter and the hostess had thick Irish accents which to me were a good sign that the food is pretty authentic (unless they were faking it).  Service was very friendly... food and drinks were great... ambiance was terrific... can't ask for anything more.	5	Rí Rá Irish Pub	4
Best steakhouse EVER.  The decor and ambiance of the restaurant could be spruced up a bit but the steak more than makes up for the negatives.  I ordered the rib eye and that first bite was just orgasmic...  The steak was perfectly seasoned with such an amazing flavor that just melted in my mouth.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.  My friend ordered the New York and that was just as good.  Definitely a place to visit while in Vegas.  Ask for some horseradish on the side as well.  They were the strongest horseradish I've ever had in my life but so so good.	5	Gallagher's Steakhouse	4
Blah.  This might be a good place to go if you're drunk and don't care about the quality of sushi you're eating but if you're sober and is somewhat coherent about what you're putting in your mouth then don't come here.  I ordered the sashimi plate and what came out were these poorly cut tiny pieces of fish on top of giant mounds of shredded daikon.  Sashimi is all about the way the fish is cut and whoever cut these pieces were either highly untrained in sushi making or wanted to save the restaurant some money by using the end pieces of the available fish.  Terrible.  Oh and the red lighting of the place gave me a headache.	1	RA Sushi Bar Restaurant	3.5
Bleh.  For the price that you're paying, the food and service you get just isn't worth it.  I came here in a party of 9 so I was able to taste a variety of different foods and nothing really stood out.  Probably the best thing I had was the grilled asparagus but that was just that... grilled asparagus.  The rock grilled steak or whatever they called it was too gimicky for my taste.  Yes, the hot rock gave a nice sizzle and sear over the first steak slice you put on it but afterwards, the rock loses a lot of heat really quickly thus cooking the remaining slices unevenly.  The sweet and sour calamari appetizer tasted like something that came out of Panda Express.  I tried a little bit of the duck and it was nothing special.  The flavors were all jumbled together and I couldn't even taste the duck.  Same thing can be said of the filet mignon that I ordered.  First of all I ordered it medium rare but it arrived medium.  Like the duck, it was just a jumbled mess of flavors that really masked the meat itself.  The worst part of the meal however wasn't the food but the uneven arrival of the dishes.  Our appetizers came out really quickly but then there was a horrendously long wait to get our main courses (something around 45 minutes)....  That was just ridiculous and unacceptable.  Never again!	2	Japonais	3.5
I used to like this place.  USED TO.  I really did...  But the last time I went here I was extremely disappointed.  For thirty-something dollars per person, I could've gotten a better meal elsewhere.  I used to like this place because they had some pretty high-quality and tasty dishes but during this last visit, everything seemed to have gone downhill.  Maybe it's due to the economy but you can definitely tell that quality has been sacrificed.  The meat you get from the carving table was dry and tough.  Presentation of dishes were a mess since food was strewn all over the place and nobody seemed to care about cleaning the little messes.  Oh and the crab.... Such horror...  I didn't even dare to touch it because they were gray in color and looked like they've been refrozen multiple times.  Such a shame because this used to be one of my favorite buffets.	1	Le Village Buffet	3
I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Being located in Vegas, I wasn't expecting much out of a dim sum restaurant but this place really delivers.  Yes, there are better places in California but if you're craving dim sum and you're in Vegas, this is a great place to go.	4	Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant	3.5
I don't understand why this place is getting these great reviews.  The burger I had (the Black Jack) was extremely bland and tasteless.  I don't think they seasoned the meat!  My 2 other companions felt the same way.  Did the kitchen run out of salt and pepper that day??  I'm not sure but I don't think I'll be coming back.  I'm only giving this place two stars because of good service and their beer selection.	2	Burger Bar	4

"Gourmet fast food burgers.  Thick, well seasoned beef patties, and topics above and beyond what you'll find at your regular burger joint.  But then it's mashed together in a foil wrapper so when you go to eat it you have that familiar fast food experience of the smashed bun and melted cheese all over the paper.  (this is not a good thing...lol)

The onion rings are HUGE and amazingly tasty.  They look the size of a chunky, bangle bracelet.  They, and other sides (fries and such), are a steal at $4 for a plentiful order.  Which almost makes up for the burgers being dang close to $10.  Sheesh.  

Service can be spotty esp if it's late at night...be prepared for a little wait, it's not always as ""fast"" as promised.  But, it's delicious and worth it."	4	Bobby's Burger Palace	4
The linguine carbonara is one of the best dishes I've had in my life.  Thick, fresh made noodles....chunks of bacon....just rich, buttery pasta goodness.  We had excellent service and the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food we received.  I loved it here.	5	Cucina by Wolfgang Puck	4
HUGE slices!  They have combo specials with a garlic knot and a drink but the single slice was more than enough to fill me up.  I was happy to see a spinach and artichoke pizza, because that's my favorite and not something every pizza joint keeps on hand by the slice.  Check in on yelp and get a free beer!  Best check in offer I've come across yet! :)	3	Pin-Up Pizza	4
Where do I start?? In a word it was AWFUL.....we got the $25 mac & cheese appetizer, which wouldn't be enough food for my 9 year old nephew. I then asked the waiter if the bacon burger was good & his exact words were, "it's a burger". That should have been my first clue not to order this $23 overpriced meal. It was over cooked & small. In N Out Burger would have been MUCH  better at $4 for a double cheeseburger! I HIGHLY recommend avoiding this horrible restaurant.	1	Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill	3.5
Cheaper than the other Filipino restaurants yet the food are very yummy and so many selections.  The place is spacious for large gatherings. Very friendly environment. Best place for a quick lunch!	4	DJ Bibingkahan	3.5
Today was my first visit to Kneaders I tried going into weeks ago but the line was out the door now I know why. I was just going in to get some bread and rolls and got a croissant sandwich to go everything was delicious since this was my second visit it will definitely not be my last the food is out of this world	5	Kneaders Bakery & Cafe	3.5
On a long walk with the wife and we ducked in here.  SUPER friendly waiter named Brian.  Excellent service,  great breakfast (Top sirloin and eggs w\/ sourdough and potatoes) for $7.95.  Coffee was good too.  I even asked to speak to the manager so I could let him know how happy we were with the food and especially the service.  He was very gracious and saw him give our waiter a "thatta boy".  Not one negative.	5	Planet Hollywood	2.5
"My favorite late night joint on the strip, hands down. 

Why I love this place:
1. Convenient location
2. Open late
3. Home style cooking (even the chefs are Asian)
4. I've never had to wait to be seated
5. Fast and friendly service
6. Decent prices for being on the strip

I usually get the congee (rice porridge) with thousand year old egg. It warms the soul :)"	5	Noodle Asia	3.5
"What happened, Mario Batali?

Food: My burger was wrapped in brown paper like it was from a fast food joint - you can taste like a classic burger without looking like crap. My friend also ordered chicken wings that didn't quite taste right.

Service: Our waitress was attentive, but the rest of the wait staff was sooo poorly trained! It's as if B&B decided to only hire kids with zero work experience."	2	B&B Burger & Beer	3
I used to be the duchess of Dickey's Pleasanton. I can't wait to be the duchess of Dickey's Las Vegas! This location has a great set up, but the service is something to be said for. Every employee is super warm & welcoming as well as very knowledgable about the menu. Portions were very generous and I loved how custom the brand has become.	4	Dickey's Barbecue Pit	3.5
"On any other day I'd probably give this place a 3.5 but I'm feeling generous.

They seated our group of 7 right away, service was fast, and the food was solid. The wait staff and kitchen staff are mainly Chinese (something I look for at a Chinese establishment).

The wall decor and fish tanks are a little trippy and distracting.

Prices are okay, considering you're in Vegas. Make sure you bring your Total Rewards card for discounted pricing.

Dishes I liked:
Green onion pancake
Spicy cubed chicken
Congee w\/ thousand year old egg and pork

Dishes that were decent:
Beef brisket noodle soup
Hainanese chicken and rice"	4	Beijing Noodle No. 9	2.5
"Ugh, should have checked Yelp before I came here, what was I thinking?! I'm going to keep it short and say that this restaurant is definitely not worth coming to. For starters, its not the most sanitary place. Sanitation is something I take very seriously in the food industry. The plates and cups still had food articles on it after sitting down and looking at my plates & utensils. 

Secondly, the food here was NOT GOOD. There is no other way to put it. Everything had way too much salt on it causing it to have no flavor."	1	Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant	2
"I've only been here for happy hour so I can't say too much. The food, eh! We had the queso with chicken and there was about one piece of diced chicken for i think $2 extra, that was a ripoff! The drinks here are pretty good for happy hour and they have it from 4-6 and 9-close (I think those are the hours)

What keeps me coming back is the wonderful location has, and you can be asked to be seated along the water and watch tourists take the gondola ride!"	3	Cañonita	4
"Yard House seems to be everywhere I go. It's undeniable that their plethora of options makes it a desirable place for lunch or dinner. I wasn't feeling a majority of the items and decided to order the Korean BBQ beef appetizer since it came with a little bit of veggies, grains, and meat. The entire meal was great until I discovered a raw piece of beef on my plate (see attached photo). 

Hope they aren't serving all their guests raw meat!"	2	Yard House	4
Man, I was disappointed considering this place had an average of 4 stars! I frequently visit Yi-Mei and Noodle Pot so maybe I have already found the gem's of Chinatown\/Taiwanese food. The beef noodle soup is ok, but there was only one noodle choice. We also got the pork rice plate. Another Yelper also wrote this and we had the same problem...isn't that pork supposed to be fried on a rice plate? It wasn't a deal breaker but just a little strange. The food was just so-so and our table was dirty when we sat down. This place needs to be seen by the health dept and needs more sanitizer in their sanitizer bucket.	3	Taiwan Kitchen	3.5
Everyone needs to be aware that this place is SMALL. I think even using the word small is inaccurate, but tiny. Absolutely no waiting area, so you have to wait inside, the place is crammed, and the parking lot itself isn't that big either. I had their miso ramen, which was yummy, but salty. The pork served in it....to die for! This place would be a lot better if they simply had more space! The good thing is that they are opening a new location next year in Green Valley! Yay.	3	Monta Ramen	4
"Teriyaki House is a family owned fast casual restaurant in Southwest LV. You can get all kinds of teriyaki from chicken to salmon, and more. I love that everything is made to order so everything is fresh. I also love the bento box set-up that you're getting more than just rice with your meal. Who doesn't love some fresh veggies on a hot summer day in Vegas? 

The owner is super personable and friendly - making you want to return ASAP!"	4	Teriyaki House	4.5
"Shout out to Ricky for reminding me why I LOVE dining here! 

The night started a bit slow when we had to wait a little after our reservation time and it took a while for us to get our first glasses of water, but Ricky was nothing short of attentive and filled our glasses without us having to ask first.

New review on the new\/revised menu items:
1) Alaskan Cod: fluffy, white fish cooked to perfection. It's served with a buttered crostini that crunch-ily melts in your mouth.
2) The Spencer Steak: This was on the menu before, I had just never tried it. This, I kid you not, was the best steak ribeye I've had to date. Perfectly charred, juicy, with a flawless pink center.
3) Hawaiian Ahi Poke: First time trying this menu item. I can be weird about my raw fish, but this. was. stellar. Not overly saucy and served with the perfect amount of seaweed and cucumber. Tasted like it had been marinating for days! I didn't lose any flavor as I bit into it.
4) Portabello fries: still bomb.com

Stellar service and even more spectacular food...hope to make it to Echo and Rig's brunch soon!"	5	Echo & Rig	4.5
"Awwww Yelper's! Ya'll are letting me down! I'm sad to say that I was disappointed in the food here but the drinks here were SUPERB.

For the price of dinner, I felt that Olives really could have done better. I had the rib-eye which was yummy but totally didn't understand the potato chip garnish, really??

Secondly, the mushroom risotto is not mushroom risotto but mushroom FLAVORED extra watery rice, I was not a fan.

The servers, drinks, and location are fabulous which is what lead me to my four star review."	4	Olives	4
I wish I knew what the hype was about! Don't get me wrong, this is a GREAT place to come after a night at the club when you want something to eat (thank god its 24\/7) but I wouldn't say that this is the best quality pho I've had. Am I ordering the wrong thing? I didn't think I could go wrong order pho at a restaurant with PHO in the name of the restaurant. The decor is a lot nicer than traditional pho places but the service can be really slow and I feel like there is ALWAYS a wait here. So even though the hours here are great, I think I would only find myself coming here when the other places are closed.	3	Pho Kim Long	3.5
"Pide. Lahmacun. Kebabs. Döner. Fresh Pita. Kunefe. Need I say more?

Maza know's what they're doing! It looks a little rough around the edges (they were repainting the exterior when I went) but the inside dining room is gorgeous! They have three salt water fish tanks (easy entertainment for children) and an area where live music plays on some nights. 

I wish I knew the name of the gal that was serving us but the food has taken over my brain. She was awesome! Very attentive to our needs and always made sure we had our glasses filled.

The food was ON POINT. I would describe each item we had but that means this review would be forever long and I'd be repeating myself because everything was PERFECT. The pide was flawlessly soft and the döner was flat out delicious. We had heaping handfuls of leftovers due to their generous portions and our server was so kind to label what each of the boxes contained, so we easily knew how to distribute at the end of the evening.

I don't regret anything I ate, but I'm pretty sure I had a food hangover the next day, so be sure to head over here when you're hungry!"	5	Maza Mediterranean Grill & Lounge	4
"Sadly, Sambalatte is overpriced. However, their priceless ambiance makes it worth it. The decor and small details gives an ordinary coffee shop a large personality. 

I've had the Nutella latte and the Nutella hot chocolate but personally think that the hot cocoa had more flavor. The latte lacked the Nutella flavor IMO.

Restrooms are clean, hours are pretty good, and the location is in an awesome complex. I'm excited for them to be opening their second location at Monte Carlo!"	4	Sambalatte Torrefazione	4
"I would consider Sammy's to be a standard pho restaurant. Nothing special but really good on a cold rainy day. 

Service as usual is quick since most things are pre made. I ordered to go and thought it was kind of strange for them to serve the rare beef raw in a separate container. 

I would return, but this wouldn't be my first choice."	3	Sammy Pho Vietnamese Cuisine	3

"RIP Pool Party Season 2013. Encore Beach Club is a GORGEOUS venue. Gorgeous people, beautiful fake palm trees, bright orange day beds, and awesome DJ's! 

The biggest downfall is the staff. They are rude, condescending, and do NOT understand the definition of ""hospitality"" 

Sadly, they know people will come regardless due to the popularity of the venue and find reasons to be jerks. 

NOTE to Encore Beach Club management: if the pool is slow on a Friday, please take the sticks out of your asses and allow reentry."	4	Encore Beach Club	4
"Minus one star for paying for my chips and the cashier not giving them to us.

The staff here does a great job at explaining the different sandwich sizes by detailing the amount of meat that goes into each particular size. All of the sandwiches here are unique in their own way from offering items like pineapple, or cream cheese. Me and my +1 shared the Pig Kahuna and were stuffed! The sandwich was full of flavor (with a nice kick from the tabasco sauce) Note: These sandwiches are served open faced, don't plan on folding it or it'll fall apart because there's so much meat!

Though their hours aren't the most Vegas friendly, Beach Hut Deli offers a true ""beachy"" experience with their décor and menu options. I definitely plan on returning to make my way down the menu!

PS. They have several beer options if you're feeling particularly thirsty."	4	Beach Hut Deli	4
"I guess this place deserves another review\/chance since it does say I have two check ins here after I said that my return factor was only 50%. The only purpose for my second visit was for a friends 21st birthday party after a guy working there (who will rename unnamed) said that we could get a table with 8 girls on a Sunday night. Keep in mind: we are all locals and Sunday IS industry night. 

So, he SAID we could get a comped table, the day of said no problem (at 5pm) and at 8pm decided to bail out. No apology and no reason. 

We decided to go in anyways cause by that time it was too late to get on a guest list anywhere else. And man, the line was much longer than it was opening day. After waiting what seemed like an eternity I'm glad the staff or management had a change of heart cause I didn't have to pretend I was in work-out clothes hiking up four flights of stairs, they let us take the elevator!! (yay)

My experience here the second time was a LOT more fun. Probably because I came with a big group of pretty gal's and we were able to swoop in on some tables. Jk, but seriously. I think they were also able to work out some of the kinks and everything just seemed to go a lot smoother. Hosts were ""recruiting"" girls into more exclusive areas which made the experience a lot more memorable.

One thing that really confuses me is all of the other nice nightclubs in Vegas have toiletries for girls - perfume, tissues, deodorant if necessary. Hakkasan had none of these..and for a nightclub that is trying to run XS out of business, you are not doing a very good job. (Just saying)

Hakkasan Las Vegas is doing a lot better now than they were doing in April but can still use some improvement. I have another friend who is visiting in July and is DYING to see Calvin Harris so stay tuned for another review..hopefully it will be four stars the next time around."	3	Hakkasan Nightclub	2.5
"Container park was cool to see, but nothing special. The concept is neat and a great place for kids or families to hang out, but how are these restaurants and bars different from the places down the street? It's definitely a safer environment than the Fremont Street Experience but Container Park belongs in a better part of Vegas. 

I don't see the value in paying to park and hang out here. Yes, people may come here for a drink or two but who wants to go somewhere to relax with a park of screaming kids? On the other side, how is it responsible for adults to bring their kids here for a play-date if they are going to be intoxicated? 

Food for thought, but for now I'll continue hanging out at Town Square."	3	Downtown Container Park	4
"Personally, I think this place is overpriced. When I look back, it's Vegas...so nothing is really overpriced. I loved that the servers here were totally relaxed and were not pushy to order anything in particular.

**Tip: Get the toffee bread pudding...it is the best waste of calories ever! :)"	4	Public House	3.5
"I've had Rollin Smoke on my bookmarks for over two years. Finally got to roll on over! Had to roll myself out, too.

We had the pulled piggy sandwich plate and the brisket three ways. We had the mac n cheese and the corn nuggets for our sides. The food was FANTASTIC.
-Pulled piggy sandwich was perfectly smoky and had comparably less fat to other establishments I've been to that have served pulled pork sandwiches.
-Chopped brisket: juicy due to being a bit fattier than my preference, but served like it's supposed to
-Burnt ends: my personal favorite
Sliced brisket: perfectly tender and ready to pull apart
-Corn nuggets: YES PLEASE. I'd eat these all day long if calories didn't count.

Two things I would change about Rollin Smoke if I could: the location (super small parking lot) and the seating arrangements. Unfortunately we came on a really cold day and the seating area is rather sparse. This resulted in the doors opening and closing a lot, so our food got cold pretty quickly.

Verdict: I do NOT plan on waiting another two years to return, so you shouldn't either."	5	Rollin Smoke Barbeque	4.5
YUM!!! From the outside, it looks like its a restaurant with waiter service from all the outdoor seating. My first time here I discovered that it was actually an order and sit down! I really enjoyed eating here. First of all, the sweet pork was SO delicious!! Flavorful, tender, and flat out delicious. I really like how when ordering, you watch everything that they put on or into whatever you are eating. When we ordered our nachos, they slapped on a ton of cheese and put it through the  toaster which I loved. some places give it to you where some of it still has cold cheese on it! I would totally come back to try the other things on the menu!	4	Cafe Rio	3
"PROS:
     Portions - you could easily share with someone if you aren't into leftovers 
     Hours - open late! 
     Quality of food - everything I had here was delicious. The better half did a ""pick two"" with the shrimp and Hawaiian pork and I had the chicken katsu. We would have ordered more if we weren't stuffed with leftovers in hand  already.

CONS: 
     Service - very wishy washy depending on the staff working that day. One of the girls is extremely friendly while one of the other servers always has a confused look on her face and doesn't bother asking if you'd like the green salad or macaroni salad, which I think are extremely different and can make or break a meal. 

VERDICT: 
     While the service here sucks, the quality of food (taste and portions) will keep me coming back when I'm in the area."	4	Island Flavor	4.5

You know you've eaten somewhere fabulous when you're itching to write a review while your man is driving you home after such a great meal! 

Tacos y tacos is a clean, authentic taco shop that offers a variety of meats including the typical carne asada and al pastor to the tripas, lengua, and cabeza. 

The staff here is REALLY friendly and everything is made to order - including the corn tortillas. Be sure to tip the jar at each station because they are very patient and helpful to the new folks. 

I'll have to come back to review the other items they offer but I'm sure they won't disappoint!"	5	Taco Y Taco	4
"So happy we stumbled upon this place! Our server, Bruce was extremely friendly and welcoming. He gave us the rundown and introduced us to the very extensive menu. 

I had the Chicken Marsala - SUPER juicy and tender meat, I was not expecting that.
Mom had the Clam Linguine - Super generous amounts of seafood. Tons of muscles and scallops!
Boyfriend had the spaghetti and meatballs - you can pay an additional fee for an italian sausage. We opted not to get it, but they threw it in accidentally! 

When Bruce saw the sausage that was thrown in, he immediately looked at our order that he initially wrote down and apologized for the extra, why apologize! I was very pleased to see that he was willing to owe up to a mistake if he did make one.

Overall, it was an extremely extremely pleasant experience and I will definitely return. The only downside to this place, they haven't extended to California yet!!"	5	Carrabba's Italian Grill	3.5
"Archi's has a lot of awards! Constantly recognized by Zagat, I wasn't surprised when the food was excellent. Large portions, accurate spicy level across the board, but a long painful wait on a Friday night :( 

Be prepared to take home leftovers!"	4	Archi's Thai Bistro	4
"Le Thai completely exceeded my expectations. It's smack dab in the middle of  Fremont so I couldn't imagine dining here on a Friday or Saturday night but I came here on a weekday afternoon and it was spectacular! I was a little skeptical at first simply based off of the the small size of the restaurant (the outside patio area is huge!) The misters did a great job at keeping us cool. 

For starters, our server, Trelysa greeted us immediately with water and let us know the happy hour specials. We ordered the Larb Salad and the Pad See Ewe. Both were bursting with flavor and the portions were just right. 

When dining out, I'm a huge advocate of receiving a great service. Rarely ever even in Vegas where it is a Hospitality hub) does this happen. Le Thai thrives in both food and service. Can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu!"	5	Le Thai	4
"I LOVE mediterranean food. Stephano's is one of the best things to hit the University area. $2 beers for rebel hours, all day everyday! It's not super greasy (aka better than pizza and burgers for college students). Food is AMAZING and portions are huge. Either leave here feeling stuffed, share a plate with someone, or leave with leftovers!

The fries with sauce and the lamb\/beef gyro are my favorite. Be sure to request some extra tzatziki!"	5	Stephano's Greek & Mediterranean Grill	4
Ugh, this place is EXPENSIVE. The frozen hot chocolate is something that you should do once in your life for the experience but the food here is all standard american food you can get anywhere else for a fraction of the price!	3	Serendipity 3	3
"Ugh, it hurts my heart to leave a three star review but as much as I love Hawaii, Roy's is really just ""ok"" in my opinion. 

Lets start here: the food was great but the service was really lacking personality. We came in pretty early, around 6pm and our server was nowhere to be found so another server did the diligence of saying ""I'm free, let me take your order."" From then on, we still never saw our server. Thanks to the food runners & bussers who were taking care of us. Near the tail end of the meal we ordered two desserts and only one appeared at the table. We finally flagged down our server and it seems like he just forgot. 5 minutes later, dessert came, cool, they even comped one of them, not complaining. For some reason, I just felt like Roy's didn't live up to the 4.5 stars Yelp gave it. 

See ya Roy's, I'll probably try Morton's next time."	3	Roy's Restaurant	4.5
"Ugh...I wish I could say I liked this place more since I was here to see Kaskade!! Unfortunately, this place just didn't do it for me. I appreciate their efforts of re-entry but I'm afraid to say that it makes the place WAY too crowded. A couple of other concerns tao...
1. I didn't like the hip hop room and thought it was rather awkward 
2. Why are there tables in the hallway\/walkway area? What's the point of that...you can't see anything! 
3. Every bathroom I used was gross and dirty (in my opinion) no toilet seat covers, etc. 
4. Way too many Asians 
5. Lastly, I was told by multiple employees that Kaskade would start his set at 1. That was a lie. (Boo) 

Sorry Tao, I'd rather spend my night somewhere else"	2	Tao Nightclub	3
"Fact: This is the home of Guinness' largest chocolate fountain! What happened to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory?

I've had a variation of things here: savory crepes (merrrr), almond croissant (yum), creme brulee (so decadent and creamy), mango gelato (which in my opinion tastes more like passion fruit) and I am quite a fan. I think that Bouchon probably has a larger variation of sweets but Jean Phillippe makes and designs higher quality products. I think the location and set-up of Jean Phillippe just a little bit better."	4	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
"Pizza Rock had been on my list for a while, and I'm so glad I finally made it over here! The Downtown location is huge, and convenient for those who are on the go and just want to try a slice.

We dined in and were able to try a variety of tastings such as the meatballs, fried green beans, garlic bread, and of course, pizza! The meatballs were on point and went perfectly with the garlic bread. I don't feel like I have a fair judgement on the pizza because I was so stuffed by the time we were done with the appetizers! 

Overall a really great location and I would definitely return, maybe to Henderson, since it's a bit closer for me."	4	Pizza Rock	4
"Love this location! Great service, lots of room in the happy hour area and consistency. The host stand is in a little awkward of a spot but everything else makes up for it. 

PS. It's in the same complex as a Panera, Target, and Total Wines. Could it get any better??!"	4	The Cheesecake Factory	3.5
"Like most places in Vegas, KoMex is in a random little strip mall. We ordered the tacos, bulgogi burrito, and fettuccine chow mein. All of them were good, but nothing blew my mind. 

The tacos were probably my first choice of what I would order if I were to go back.
The burrito second. It was good, but the bulgogi wasn't as flavorful and wasn't nearly as saucy as I was expecting.
The noodles (to me) were the most disappointing, so we took these to go after our meal. I personally thought these tasted better as leftovers.

I do like the complimentary chips & salsa (though this is purely mexican and not korean at all)

KoMex has a great concept going, but I believe that their large menu leaves a lot of room for improvement. I'd like to see them narrow down the items they offer, and improve on those."	3	KoMex Fusion	4.5
Just a local breakfast joint that's really moderately priced for large portions! It has a great location being off Eastern but it's too sad that the place is small, causing the place to be really loud on a busy morning. Really cute décor and loved my standard eggs, hash browns, toast, and bacon. Can't wait to come back to explore the more unique menu items!	5	Griddlecakes	3.5
"Alas, I have made it to IS SWEET! I originally came here for a crepe cake and was able to try the green tea crepe cake. I've seen previous reviews about them running out, but I came by around 10pm on July 4th and they still had some. Not sure if they've started making more since they opened.

I couldn't help but return the next day for a honey toast after seeing the pictures on Yelp! Both items were delicious, and came out pretty quickly (the sign on the door says it will take at least 15 minutes for the honey toast, ours came out faster).

I'd definitely return for both items and am on a mission to try their drinks next!"	4	Is Sweet	4
"Note: This is for the nightclub only! 

1. LAVO needs a separate restaurant and nightclub business page
2. Apparently, Sunday is a ""neon theme."" This nightclub gave me deja vu  of my 8th grade promotion dance. That might sound harsh but the music was horrible rap that personally, gave me a headache. 
3. The bartender that was making our drinks was rude.
4. This place is TINY and not well built in my opinion. I get that its a nightclub so you are supposed to feel like you are in a tight, enclosed space but that doesn't mean the venue is actually supposed to be the size of a bedroom in NYC. I wasn't there for that long cause I couldn't take the music but I only saw one bar which was extremely crowded. Around the bar were ""tables"" which was really just a booth style seating with no privacy because thats the only pathway to get around the bar. 

Additionally, if I were dining in the restaurant I really wouldn't want people leaving and entering the nightclub to be walking above me with the chance of someone who had one too many sips of alcohol to hurl over the balcony when walking in or out of the club."	1	LAVO Italian Restaurant & Lounge	3.5
"I tried Pink's a couple of years ago...I had it again recently and was extremely disappointed. I remembered it tasting so much better! While the portions are large, you question the integrity of the concept...my+1 who accompanied me on this trip made some really good points! The first questioning if Kim K would ever actually be caught eating a hot dog. These days, celebrities are most known for the latest and greatest juice cleanse. Food for thought. 

Sorry Pink's, you'll need to step your game up or I'm waiting in line for Earl's next time."	2	Pink's Hot Dogs	3
"Ohhhh Grimaldi's. I was looking forward to trying you!! I think that Grimaldi's is a solid pizza joint if you are someone that is into the thin crust. I love doughy chewy pizza crust so I was a little caught off guard by the crispy crust. 

I found that the food here is really good but the service is really lacking, hence my three star review. I was found numerous times in my dining experience with empty water and beer and wine glasses that were waiting to be refilled. 

***Do NOT come here after 3:45pm-4:30pm or you won't be able to get any pizza!! I guess at this time, all Grimaldi's locations shut down the pizza oven to work some magic with the coals and what not."	3	Grimaldi's Pizzeria	4
"Nom nom nom nom nom. My mouth is watering. I think I'm due for a review too after eating here like everyday in November after discovering. My mom visited in March and we THOUGHT about going here but were sketchy about the cash only policy.  I have seriously missed out since then because i LOVE this place. The first time I came here my mom and I shared the beef noodle soup and the won ton soup. Both were so amazing with lots of fresh cilantro and green onion! 

It's def not a fancy place but this place has super great and flexible hours. I think they are open until 2am on Friday\/Saturday. This is the perfect place to go on a chilly Vegas night!"	5	Noodle Pot	3.5
"I'm only writing a review for this place because I think it deserves more than two starts. I like most people used a $6.99 coupon for an all American breakfast, 3 eggs, potatoes, toast, and your choice of meat. The meal itself was great and it came out in a timely manner. One thing that really stood out is when we were leaving, our server said ""have a blessed day"" I'm not religious or anything, but that's something I've never heard of and something I feel adds a very personal touch. 

For next time though, the suggestion I have is that you guys should probably have someone at the host stand seating people if there is a line of people waiting to be seated."	4	Rock & Rita's	2.5
Mmmmmmmmm, love me some local Vegas pizza! Their calzones are great and I love the meat sauce with bread. This all depends on personal preference but any pizza with light sauce is delish!	5	Metro Pizza	4
"WAHHHHHHHHH Thai food is good for the soul, get it away from me cause its making me fat!! 

I've been here for their lunch buffet and dinner now. Both were really really good and offered a lot of choices.

Lunch buffet rockstars: yellow curry, noodle soup, pad thai (duh), fried bananas. 
The things I wasn't feelin so hot about: the hot and sour soup and the spring rolls. 

Dinner choices included the drunken noodles, shrimp wrapped in a blanket, tom ka chicken soup, panang curry, and some interesting stuffed chicken (can't remember the name!) I really truly loved all of these dishes. 

I don't know if I would agree that this is the best Thai restaurant in America cause lets be honest, who can master all those dishes on the menu? BUT I will definitely be taking out of towners here!"	5	Lotus of Siam	4
"Ahhh I can't say how many stars I would give this place because I have such mixed feelings. They are really welcoming and the water here must be extra filtered because it tastes just like bottled! My first time here, we ordered the pad thai, tom ka chicken soup, and I think it was the duck curry. The pad thai was not the best I've ever had...but it was good. The tom ka, was SO flavorful, but also really spicy. The duck curry is what hit the spot (even though my mouth was on fire) I would totally recommend this place to anyone and I would definitely return. 

Now let me tell you about my return visit, We ordered the pad thai again as well as the curry, but were craving dessert. We ordered the mango sticky rice and I think they had mistaken the mango sticky rice for regular sticky rice. Since this order was to go, I assumed they had it right because most to-go orders are pretty simple. I didn't bother checking once I got it since I was in kind of a hurry. Unfortunately, I didn't trust my gut when I went in and told them what I ordered, because when I told them what I had gotten, the employees looked at each other and said ""uhh three items right."" For that reason I'm a little grumpy with this place which is why I am only giving them three stars."	3	Weera Thai Restaurant	4
"What a hidden gem! A lot of people may be scared away from the ""steakhouse"" title of Sushi Tower but the prices are super reasonable and the staff is extremely friendly. A little pushy when it comes to ordering specials or specific menu items, but really tasty items. 

Highlights of the menu: The Crazy Horse and the OMG Roll."	5	Sushi Tower & Steakhouse	4
"I wasn't a total fan of Carson Kitchen the first time I came here, but I've somehow returned numerous times and now consider myself a regular. I'm actually quite a fan now! 

Carson Kitchen has a really sweet and genuine staff with great knowledge of the menu (how its prepared, the ingredients that go into it, etc.) The food is strangely unique and everything is super tasty. I feel like the menu changes semi frequently, so I'll refrain from commenting on each individual dish.

My complaints:  
1. The setup - Come in the winter on a windy day and when the door opens, all your stuff gets blown over and you turn into a popcicle. Come in on a summer day and when the door opens, your stuff gets blown over and you melt into a pile of sweat.
2. Their prices - Carson Kitchen costs more than some places on the Strip! For me, that's what's holding them back from giving them five stars."	4	Carson Kitchen	4.5
"-1 star for not having a bell person open the door for pretty girls

I have nooooo idea where to start with this review because although I've never been to the loungey part of Hyde, I think I would prefer the lounge aspect over the nightclub. The view of the Fountains of Bellagio is just too pretty to have such a crowded area with old guys hitting on young gals (sorry to the older yelpers)

For those into EDM, this nightclub\/lounge, you'll probably want to hop on to the next place on your list."	4	Hyde Bellagio	3.5
"clean and friendly. what more can you ask for? oh yeah, the food is awesome! rosati's is almost like a women's sports bar...very sporty but not rowdy at all. 

there are little things that i really appreciated, one of those things being that the pan the pizza was being served on had spaces to ensure that the pizza did not get soggy. the unlv memorabilia was also a nice touch to those unlv alumni!"	4	Rosati's	3.5
"This review is for their to go service. I called in an order when I was feeling under the weather and not only was it done super quick, the pad thai lasted me three meals!

Ping Pong is conveniently located off of Sunset and close to the airport so its perfect for grabbing a late night snack on the way home."	4	Ping Pong Thai Restaurant	3.5
"How has it seriously taken me two years to visit this place? I came on fight night, George St. Pierre vs. Hendricks, it was PACKED. The place is nice but the service is really slow. I understand it taking a while to get a drink when the place is near capacity but after the fight was over and the place cleared out, the bartenders still seemed really overwhelmed and it still took a good 15-20 minutes to get a drink. 

I haven't had the food here but the prices here are super reasonable and definitely a locals spot!"	3	Miller's Ale House - Las Vegas	3.5
"Thinking about a place that serves brain and tongue literally makes me cringe. But thinking about their carne asada tacos just makes me want to eat. I had a carne asada and the al pastor. Both were great, but the carne asada kicked its ass. The tacos here are presented here really nicely! 

As great as the tacos are, there is always something to complain about. This place doesn't have chips and salsa!!! Major bummer. Also, this place is tricky. It's $6 for a taco!!!! The menu says $3.50 but when they ask you if you want everything on it and you say yes, its an extra $2.50 or so. I wish they would include it INTO the price of the taco so there are no surprises.

Like i said, these tacos are bomb, so its worth it."	5	Los Tacos	4
"The service: 5 stars. Very friendly owners who are super down to earth.
The food: eh! Honestly its just another typical pho place at a very reasonable price. I used their check in offer (two free eggrolls!) which were really good because it came with fish sauce, lettuce, and pickled carrots & daikon.

Another thing that I've noticed is that almost everything is relatively clean which is something that I look for in every restaurant since it can be hard to come by sometimes."	4	Pho Kinh Do	4
"I came here a while ago, so I can't remember exactly what I ordered but we came for happy hour. They had LOTS of choices for happy hour alone and the restaurant is very spacious. The service here is only eh but it's definitely a great place for happy hour. My sister and I came here and ordered 3-4 rolls and a seaweed salad, and it was only $25! For sushi! 

Whoever comes here, must must MUST get the Viva Las Vegas Roll. It's a little americanized but holy moly it is tasty!"	4	RA Sushi Bar Restaurant	3.5
"Well good thing I'm writing this review cause I am SO DAMN FULL that I can't sleep!! First of all, this place is REALLY LOUD. So be warned that if you are going there to converse with others...I wouldn't suggest coming here. Don't get me wrong, I love that the DJ had tons of enthusiasm but the volume of the music was just too loud. 

Our server was Jonathan, who seemed to be a really cool guy when he first introduced us. I personally felt really rushed to order our drinks. This is where the first problem arose...we wanted a plain vanilla milkshake and his snarky response was that ""all the shakes have vanilla"" so after we place our order for an oreo milkshake, we see on the menu that they have plain vanilla, chocolate, and other standard flavors. When we saw this we obviously confronted us and told him we just wanted the vanilla. He said that ""the order was already placed and as he was bringing us our other drinks he was literally blending it"" I'm not sure about you folks but when you are in the food and beverage industry, shouldn't you be attentive to the customers needs? Not sure if he was purposely trying to get a higher check average since the standard milkshakes were $3 less but anyways. I thought this was extremely rude of him to say that the milkshake was already being blended so we couldn't change our order when he wouldn't let us order what we wanted in the first place. The milkshake was yummy, but the principle.

When we asked about other menu alternatives he laughed and said ""you know this is a burger place right?"" Well excuse me...but if I remember correctly the right side of the menu had quesadillas, tacos, and a variety of other things. Who would have known it was such a crime to ask such a question.

Another thing that really tickled me was that during the meal, the fire alarm went off and NOBODY was evacuating. Yes, we probably should have taken it a little more seriously and at least gotten up to check what was going on but is it just me or is it illegal for them to not even make an effort to evacuate us while a fire alarm is going off?

We ordered the chicken wings to start and I had the Longhorn burger  for my main; and although it was extremely tasty, I didn't think it was anything to write home about (except the steak fries, yum) Ultimately, I would have to agree with my fellow Yelpers that the service here is extremely slow, with just average food. I think next time I'll have to make the drive to Bachi Burger.

The reason for my two star rating
-1 star for a snarky server
-1 star for not bringing us popcorn
-1 star because the food was just OK"	2	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4
I'm SO HAPPY I finally got to try Greens and Proteins after living here for 1.5 years!! This wasn't the best place to come for hangover food but I'm sad I waited so long to try this place out! Really unique menu items and good for a gal that's watching what she eats as everything has the calorie count and I think most menu items are only in the 300 calorie range. Things coming out were pretty fast but I have to come back again to try a green smoothie here! Check in on Yelp and I think you can get $1 off any smoothie.	4	Greens and Proteins	4
"Yum yum yum!! The place seemed super busy when I got here but we were still able to get a spot to sit immediately. The service was quick and friendly and the food was amazing. I had the Monte Cristo - which was different from what I was used to because it was deep-fried. My taste buds: lovin' it, my diet: not so much. 

The boy had an interesting egg-white scramble with tortilla strips and turkey which looked sloppy, but he liked it! Something really different about this breakfast joint is that you can pick between the standard toast or coffee cake - YUM!!

A super minute detail but I really enjoyed the essence of the fresh flowers. They had a bunch of items on the menu that I'm still dying to try so you can say its a place that is worth returning!"	5	The Cracked Egg	4
"Mixed feelings. The said most popular sandwich (Croque Madame) unfortunately did not live up to the hype. The pressed croissant is what made it worthy of ""best bakery in town""

I do give kudos to the establishment for having such a large kitchen, and for keeping the place so neat and tidy. Prices are a bit high, and they nickel and dime you for any kind of substitutions, which is what deters me from returning."	3	La Belle Terre Bread French Bakery Café	4
"I would have to agree with Kayla M. Stripburger is a pretty great people watching spot if you're able to get the right seat. 

I found that the food came out really fast, and really yummy. I also found that the prices were really reasonable considering their location. I dined here with 4 other girls and we got various things from the ahi tuna burger, to the special, to a salad, and a milkshake! Everything we had was super delicious and the portions here are really generous. 

The downside: I'm not sure if there is indoor seating but sitting outside & along the bar is perfect on a summer day in the shade!"	5	Stripburger	4
"Blahhhhh. I love the decor and location of the restaurant. Even as a local, who doesn't appreciate a good view of the dancing waters at the Bellagio? Unfortunately Circo,  I didn't like the service you provided. I completely understand that Las Vegas is a city full of booze but just because we didn't order endless bottles of wine that profits your restaurant and gives you higher gratuity doesn't mean that you can give us any less service - we are still paying customers. Since our table had six people it was auto gratuity, they really only performed at 10% gratuity level. 

Although the food was awesome and the portions were rather generous for a restaurant on the strip, people are ultimately paying for the service, not the food. Circo definitely wouldn't be my first choice if I had the opportunity to return"	3	Circo	4
"I would say that the food here is just ok...a lot of it seems like it is pre-made. Most people come here for the Hofbrau Hefe-Weitzen on tap which cannot be found many places in the United States. 

I really like the fact that they have a beer hall (very loud) and a beer garden (more quiet)"	3	Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas	3.5
"I love this place!! Located in a small shopping complex in Summerlin is the cutest not so little restaurant called Honeysalt! 

First off, the personal touches from the bath salts in the bathroom to the custom napkins, and the little items for sale in the front. LOVE.

For the food, I think it may be hit or miss. Clarice C and I shared the French toast and the fried chicken sandwich. Pretty sure the fried chicken sandwich was the best sandwich I've ever had! The side salad had really fresh ingredients and great flavor. I wasn't too crazy about the French toast and found it rather soggy. 

The employees were really friendly and focused on making sure that all the guests felt welcome and seemed very knowledgable about the menu.

Overall, Honeysalt has a lot of personality and I think the food has a lot of potential; it'll just require another visit!"	4	Honey Salt	4
"Writing a review on a hotel like the MGM Grand is so difficult cause there are so many components - the front desk, casino, rooms, etc. 

Parking: Beware the walk is forever from the garage to the lobby. Once you get to the lobby you are almost a little dumbfounded by the size of the lobby, hotel, and casino.

Rooms: If only the rooms were as ""grand"" as the hotel. (lol) Even though they just went through a ""grand renovation"" I still wasn't all that impressed, everything is still pretty standard and just not as dated.

There are so many hotels on Las Vegas Blvd I really have no idea if I would stay here again cause there are so many other places I'd like to try out!"	3	MGM Grand Hotel	3
"Amazing!!! It seems like all the menu items were very well thought out as all the items we ordered were executed and put together very well. 

Location is clean, organized, and the servers are very attentive.

Truffle fries are DIVINE. Can't wait to come back  so I can pig out again!"	5	Bachi Burger	4
"Ahhhhhh someone please take me back!!! And I apologize in advance because I know this review is going to be very long...but it is a HUGE buffet so don't blame me, blame Bacchanal :) 

If you are short on time just know..this buffet is WORTH VISITING. I was pretty skeptical by all the great reviews and the yelper's never lie..now for the people who would like to know what there is to have at this buffet: keep reading! 

Ok, I swear I'm not all over it because I'm asian but I can say i was genuinely impressed with the selection of asian food they had. The dim sum, multiple different soups varying from rice porridge, miso soup, hot and sour, won ton soup, ramen, and a curry type soup. Not only was the selection huge but the quality was great. I was really excited when I saw the korean bbq but it was a little tendon-y for my taste...
Highlights: seaweed salad, roast duck, rice porridge, and all the dim sum items.

Large assortment of deli meats that I didn't get to try because I was stuffing my face with other things. Same thing apples to the italian\/pizza station. I did try some of the meatballs and the tortellini. They were both tasty but neither ""wow-ed"" me. 

Next to the mexican station were probably 20-25 different types of salsa, yummmmyyyyy

Ok, the meat station...they probably need more than one guy working this station but I was one of the lucky gal's that tasted the brisket...man is that brisket the best brisket and meat and fat I have EVER tasted. Not that anyone has to convince me to go back to Bacchanal, but I would go back for the brisket period. I also had the ham but the ham was nothing compared to the brisket. On my next visit I hope to see chicken breast instead of whole chicken where you pick your pieces. I just try to avoid bones when possible...

The next station was carbo-junk food galore. Little baskets of sweet potato tater tots (please don't get me started), regular tator tots, fried chicken and french fries, don't remember the rest because I was too busy with the sweet potato tater tots. 

This is also really random...but the grilled asparagus was delicious. I am a fighter when someone serves me asparagus but I willingly got up for a second serving of asparagus here.

Unfortunately, the seafood station is another one that seems understaffed. I didn't try much of the seafood besides the crab because there were SO MANY PEOPLE! But, the crab was much too salty for my taste.

Before I end my praise of how great Bacchanal Buffet, PLEASE visit the crepe station and have one for me. In my visit, I ate 3, and its not because the crepes were small, unfortunately. I literally could not stop myself. There is an assortment of fresh blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and nutella, caramel, chocolate, freshly whipped whipped cream, etc. This crepe station alone is what sets Bacchanal aside from the others. 

However, there were a lot of things I was flat out not impressed with: 
1. The pathetic fruit selection. Not only was the selection pathetic but the presentation was not up to par with the other things in the buffet. Simple things like the pineapple...they didn't even remove the rind. My school dining hall serves the pineapple with rind. An upscale buffet where people are paying $45+tax and tip for dinner shouldn't have to do more work with the simple PINEAPPLE. Ok, enough with that. Onto the next thing
2. The Mexican station...I thought this station could use some improvement. First of all, the shredded beef or whatever meat they served definitely has way too many chunks of fat in it. That is all. The tamales, tasty but not enough meat. 
3. I understand that everyone is adapting to the ""small plates"" trend but I am not a fan..some of the items like the curly fries or other fried items I wanted to try ONE of but since they were pre-portioned, I couldn't! Sometimes the buffets end up wasting more through this method. Thats more of a suggestion than a complaint but whatever.
4. This place didn't have macaroons on my visit. But there are pictures on Yelp saying that they have macaroons. They either need to have macaroons everyday or not at all. (angry emoji)
5. Lastly, they need a bathroom inside the actual buffet. The bathroom is right outside where you pay but its inconvenient having to share a bathroom with everyone in the casino\/hotel along with the buffet customers.

Of course, no buffet is perfect so I'm afraid I have to give it a solid four stars. I hope to see continuous improvements on my next visit! (and hopefully not another price increase)

PS. I didn't think the servers were as slow as people made them out to be. Within 2 minutes we had our initial greet with our server to take our drinks. By the time I brought back my first plate, the drinks were there. Just an FYI!"	4	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"Dessert roti. NOMNOMNOM. I guess I better start off with what I did like. The salt and pepper chicken wings and the dessert roti's are total winners.

We tried the chicken curry with roti cause I read soooo many reviews about it but unfortunately, nothing about it wowed me! :( 
We also tried the salt and pepper shrimp and I won't say it was horrible...but I was not impressed. Leaving the head and shell on was quite a deal breaker for me.

The pro is that this place is more than affordable but unfortunately the lady\/probably owner isn't that friendly. Another thing I found really weird was that they would use real plates, but give you plastic utensils, which is a strange concept to me. This place is really only 3.5 stars worthy but thinking about the dessert roti makes it 4.

Here are the priceless reactions for the roti and chicken wings

"LOVE LOVE LOVE. This is as asian as I will get. I've only tried a couple things on the menu but this places makes me happy. I always, always get the salty rice roll. It tastes just like my mama's and takes me back home :) 

The chive pancakes, another yummy one! The only thing I don't like about it is how deep fried\/crunchy it is.

Service here is pretty quick, the people taking your order are only friendly on occasion.

To people who are not of the asian culture: they probably seem like they are really rude when you walk in....but thats just the way the are, lol."	5	Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli	3.5
"SkinnyFATS has a really great concept. We ordered multiple items during our visit and their flexibility with substitutions makes this establishment overly desirable. This place is a great place to visit if you're sharing so you can get a little bit of everything! They also sell items varying from breakfast to burgers so you can really come here during all hours of operation. 

The only downfall is its random location and size. It was really difficult to find since the sign is on the smaller side. Since it was also really busy, it was hard to find a a spot to sit. 

TIP: Order your dressing on the side when ordering a salad"	4	SkinnyFATS	4.5
"I think that this buffet has a good idea\/style, but the food doesn't live up to the name of the hotel. 

First of all, I think this hotel has a horrible system because of the fact that they have you pay in one area, and wait to get seated in another. Since you're paying first, you are tipping for service that you haven't received. That was my biggest thing.

A lot of people have brought up that this buffet provides a lot of choices, Asian, Italian, meat carving, salads, and a mac and cheese bar. They pre portion a lot of the food so theres less waste\/people don't over grab the food they are providing. I think it has a really cute idea, but some of the portions are still too big. The quality of the food I would say was just average; I left this place with nothing to rave about.

The desert is a whole different story. Almost everything is edible! Cups of chocolate inside chocolate mousse with fresh fruit on top. They had a variety of bread pudding, gelato, and different types of pudding and baked goods.The best thing I had was the chocolate covered strawberries ( plain chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate covered strawberries with crushed oreos, and chocolate covered strawberries with toffee)

For the price ($35 for dinner) I was expecting a little more variety (sushi and salads), but it was definitely worth trying."	3	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"The food quality itself is only worth 3-3.5 stars, but since the menu is always changing, I have to give it 4. 

There are TONS of choices when you come here, especially if you come on a regular basis. Pizzas are changing daily, international station, comfort food, salad bar, bottomless french fries, etc.

I've had so many different meals here that I can't really comment or I would be here forever! Just know that when you come here you will always have TONS of options.

People might be curious about the prices: 
Breakfast: $6:50
Lunch: $7:75
Dinner: $8.45

My biggest complaint: the bathrooms here are NOT up to par with the other ones at UNLV."	4	Hazel M Wilson Dining Commons	3
"So happy I bought my LivingSocial deal here! Lots of positives and negatives though.

This Pita Pit is extremely clean and has a lot of options. Though it's not ""expensive"" I found that the pita's here didn't fill me up. 

I was not a fan of the the person at the register, who was making the pitas while simultaneously taking orders, not sanitary. 

I found that this Pita Pit doesn't have a great system because people are crowding around at the fillings waiting\/trying to tell the employee what they want in their pita in a very small area. The ""restaurant"" needs to be more spread out and not have everything clumped together."	4	Pita Pit	4
YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM. i am a LOVER of Secret Pizza. I've only tried the white and the cheese but do I wanna come back or what! I had California Pizza Kitchen today and Secret Pizza is on a totally different scale of deliciousness. What makes it so different is that its nice and crispy on the bottom when they are reheating it. I can't wait to come back!	5	Secret Pizza	4
"Came here the other night and MAN! Is this place worth yelping over or what. First of all, great ambiance, great location. 

The menu had lots of choices and was very busy. We were on our way to the airport and told out waiter that we were kind of in a rush. He punched in our food and it came out I would say within ten minutes. I was extremely impressed.

Not only did the food come out timely and our server was very attentive, but the food was DELICIOUS! I had the Tuscan Harvest Salad and it was so delicious. It had chicken, bacon, dried cranberries, fresh apples, and a nice vinaigrette to top it along with other things that I can't remember.

For the price, this restaurant exceeded my expectations and I will DEFINITELY be coming back!"	5	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
Yuck - I was at the grocery store when I decided I would order Dominos for dinner. Since I ordered it there I decided to wait for it and what a mistake! The employees were running around like chicken with their heads cut off and more importantly - they were not washing their hands! Employees were using hand sanitizer in place of washing their hands after handling money or phone orders. This to me is a big no no and the health department needs to pay this place a visit so they are reminded the rules of food safety!	2	Domino's Pizza	2.5
"I expected better, Searsucker!!

We came for dinner on a Sunday and ordered 3 appetizers, and 3 entrees over four people. The service was good, and our server seemed to know a lot about the menu and recommended some dishes that we ended up ordering.

Here's my report:
crab cake jumbo lump + fennel + aioli - delicious 
short rib ""the harlot"" + horseradish + fried onion - probably the highlight of the meal
artichoke hearts + cheddar + mozzarella - this was a dip with poor execution - this is why. They gave us a very large portion of this cheesy dip with three pieces of bread. When we asked for more bread (more than half the dip left with no toast) we were told that they would have to charge us for it.
pork butt - standard, nothing special
butcher steak - did not try this, however the presentation was nice.

Sorry, but when you're spending $200+ on a meal I'd expect to receive a sufficient amount of bread to go with my dip. 

Return Factor: None."	2	Searsucker	4
"I'm baaaaack. We gave YardHouse another try and our experience was definitely better - but the Santana Row location will always be home. 

We decided to come for lunch and since the weather was beautiful we decided to sit outside. I have NO IDEA why YardHouse does this but they sit people when their servers are at lunch. The logic makes NO SENSE to me because how is there supposed to be service at a table when the server assigned to it is off the clock. Right? I'm not sure either. This happened last time and it happened again. Thankfully the server wasn't on lunch for a godly amount of time and we were actually able to get our order in in a timely manner.

The food seems really consistent location to location and you can't get me away from their french fries or  BBQ Ranch chicken salad but seating your customers in an area that won't get any service needs to change. Until then, this place is still just ""ok"	3	Yard House	4
"SO happy my mom asked me to give this Fleming's location another chance. Over the past year, they have really made some drastic improvements: the first being the smiling hostesses.

My experience was much better than the last time but that could be because we were in the dining room this time. The dining room provided nothing less than a five star experience. 

The food was flawless and my taste buds were beyond satisfied. Fleming's, will you please share the secret to your ice cream?

Taylor R was our server and although she was a sweetheart and did a wonderful job, our experience was really based on our busser, Gil. He was AWESOME. Never was my water glass less than half full and he was always willing to grab something if we needed it. He works with passion and is truly looking out for the customers best interest. Servers would be nowhere without their bussers and I really think that Gil's service should be recognized. 

Can't wait for my next visit to Fleming's - hopefully the Town Square location that should be opening soon!"	5	Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar	4
"Had the breakfast buffet here, and I don't think we'll be doing that again.

The food was mediocre. The service was actually pretty good. The setup of the dining area and buffet was atrocious. A long line outside to be seated, then a line almost as long to actually get food. The selection was pretty limited, as its basically a motel style continental breakfast. There is no live cooking, the ""omelets"" are just a warmer tray of dried out eggs covered with cheese. The whole buffet area is basically one small counter of warmer trays stuck in the back of the dining area.

With the rather long line to get any food, most people were double fisting with two plates. This, in turn, meant that the supply of clean plates was quickly exhausted, stopping the line from any further movement.

Finally, you don't pay when you enter. When you leave, you pay at a cashier counter, so there is often yet another line to wait.

All in all, really not worth the amount of waiting involved."	2	Sidewalk Cafe	2.5
overpriced, small portions. There's far better food for the same price range.	1	La Salsa	3
"Tricky to find, but well worth it. A good slice of New York style pizza, thin crust and greasy as all hell.

It's in the east tower, third floor, near a pool table. Look for people coming out if a little hallway with pizza in their hands."	5	Secret Pizza	4
Placed a to go order for tri tip and spicy smoked sausage. They said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I showed up after 20 minutes and the hostess acted as if she had no idea how to ring me up or ring up what I ordered. That part wasn't the problem but training your staff properly is always a good idea. My food was cold and the portions was extremely small for the $32 that I was charged. I live 2 minutes away from Red Rock casino and will drive to Famous Dave's next time.	2	Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que	3.5
Placed an online to go order. Ordered a half sandwich and a house salad and a grilled BBQ pasta with a house salad. The total was $24. Yes, $24 for two lunch specials. Specials are typically discounted hence the "special" label. They obviously don't get that part or that's why they don't advertise the prices online. Went to pick up my order and found all of the to go order parking spots taken with no one in their cars and no one inside waiting for their orders.  The food was good but not great.  I suggest skipping their online ordering set up all together. It's not worth it	2	BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse	4
Who ever drives the F150 shouldn't be driving. Plus you look like a douchebag when you double park in a handicap spot. Stop being a douche	1	Geo's tacos	5
Great food, great service and great atmosphere. The fajitas were awesome and you can't beat their margarita's . Would highly recommend and we will be back soon. Best hidden Mexican food off of the strip	5	Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina	4.5
The food is good but not great. They like to skimp on the meat in  their sandwiches. It's as if it comes out of their paychecks if they portion it compared to the high price. As I walked in today there was a line of around 6-7 people and only 1 registrar open. Some one said something then they opened 2 more. I ordered a ham and swiss half sandwich with a cop of chick noodle soup.  I asked for no onion or tomato. They gave me nothing on the sandwich. Bread, meat and cheese is all I got. The part that really pissed me off was waiting almost 20 minutes for my food as the lady behind me who ordered about 6 sandwiches and a few other items got her food first. Why would you make the person who ordered first with 2 items total wait longer than a large order? Crap service with over priced food. Better portions would help	2	Panera Bread	3
Omg, the food here! Talk about delicious, ginormous dishes. My group tried the cinnamon apple pancakes and the chicken and waffles. The portions were huge, definitely come hungry! It was busy but the staff was super great and the atmosphere was great too. A must try for sure!	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
This place is terrible. The food is awful. I ordered the steak fajitas and it was not good. Service was bad, my sister who is vegan ordered the veggie fajitas, they gave her steak.  I ordered pico de gayo to go with the chips and salsa and it never came.  My husband got some steak thing and it was smothered with nacho cheese (I'm pretty sure from the can).  One thing positive was the place was packed with rowdy kids and families so it was kid friendly.	1	Macayo's Mexican Restaurant	3
A must stop when I'm in Las Vegas for Cajun.  I have eaten her numerous times and never a let down.  I keep going back.  Great food and exceptional staff.	5	Cravin' Cajun	3.5
"Las Vegas, man. Every now and then, a guy has to go hang out in one of these mafia money warehouses and roll the bones a few times. Vegas has changed a bit over the decades. Where it used to be that a guy went there for unspeakable indulgences, now he might take a family. Whatever. The deal is that, today, Las Vegas doesn't just jack your billfold at the ol' one-armed bandit, they take a chunk outta your backside with everything, everywhere. 

But, I ain't here to disrespect ol' Sin City. I'm just here to throw out a hint for some of the folk who want to get a little more bang for the buck. Listen. We all know The Lord threw the yoke on us and tasked us to plow the dirt outside the garden gates, right? When we earn a dollar, it takes a lot more than a dollar's effort. That's why you gotta be smart when you got a handful of lettuce. 

I know what your thinkin'... If a guy has money issues, why ever visit Vegas? Well, sometimes a guy is asked to do some work that puts him in expensive places. What can I tell you? Simmer down and keep reading.

This is where the Yard House, just off the Strip, can help your wallet out. Yard House is one of those chain restaurants. It's owned by the same dudes that own Olive Garden. But, hey! This ain't no Olive Garden. I won't even review an Olive Garden. 

Yard House Vegas is a pretty nice joint. It is a nice, big dining room with air conditioning, full bar, and decent food. One big detail about Yard House is that they typically have very good service. In fact, I have never had anything other than excellent attention at YH. Yard House Vegas has standard menu pricing, so it is about the same here as it is in any other town. That's a welcome relief from the casino concourse restaurants that hand you a wallet whoopin' like 30 minutes at the Texas Hold 'Em. 

Just look for the High Roller, the giant Ferris wheel on the strip. The Yard House is in the shadow.  

And, listen. I just saved you one Andrew Jackson, here. Be cool with the wait staff. Imagine the freak show they gotta deal with every day. I can assure you they ain't livin' the dream out there in the desert. Make it worth their while. Slide your spinach over to the sure bet, and help another human being out. Maybe your dollar will let 'em win big and get that ticket out of Sin City and into God's Country. Be a saint!

Not a place to go.  12 in our party.  45 min till our last person was served!  Had to send salad back.  Bugs in it!  I had corn beef sandwich.  Was sooo dry, it was almost inedible.  We were on a lunch break from a meeting.  Lunch took 1 1\/2 hr!	1	Hash House A Go Go	3.5
Food was excellent.  Large window opening into kitchen from dining room.  Looked like you could eat off the floor it was so clean.  Staff was very friendly and welcoming.  Service from the kitchen was VERY slow.  This was the only reason I did not give it 5 stars!	4	Prosecco Fresh Italian Kitchen	4.5
Fantastic steak house.  Had crab& avocado salad.  Real blue crab meat.  Excellent taste and flavor.  Main course " Beef Wellington ".  This was definitely  5 stars!  Cooked to perfection.  First time here.  Tried it out with a TravelZoo coupon.  Will return with or without coupon!	5	Edge Steakhouse	4.5
"If you're ever in Vegas, this is one of the best Streak places I've been to (and I've been to a lot in Vegas).  As expected, the service here is on point so I'll talk about the food:

-Apps here are amazing.  Bread here is amazing.  I will warn you, though, don't get suckered into eating so much bread or apps becasue you won't have much room for the actual dinner.

-We tried family style steaks, getting a little but of each steak craved up for us.  NY was good..Filet was juicy...ribeye was flavorful...but it is all in the flank. Yes, I said flank!  Ask the server put the flank next to you.  When you're done eating as much as you can, that's when you can offer the rest to the entire group.  Just think about it:  While all the amateurs are going for the filet, you'll be in steak heaven with the flank.  And yes...you can thank me later!

I can't wait to go back on my next visit in Vegas!"	5	Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak	4
"I give this place a certified 5 starts.

Everything in this place was excellent, from the friendly staff.
The selection is rich, and right on the spot. 

I got Tomato and Mozza with a Spring Salad, and finish it with the Chick Parmigiana. 
My Lady got the Diavolo with the Chard star.

The Vine list was good as well.

My experience was a 5 starts. Had the amazing view to the canal which was a big plus.

The Venetian is our Main prefer hotel. and this place gets our 2nd Favorite spot in Las Vegas."	5	Zeffirino	3.5
This place still one of the top 10 restaurants. I wish the one in L.A was still open. But you can only find the nearest one in Las Vegas. So if your staying at the Palazzo or V. you have to dine here. They still make one of the best Chiken Parmesan	5	Grand Lux Cafe	4
AWESOME place! Found it through this site and got the recommended dishes of Pan Tai, fried rice and then yellow curry!!! Yum! Dishes are spicy so review helped me keep it at 2 which was perfect. Our second visit tried Beef PHO which was fabulous! Best I have had! Rounded off with doughnuts for dessert! Great service and great food! A place to not miss!!!!	5	Pan Asian	4.5

"Came to Monta based upon word of mouth recommendations and was pleasantly relieved we made the right choice in coming to eat there. I had the Miso Ramen and the broth was a delivery of full body. It wasn't bland or too saltly or just average and so I was a happy camper. I had added the eggs and corn to my order. It was like a partyin my mouth. The pork was cooked perfectly and the portions were ideal.
I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas and a Ramen fix!"	5	Monta Ramen	4
"My girlfriend had been dying to try Firefly for quite some time and kindly decided to take me for a belated birthday dinner. We were able to make reservations through open table via the yelp app (very cool and super easy)! Based upon reviews of Helpers and friends Firefly was surely a place that would please our curious appetites.
The service we received was attentive and extremely helpful. Our server had us stop ordering after we selected 6 items suggesting that it may be too much food for 2 people. I had a craving for a cocktail and order the Cherry Mule. It was such a creative take on the Moscow Mule with the twist of adding the St. Germaine's lovely flavor. Thebread and butter was absolutely a great pairing. The butter was sweet and the bread was slightly salty. Our server recommended the figs which we loved! They were stuffed with candied walnuts and sprinkled with cheese as well as a great lightly drizzled sauce. Next were the tuna tartar & ceviche. The tuna tartar was accompanied by fried taro chips and not only did it look good it was also very filling. If I had to pick a favorite of the Tuna Tartar and the Ceviche, then it'd be the ceviche hands down. It was so flavorful and refreshing! The next item was the spicy beef salad and item did not disappoint with its slight kick and yummy dressing! We decided to try out the Diablo shrimp and octopus. Of the 2 dishes I'd recommend the shrimp over the octopus since octopus seemed to have too much going on. We decided to add another dish for good measure. I must confess that Chicken AND Chorizo was my absolute favorite dish!!!! What an amaze combo of tastiness! 
To end our meal we ordered the gelato trio and chocolate trees leches cake. The chocolate tres leches cake was ok. I've had better versions in Santa Ana and at other establishments, but the Gelato Trio was spot on!"	4	Firefly	4.5
"My friends were kind enough to walk down to grab some dinner for us while they got their gambling on. I had requested the kids rolled tacos chicken meal that came with chips, salsa and a drink. It was really all that I needed to get me through the night. The salas, light drizzle of sour cream and cilantro was perfect. I'd recommend the kids meals to those who want something small but not too small of a meal. 
Thanks Chronic Tacos for helping me not faint from hunger!"	4	Chronic Tacos	3
"Very good food.  Very good selections .  Very nicely displayed.  But,. pricey !!!!
$35.  is a lot of money.  It includes Beer & Wine.  Big deal.  I was super tired,. super hungry, so I went.  I did really enjoy everything I had.  I guess things have just gotten more expensive."	5	Cravings Buffet	3
"Amazing. We did not make a reservation, and we're lucky to get a table at 7pm, on Thurs. it was full by the time we left. what a setting, 24th floor . This IS old Vegas. The decor, is early '70's and all the waiters are older men. I had the onion soup, my partner had the course salad, and we shared a huge hunk of prime rib. The quality, taste, flavors, and presentation was outstanding.
we had a bottle of wine and our bill was $100.
really glad we went for it. with so many places, it's really difficult to choose.  I would put this choice under the' unique ' experience ."	5	Top of Binion's Steakhouse	4

I had the cheeseburger the first time, and the chicken club the second visit.  
will go back here again for sure."	5	Denny's	3.5
"After reading the reviews of Yelp, I decided to try this place. Not bad, just some things I wanted to point out. 

1) the menus posted outside the restaurant is old, Gangnam package shows calamari, they now replaced the sit down menus with corn (I've posted the new menu)

2) I got my miso soup and salad BEFORE my drinks. When I asked the waiter, he said he didn't work my table. 

3) the waiter who said he didn't work my table, was quick to take my money and ring me up after I was done eating."	4	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5
First time coming here, it's wayyy better than Chuck E Cheese. Brought my son here while visiting Vegas @night. Minus one star, they are always out of food. Salad is not that fresh. They need more fruits for the kids.	4	John's Incredible Pizza Company	3
So good. Their coffee has cinnamon in it and it's the best. I had 3 full cups. The tortilla soup was scrumptious and the census from the family was that the menudo was very satisfying. The tamales oh my gosh they were so delicious. Very moist. I would definitely hit this spot again .	5	Doña Maria Tamales Restaurant	3.5
This place is as authentically a 'dive bar' as the Disney castle is authentically a castle. That said, I somehow don't hate it. Stepping out of the Venetian's marble extravagance into dark and carefully arranged grunge was kind of hilarious. Decent service, passable food, beer was cold. Gave it an extra star for the awesome retro rock music blaring over the speakers.	3	The Rockhouse	3
This place makes ah-mazing burgers and fries. It has a great beer selection. I hear the shakes are out of this world (I'm not much of a sweets person). But here's the thing. If I'm scarfing down a burger and fries in Vegas it's generally way past midnight and I'm hoping to stave off at least a little of my incipient hangover - and I'll end up doing it with something cheaper than Holsteins. But if you're into gourmet burgers, you can't go wrong here!	4	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4
"THE BEST CARNE ASADA I HAVE EVER EATEN!

I ate in stunned silence soaking in the mix of favors, aromas, sights and sounds.  This is yet another example of the inescapable rule - if you see all of God's children flocking into a restaurant indifferent of race or socioeconomic class - go in, take it in and EAT WITH THEM - the world would be a better place!  This place is incredible... The taco standard hence forth!

The only thing that would make this more authentic would be to move all to Cabo and put in on wagon behind a truck!  

Ok... So down to the glorious details...

When you first walk in you see that you can order various item at different stations from around counter, but if you're a newbie have no fear, just ask someone and they'll be super happy to yell to the right part of the kitchen with what you want.  After your attention is averted from the large menu (not that there's a lot on it... It's just huge!), you notice 2 massive rotisseries with layer upon layer seasoned pork, Al Pastor topped with a signature pineapple.  Much like Gyros or Shawarma, Al Pastor, the Mexican version of the same is serious indicator of being in place that cherishes flavor and authenticity.  Unlike the other two meats, how Al Pastor is seasoned varies widely based on he tradition and locality of those making it... Which always makes it somewhat of an anticipated reveal!  This al pastor was highlighted with a very mild version of its common seasoning namely Guajillo, ancho, cumin, garlic onion, and pineapple allowing the charred meat shine through a bit more on its own.  Seared in the traditional manner with cilantro and onions on soft FRESHLY MADE corn tortilla only made it that much better!  The carne asada tacos were even better which was honestly hard to believe even possible!  The lightly seasoned and thinly sliced steaks are flash grilled over a fire that defies the term HOT to be then placed in a warming container next to the girl where magic clearly happens here.  The steaks, being close to the grill, continue to slow cook and steep in the smoky sooty goodness from the grill making hands down THE BEST CARNE ASADA I HAVE EVER EATEN!

Check out my pics ...  The tacos are generous and juicy.  Tortillas are all freshly made.  

No matter what you do in Vegas, this will be one of the highlights... If I'm wrong call me out... If I'm right, just smile and pass it forward !"	5	Tacos El Gordo	4
"Defied every expectation... incredible, bar was very very pricey. 4 stars only because I think the prices per portion are out of line high...especially the bar!

Everything was on point... Everything conscientiously thought out and purposeful.  Lighting and ambience...one off the best uses if space, light and textures I've ever seen.  You lose yourself in the ambiance so even if it's busy, it feels intimate.  

Food... well the food was top tier in terms of preparation and technique. Flavors were bright and complex, cooked to PERFECTION!  We had a variety if plates, but the stand outside were the squid, pork chop, and the bronzino.  I assume the pork was done sous-vide and then flash grilled.  Prefect medium rare and yet warm through out.... succulent to the bone literally!

Looking forward to going next time....I well acid the bar though... $16 cocktails is silly for the pour and location."	4	Honey Salt	4
"Feeling hungry, my family and I decided to get Popeyes. The lady on the drive thru speaker was acting like she didn't care what we wanted to order. We had to repeat what we wanted to order 3 times. .__. 

It took 15 minutes to get our food. 

When we got home we saw that our order was wrong. Instead of mashed potatoes, we got fries. 

The food is great, but I wish the service is better."	3	Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen	2
When I'm in Vegas, I usually eat what is close by and it's usually a buffet.  There are times when you want to eat something else and this place is it.  Food is awesome, they always refill when it runs out and if you stay long enough, they may put something new in the buffet lineup.  Did I mention this place is C H E A P!  On the strip, you will pay $25 to $30 min right?  I barely spent $10 here.  If you like the best Filipino Buffet in town, go here and don't forget to Yelp it!  Also, get ready for a packed place, it is very small here.	5	Nanay Gloria	3.5
"My friend and I were here on a Saturday night. We made reservation at 7 in advance, when we arrived, the restaurant was pretty slow, about 4 tables including us. Honestly, I was expecting a traditional Japanese look of the restaurant, but the restaurant's interior was not, it was more like a American restaurant look. 
        Anyhow, we ordered a bunch of sushi, and a specialty sashimi plate server recommended, and a wagyu beef plate. The fish quality was really good! But the sauce they put on some of the sushi I didn't enjoy that much. Especially the sauce they put on Uni and Snapper. Other than the sauce, they all tasted pretty good, because the fish quality was Fresh! 
 The wagyu beef was the best! It was really fresh! And the salmon specialty sashimi plate was good, too!( it was one of the popular dish) 
        Service was okay.. we ordered like 8 different sushi? But every sushi plate came separately, and it took about 5-15 minutes for every another plate to come :\/ and because we were hungry, we later added the wagyu beef plate, and it took about 20 mins!! It really took forever.. seriously.   there was only 2 tables including us .. 3 sushi chefs and 2 servers?! Servers were nice, but it was a little bit difficult to get their attention when we needed. And last, I hate to say this, but I saw one of the server's nail seemed really dirty, it was black .. I don't think it is appropriate for servers, because it made me lost a bit of appetite at first.) 
          Overall, If the food can come out faster it would be a lot better!"	3	Yonaka Modern Japanese	4.5
"The day I went I was craving for some oysters, so I found this place has great reviews on Yelp. This place only has about 16 ?bar seatings, is located in the Palace hotel. Me and my friend went together, got there around 5, and waited about almost 2 hours. Finally, we got seated. We had oysters, seafood spicy soup, etc. all of those were really good. And when we about to leave, the wait line got even longer! Overall, very satisfied. 
Be ready to wait before you come:)"	5	Oyster Bar	4.5
"Nothing special about this place, and the service is terrible. We had the pancakes and an omelette, and the food was nothing above average, and quite expensive. 

We waited forever for a refill on water and coffee, and finally had to ask another server. It was a Sunday morning, and they had QVC playing on the tvs. Wtf? 

I wouldn't waste my money here, and would instead go somewhere better for the money."	3	Oyster Bay Seafood	3
This place is amazing. The price is great, food is awesome, and service is super fast. I randomly found this place last year, and as a visitor to Vegas, I hate paying strip prices for quality sushi. But all you can eat for $24?! Yes, please! Normally all you can eat sushi is crappy rolls, but this is premium stuff here, so it's well worth the money. Definitely a must eat if you're looking for great sushi but don't want to pay $200 for two people.	5	Yama Sushi	4
"The food was excellent, and the service was good with regard to her attentiveness. However, because we sat at the bar due to the line, I heard her moan and complain about every single thing. I know I'm in Vegas, but every other word shouldn't be a curse word or bashing of the managers and how they ""chewed"" her ""ass"" for not getting something signed, and she didn't ""give a s*it""--about ten million times. I thought it was rude and inconsiderate to speak like that in front of customers. 

The chipotle ketchup was amazing, and the burger was delicious."	4	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
Oh where to start...we ordered lots of diffrent plates and they were all amazing! Also we had the seafood plater and the display was carved out of ice!! Really high quality, please check it out if your in town!	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
Food was delicious! Our waitress was right on with all her suggestions.  Good music, ambience, and food.  Also, the manager came out and gave us a special happy anniversary treat! It was such a nice surprise! Sushisamba made our anniversary dinner a special one.	5	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
Nice casual atmosphere, we stopped there on the way to the airport from the Vegas strip for lunch and it wasn't crowded at that time. Good for families or large parties. It has a great variety of game changing burgers on the menu. Such creativity and really good tasting. They also have ramen and other yummy dishes. The oxtail chili fries with fried egg on top was to die for. I had the Miyaki-san burger, sooo good, I highly recommend it. Please open one in Seattle!!	5	Bachi Burger	4
This place is new to my block all the staff is welcoming and helpful, I love the location. A bit expensive but overall good poke!	4	Tail and Fin	4
Service and staff where excellent.  Salad and breads great.  But not the best seafood we have had.  Tuna was over cooked and had no flavor.  Scallops were average.  We were expecting way better with the reviews we saw.  Way over priced for the quality of seafood we received.  Definitely not on my list of places to visit again.	2	Hugo's Cellar	4.5
Great food and staff.  And great prices.  A definite stop if you ever get to Vegas.	4	Lotus of Siam	4
We had an incredible meal here for our anniversary thanks to all the positive Yelp reviews. My husband and I are big Mexican food lovers and had very high expectations, which were more than met. The margaritas were fresh, the tableside guacamole was to die for (go for spicy--you won't regret it), and my skirt steak fajitas were divine. My husband had the pork carnitas and agreed that my dish was better, but his was still very good. Try not to fill up on chips before the meal--easier said than done, but you'll want to leave room for dessert. We had the banana ice cream with churros and caramel sauce (I forget the name of the dish). Service was attentive but I don't remember any particular details--I was too focused on the food and my nice margarita buzz. We will come back here on our next trip for sure.	5	Diego Mexican Cuisine	3.5
"This is my new favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas. We liked it so much we ate there twice on our last visit, once on a Saturday and again on Monday. We got there before 11 both days and were seated within 10-15 minutes. Service was prompt both days. 

On Saturday, the server warned us that the food may be slow, but it wasn't.  We started with the shrimp cocktail, which was to die for. I agree with others who say this is a surprisingly good dish for breakfast, though perhaps a little heavy on the cocktail sauce. I had the pancakes and cinnamon roll, both very tasty. I ordered the short stack (2) and couldn't finish it, so consider splitting an order if you don't have a huge appetite. The eggs\/hashbrown\/meat option is standard fare but the toast and jam are both standouts. 

Our friend who joined us on Monday raved about the chocolate milk, which is made with Hershey's Syrup and is apparently superior to anything pre-made, according to our picky friend. 

The only downside to the restaurant is its distance from the Strip--it costs about $30 to take a cab here one-way, so plan to spend the day downtown to get your money's worth (or take the bus). The restaurant is within walking distance of the Mob Museum, the Neon Museum, and the Natural History Museum. Fuel up at Du-Par's before you go!"	5	Du-Par's	4
"We had a solid meal here. Booked through OpenTable and were seated promptly. Our waiter was excellent--it was clear he loved the restaurant and the food and offered excellent suggestions. We had one of the mozzarella dishes as an appetizer. It was good but not great. My husband had the duck pasta and I had the prosciutto pizza. Although the dough was cooked well, my pizza was kind of bland...I couldn't finish it. My husband's pasta was excellent but very rich. We had the caramel pudding dish for dessert and it was heavenly. 

Overall our experience was very positive, but I didn't love the food enough to want to come back on future visits to Vegas."	4	D.O.C.G. Enoteca	3.5
I love Northside Nathans. The pizza is great and the chicken wings are crispy and awesome. The garlic ranch is good on both. I wouldnt consider it to be authentic Italian pizza by any means, but it is still really good. They have cheap lunch specials and good prices in general. The employees are always nice and helpful. They have old school arcade games which is pretty fun while you are waiting for your food. It is very family friendly.	5	Northside Nathan's Pizza	3.5
This place is great. The specialty items are really creative and tasty. I love the carrot cake pancakes. They taste like a mild carrot cake and they come with cream cheese syrup. The french toast and crepes are also good. The regular breakfast items, like omelets and eggs, are like an average breakfast place. My only complaint about Babycakes is the wait. I have pulled into the parking lot and left as many times as I have been in to eat. They are almost always busy, which is a great thing for them and a good sign of the food. Just go with having a 15-20 minute wait in mind. It is well worth it.	4	BabyStacks Cafe	4
I first ate at RM a couple of years ago and I was totally impressed with the food. I ate in the upstairs area and couldn't have been happier. The oysters were some of the best that I have ever had. I am partial to the restaurant because of Rick Moonen's beliefs on sustainability and I am more than happy to put my money into his business. My only complaint is that I wish I could afford to eat there more.	5	RM Seafood	3.5
I absolutely love the Border Grill. I have been eating there for years and have had no bad experiences. The food is great and if you're a local you can sign up for their locals club and get a discount every time you go in. The plantain empanadas are my favorite menu item and the desserts are great. I have tried nearly every menu item and love it all.	5	Border Grill	4
I have only been to Opa about four times, but it has always been good. I have eaten at several Greek\/Mediterranean places and this is one of the best. It's a great family place.	4	Opa Restaurant	3.5
Cafe Rio isn't bad. They have great prices and a punch card system where you get a free meal after 10 visits. The only problem is all of the employees make the food differently. Sometimes you'll get too much cheese while other times there's not enough. I would think that it would be a great place for groups or families. They also have different daily specials that are priced well.	3	Cafe Rio	3.5
Viva Mercados is great. I love the vegetarian fajitas. They're made with onions, peppers, zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, and nopales. Definitely the best. One of the few mexican places in town that offers a vegetarian menu.	4	Viva Mercado's	4
I usually have a problem with neighborhood Chinese places. The food can be over sauced and greasy and sometimes poor quality. But China One is none of that. I love the fried tofu and veggie lunch special. It is less than $6 and comes with chow mein and fried rice. The veggies are fresh and clean and the tofu is good. The portion is huge. A lunch special is big enough to share with another person. The shrimp dishes are great. The shrimp doesn't have a fishy taste at all. The service is fast and the staff is friendly. My only complaint is that they serve everything on Styrofoam and then throw it away.	4	China One	3
Definitely not bad. I like the sandwiches quite a bit. They have a good selection of deli salads. They also sell their deli meats and cheeses by the pound. The marinara sauce is really good so I would recommend any sandwich that has marinara on it. The owners are very friendly and very appreciative for anyone's business. Eat here to support local business!	3	Eddie D's	4
Rosemary's is a great little restaurant. I have been there many times and it's always good. It is more of a fine dining place without the expense. I had a fantastic butternut squash soup with pepitas. My husband loved the sweetbreads (the brain kind, not the bread kind). The menu has something for everyone, whether they're picky or adventurous. I have never a had a bad meal here. And by eating there you support local business which is always a good thing.	4	Rosemary's Restaurant	4.5
The Capital Grille is so good. They have a drink called the Stoli Doli where they take fresh pineapple and soak it in vodka for several days and then drain out the vodka and serve it cold. It is the best drink I have ever had. They have a great variety of steaks and an even better seafood menu. Its a good place to go on a date.	5	The Capital Grille	4.5
I had beef tacos, chicken tacos, and the asian fries. Everything was delicious. The fries, while DELICIOUS, were a little out of place since I dont usually eat fries with my tacos. Other people might really like them together.  I waited for my food and then just ate in my car. I would definitely recommend this place and I will be back soon. The owner was incredibly nice.	5	Hanshiktaco	3.5
Oh my. So good. They have a big menu with all kinds of great things. I would have to say that they have one of the best biscuit and gravy breakfasts around. The portions are huge so there's always leftovers. It's also a great place to nurse a hangover.	4	Black Bear Diner	4
I was thoroughly disappointed with this place. The restaurant wreaked of raw, bloody beef. The whole place was filthy with food all over the floors and the tables were dirty. I got a grilled cheese with the veggie frites and everything was so oil saturated that I couldn't even eat it. My husband got a burger and he said it would have been better had it not been dripping excessive oil the whole time. It's definitely not vegetarian friendly, which is fine considering that it is a hamburger place. But I won't return.	1	Smashburger	3.5
Mack Bros. has a great breakfast menu with some unique and delicious options. The hash browns are fantastic and the portions are pretty generous. My only complaint would be the service. On numerous occasions I have had to wait about 40 minutes for my food to come out, which is pretty absurd for breakfast food. However, it was their first month open so I think they were still working out all of the kinks. I would recommend them to try, but just be prepared to wait. Hopefully this has changed since they have been open for a couple of months now.	3	Mack Bros Bakery Cafe	2.5
I must say that I really like Lou's Diner. They have delicious breakfast food and a great lunch menu. They also sell homemade jam by the jar. Lou's is also well priced. Two people can eat a wonderful breakfast and walk out of there for less than twenty bucks. They've been around for a long time and they've proven why. Love It!	4	Lou's Diner	4.5
I was a little apprehensive about trying Fleur de Lys since the place looks a little pretentious from the outside. My husband and I tried it one night and I am so glad that we did. I don't typically like cooked salmon, only raw. But they had the best salmon dish that I have ever had. It had no fish taste whatsoever. The food is creative and the quality is obviously important to them.	5	Fleur by Hubert Keller	4
The Samosa Factory is my favorite Indian place in Las Vegas. They have a large vegetarian and vegan menu as well as some great lamb and chicken dishes. I recommend the masala fries and tandoori chicken. And the owner is just the nicest guy. I have been eating there for a couple of years and have never been disappointed.	5	Samosa Factory	4
Oh so disappointed. Everyone raves about this place so we finally tried it and were let down. We were seated in the corner and totally forgotten about. We ordered the tom yum soup and it was bland and barely had anything in it. It was more like a bowl of broth. The masaman was watery and flavorless. In my opinion they cant compare to Pin Kaow on Lake Mead and Rainbow.	2	Archi's Thai Cafe	3.5
Roy's is one of the best off-strip restaurants in Vegas. The butterfish is my favorite menu item. There are parts of the menu that change every three months which is really nice. They also have an email club you can sign up for and they will notify you when the seasonal menu has changed and sometimes they send you $20 coupons. Definitely worth a try.	4	Roy's Restaurant	4.5
The food here is pretty bland and the menu is very limited. I find it to be overpriced and over hyped. The owners used to own the Samosa Factory and I ate there when they were still the owners and it was great. Then they sold it and opened up Indian Curry Bowl right by my house and I was excited. But when I tried the food I was more than disappointed. The samosas were bland and the korma was watered down tasting. The owner isnt always the nicest guy either. Forget about special ordering anything. If you are looking for good indian food i would go to the little place on Sahara and Decatur that they used to own.	1	Indian Curry Bowl	3
"Ugh. I have to say that the Olive Garden is the most consistently crappy restaurant around. It's far from good Italian and everything seems as if it was just poured from a bag and heated up. No matter what Olive Garden I've been to in the country, they're always the same. This is not a good sign. It means that there is one company making all of the food for all of the locations, which means that nothing is fresh.
I was in an Olive Garden once and some teenagers at a nearby table ran out on their bill and the waitress said that she is personally responsible for paying their bill. If this is the case I do not want to support a company with those kind of policies. Especially because of the amount of money that the Olive Garden makes every year."	1	Olive Garden Italian Restaurant	3.5
"The food is okay. My biggest complaint is the fact that the restaurant and bar area are attached. There is supposed to be no smoking since its considered a family establishment. But I went there at around 8:00 for dinner people at the bar were smoking and the staff said nothing. It totally ruined my experience and I wreaked of cigarettes when I left. 
However, if you're a smoker you might really like the place."	2	Shucks Tavern & Oyster Bar	3.5
The food here isn't bad, but it's also not my favorite. The sauces are a little strange., but I think it's because of the region the food is from. I'm just not used to it. I really like the corn tortilla quesadilla that is on the appetizer menu. I tried to order a vegetarian burrito and they brought me a burrito that was just filled with grilled peppers and onions, like the veggies that come with fajitas. It was inedible, but they made up for it with the live music. There is something totally awesome about a Mexican version of Radiohead's "Creep". I have to idea why the guy played it but it was hilarious. That alone made it worth the meal.	3	Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant	3.5
I have had some of the best food ever at B&B. I loved the wild boar papardelle. The lamb's brain ravioli was surprisingly delicious and the branzino was great. The only thing that was questionable was the tripe Parmesan, but I just simply didn't like the texture. Some people who are familiar with tripe might like it. All of the food was well cooked and had great flavors. If you are a picky eater I wouldn't necessarily recommend B&B. But if you like complex food it's a great place.	5	B&B Ristorante	3.5
The food here is good, but nothing fantastic. The prices are reasonable and the portions are fair for what you pay. The fried rice and yaki soba are pretty good. I would avoid the appetizer items because they are saturated with oil and are too greasy too eat. Its worth a try.	3	Teriyaki Madness	4
This is the best late-night, too drunk to function place to eat. I have been there after concerts a few times and always love it. The food is reasonably priced and the selection is good. Its a great place to go with a group of people. I never leave unhappy, but that could be because I've only eaten there when I'm drunk.	3	Mr. Lucky's 24-7	3.5
Sen is hands down my favorite sushi place in Vegas. The fluke is my favorite and they have some really good scallop sashimi. The sushi rice is perfect which is the ultimate test of a sushi place. The miso soup is by far the best and the shishito peppers are tasty. They have a large list of rolls and if you want a roll that is not on the menu they will make you a custom one. They do some interesting specials, I have tried jellyfish with jalapeño  which was good. And if not everyone at the table likes sushi they also have some great chicken and steak dishes. They do happy hour after 10pm and are open until after 1am.   I am extremely picky when it comes to sushi and I dislike most places, but Sen never disappoints. They are nothing like your average neighborhood sushi joint. Don't let the people who have given negative reviews effect you trying this place.	5	Sen of Japan	4.5
Market grill cafe is alright. The food isn't the most authentic or highest quality, but its still good. I like the spanikopita and the baklava cheesecake. Unfortunately the gyro meat is only ok. It has a weird taste and it is always mushy, never crispy. The falafel is dry and bland and pretty gritty. There is definitely better greek food in town, especially for the price.	3	Market Grille Cafe	4
"Paymon's is not bad at all. They have one of the best falafel around. It's green and flavorful and not dry at all. I especially like the Athens fries which are french fries that have been tossed is seasonings and served with a spiced dip. So good. I recommend the rice pudding for dessert.
The hookah lounge is connected to the restaurant but separated. I went in there one time and smoked after dinner. The tobacco tasted great but I immediately regretted my decision because I threw up. So I would recommend eating after smoking. But I am not a smoker so Im not used to the tobacco."	3	Paymons Mediterranean Cafe & Hookah Lounge	3.5
"I have been eating at Pin Kaow for at least 8 years. I think it's the best Thai food in the city. I have only eaten at the original location on Lake Mead and Rainbow so I don't know how the other locations are, but this one is great. People have told me that they prefer Archie's, but I thought it was terrible. Pin Kaow is pretty consistent and with all of the remodeling the decor is nice. I use Pin Kaow as a standard to compare all other Thai places to, and I have never found one that I like as much, not even in other cities.
I recommend the shrimp rolls, Tom Ka Koong soup, and the Pad Woon Sen. Oh, and of course the Thai tea."	5	Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant	4
Hash House A Go Go is pretty good for breakfast. They have a wonderful buttermilk pancake. Its the size of a hub cap and I order it with extra fresh strawberries. The biscuits and gravy is pretty good too. Its fresh biscuits with sausage gravy served over mashed potatoes. The best things about the Hash House are the fresh jam on every table and the fresh squezed tangerine juice. I honestly dont care for their lunch menu at all. But breakfast is what its all about there.	4	Hash House A Go Go	4
The quality of the food is great. The complimentary french fries cooked in duck fat are amazing. The Japanese A-5 Kobe filet was crazy good, although expensive. And I recommend the passion fruit panna cotta. It is the best dessert I have ever had. I love this place so much that I chose it for my wedding night.	5	StripSteak	4
The king crab legs are really good. You can get them warm or chilled and they open them at the table for you so the work is done. The stone crab claws are fantastic, especially when they have the giant ones available. They have good, quality seafood and steaks. I have been there many times and have always left happy.	4	Joes Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab	4.5
"I was totally disappointed with this place. The service was terrible. The waitress made us really uncomfortable. She was sort of off-putting and acted personally offended when we said we didnt want dessert. The food was nothing to be excited about. The chicken was untrimmed and full of weird hard bits, which ordinarily wouldnt be a problem, but this place is sort of pricey. The owner used to own a place on Lake Mead called Marc's and I really liked it. So when this place opened up I was looking forward to trying it. Ugh, not even close to being the same.

*****Just found out that the owner of Marc's is no longer at Mezzo and is now at Parma."	2	Mezzo Bistro and Wine	4
Chicago Joe's is good, inexpensive, simple Italian food. They have a great meatball sandwich and the marinara was so good. The prices are very reasonable and the employees are all friendly. The location is my only problem since I'm never in the area, but if I have to go downtown they're definitely a stop for me. I would absolutely recommend them.	4	Chicago Joe's	4
Vegas is good food at a good price. Everything is made fresh and the food is not greasy or heavy at all. The chile relleno is one of my favorites. My only complaint is that they dont have any pork dishes. They have a great breakfast menu that they serve all day. And the apple burrito is pretty good.	4	Vega's Cafe	4
The food at Aureole is fantastic. And if you're a wine lover this is a great place. The Kobe tasting menu was amazing. If you're looking for a nice restaurant for an anniversary or other special occasion Aureole would be a great option.	5	Aureole	3.5
"Had lunch at Morel's in the Palazzo yesterday. I wasn't terribly hungry, so Ijust ordered the crispy prawns appetizer. The waiter didn't seem disturbed as some do when I order an appetizer as my meal. MY husband had the turkey club & fries. 

The service was great. The prawns were very crispy and cooked perfectly. Mike said his club sandwich was very good. 

We will most likely have breakfast there in the next day or two."	5	Morels French Steakhouse & Bistro	3.5
"I've eaten a late night apring roll appetizer when our flight was delayed getting in to Vegas. The food was excellent, the services was so-so.

Next morning, my husband & I had breakfast from the menu before I headed off to my  conference. I took 30 minutes to get our food. Again, the food was very good, but the service was so-so. 

Today, we had breakfast from the buffet and it was very good. Again, the service was so-so, except for the persons working the buffet area. The guy making the omelets there was excellent.

It has not been terribly crowded on the times we've been there. Longest wait time to get seated was about 5 minutes. The wait staff just seem uninterested in their jobs..."	4	Grand Lux Cafe	4
"We had lunch there today. We had peach-pomegranite lemonade. It was so good, we got some to go. We shared the stuffed mushroom appetizer and shared the chicken Florentine. Both dishes were awesome! Our server was friendly and did not care in the least that we were not having alcohol for lunch or that we were sharing in order not to feel stuffed when we left. 

We have eaten at Maggiano's in Atlanta a couple of times and the service and food was not this good.

We would definitely eat here again."	5	Maggiano's Little Italy	4
"We had dinner there tonight. It is extremely quiet for a casino restaurant . The service was very great. I had the appetizer sampler plate and my husband, Mike had the stir fried with shrimp and crispy garlic. He had cold tea and I had hot tea. Clean environment. Fantastic, clean-tasting, crisp food, not oily and overly salty.

Definitely recommend!"	5	Zine Noodles Dim Sum	3
"My husband stopped in to have a light meal before attending a show. Wait time for us was about 20 minutes. We ordered appetizers because we didn't want to be over-full during the show. When I ordered, our waitress all but huffed at us. She rarely stopped at our table to see if we needed anything even though she had to pass our table to get to the kitchen\/bar area. I noticed a similar attitude displayed to her other customers. The other servers seemed friendlier to their customers. The busser seemed more concerned with our well being than our wait chick. 

We will not eat there again and do not recommend it."	2	Gilley's	3
"SO AMAZING. The vegetarian options are delicious, we were all so impressed! Really authentic, especially for being in Las Vegas!
Oh, and their salsa! Too good. We'll be back without a doubt before we head back to Dallas."	5	Viva Las Arepas	4.5
Delicious pizza! Best 24 hour pizza this side of the Grand Canyon.  Plus if you're a guest in a hotel they bring you paper plates and napkins, heard dat.	5	Cafe Verdi	3
"If you are actually hungry skip this place and head over to Hubert's Burger Bar restaurant instead.

The food was tasty but bite sized and the price is very high for what you are getting....throw in the fact they charge you for refills on soda and bread and I will say...pass. Too many choices of great restaurants to settle for this...

OVERRATED."	2	Fleur by Hubert Keller	4
"Straight up this Buffet kinda sucks...sorry Aria, I gave you 5 stars as a hotel\/casino but your Buffet  blows...

Food was all kinda over cooked and crusty, sushi was gross, they have some kinda Indian tandoori station that was awful....the only saving grace was the desert section. Next time I will just hit the cafe or one of the other 7 restaurants in the place....or even just order room service."	2	The Buffet at ARIA	3
"I have been here four times and the food is consistently very good and I have found the service to be pretty good as well. If you come in for dinner on a weekend then yes they will be busy so may want to make a reservation. It is a good place to eat so you can't waltz up with 15 people and expect to get seated in 10 min (reading some of these reviews make me laugh)....

AP:Bread sticks and olive tapenade is yummy to munch on with a cocktail
AP:Calamari was good, included lightly battered zucchini and great spicy marinara sauce.
Soup: Minestrone is very good and a good portion. 
Pasta: I liked the Bucatini which was in a spicy tomato and pancetta sauce. Hearty and good.
Main: Chicken Piccata - my favorite dish here is served with a side of angel hair pasta. Three breasts served with lemon butter sauce and capers....melts in your mouth. Best I have ever had I can honestly say.

At the Bar: Margarita Pizza with a glass of house Merlot...Yum."	4	Lupo by Wolfgang Puck	3.5
Great nachos.  Friendly service.  We will definitely come back again.  The surrounding area is not the best but it is good once you are there.	4	Nacho Daddy Downtown	4
Service was a bit slow but friendly.  Nachos were GREAT.  We would come again for sure!	4	Nacho Daddy	4
Very good buffet.  Price is pretty reasonable also compared to others on the strip.  I would come again.	4	The Buffet at Luxor	2.5
very disappointed.  Ive eaten at a lot of Farmer boys in California and I know their burgers are  very good....but  I stopped for a breakfast burrito ok it was $6.09 but it should be big and good well it was small very small and very dry not enough cheese not enough hashbrowns alltogether DRY and SMALL for $6!!! what  a rip   I hope I get over it by my next trip out there so I can enjoy a farmer boys burger  DONT get the breakfast burrito  not worth $2    very disapointed.	1	Farmer Boys	3.5
"I love this place! We keep going back for more garlic knots and Biaggio's homemade sauce straight from his Aunt Angelina! The environment is very friendly and the customer service is impeccable! 

We have tried the sandwiches, pizza's, salads, garlic knots, and best of all---the Stromboli! Everything feels very high quality. :)"	5	Biaggio's Pizzeria	4.5
"In town once a year always take business friends with me, great food and service.
Looking forward to next years meal."	5	Roma Deli 1 & Restaurant	4.5
It's not that the pizza was delivered cold and tasted like the cardboard box it came in the problem the driver was short on change so she said I'll go get change and bring you your $15 back will be less than 10 minutes she said we waited for 30 called the store they said she will be back in 10 min waited another 20 called the store again and again they said she will be there in 20 so they deliver crap food and blatantly steal your money.     Beware of this place and drivers absolutely positively do not give them cash if you have a delivery don't do it they are thieves and will rip you off flat out stole our cash !!! Maybe pay your employees more if they resort to stealing peoples money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! .         After 2 hours the lady came back with my cash after the owner called me the crazy thing about it is the lousy ass person still kept the tip I just had to slam the door in her face again beware employees can make or break a business and obviously this place has the worst employees drivers anyway. FYI The karate guy I talk to on the phone he was kind of cool though...... wow another update..... now the restaurant has there piece of crap employees calling us and harassing us I just had to make a threat to them I'll call the police for harassment unreal please please be aware of this place !!!!!!!!!	1	Sicily's Pizza	2
Been here several times for breakfast\/brunch, most recently 2x for Thanksgiving. Love their coffee and croque madame. Absolutely delicious. Good breakfast in LV will set you back a pretty penny anyways so if you spend, spend it on Bouchon. Service is very pleasant, other than the hostesses who always seem to behave like they hold keys to heaven. Not specific to this place, most upscale restaurants have this issue. Bar staff is super friendly and likes to have a good conversation. Also met some great people during brunch, so it's never a disappointment. Also, last time they didn't turn away customers who showed up at closing time after brunch which speaks volumes for their level of service. Oh yea, and with a paid receipt from the bistro you get 25% off Bouchon bakery purchase which is facing the strip. Nice treat.	5	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
My husband and I stopped by to eat there ( AYCE) about 3 weeks ago. From the moment we walked in the staff was very friendly and helpful! The sushi and rolls came out so quickly!( and they were pretty busy) We were so impressed! We've been back several times since then , and brought friends each time! It's our new sushi place on this side of town!	5	Sushi Kaya	3.5
Orders the fingers, 8" cheese pizza, garlic balls.  Yuk, the fingers are pre frozen, pre packaged with some kind of corn mill mush coating and very, very greasy.. The pizza was fro a 5 year old who loves pizza, he eat one peace  and would not eat anymore. They say the fingers are large, nope, they are just as big as any other place has them . Never will we ever eat at this place again.. Five thumbs down...	1	Angelina's Pizzeria	2.5
Worst place ever! I loved this place before. But now I don't go anymore! food is not good but service is bad! We ordered cold soba but broth was warm. So we asked to make cold or change the broth. But after 5 min. they served same broth as we gave before! and that day we found cockroach: ( so I don't go anymore!	2	Shuseki	3.5
"Abuela's Tacos is awesome! The handmade tortillas are the bomb and totally make the taco. The nacho's were really tasty as well. Everything tastes fresh and authentic. 

The environment is nice too. I'm pretty sure the owners 17 year old daughter was running the place, but she was so nice and professional. All the food was served quickly and I can't complain!"	5	Abuela's Tacos	4.5
"Wow. That is all I can say....

Tacos El Gordo will knock your taste buds into an all out Mexican frenzy of goodness! If you want the best taco, get in line for the spicy pork that is freshly shaved off of the skewer. They top it with cilantro, onion, and a creamy cilantro sauce, and also pineapple if you choose--it is heaven in your mouth...seriously! My boss shared the news about this place and I have taken my whole family now! The carne asada is really good too--a little on the spicy side, but still great. It has guacamole, onion, cilantro, and a red sauce. The best part is that you can taste the flame grill on the carne asada!

I promise if you go to Tacos El Gordo, you will not regret it!!!!"	5	Tacos El Gordo	4.5
"The previous reviews of Red Rock Pizza really threw me off! I purchased a Groupon for this place and was anxious to use it!

Initially, I was a little annoyed because it was really far away from my home in the Southwest. I was impressed by the nice open kitchen--I like being able to see how they are preparing my food. We ordered a HUGE--I mean HUGE pepperoni pizza, garlic knots, salad, and bomb.com cookie. The pizza was pretty good...the crust was crispy, and it had a good amount of cheese:pepperoni ratio. The garlic knots were okay, I have had better. The salad was the most impressive part! It was HUGE for only $3.99 and the ranch was yummy. It was spicy! 

The cookie...please, try the cookies they have. I thought they were muffins when I saw them on the counter, but the nice girl who told me to try one was one smart girl! They had huge chunks of belgian chocolate and were ooey gooey perfection!

Overall, I would go back!"	4	Red Rock Pizza	3.5
"If you have tried Texas De Brazil, don't even attempt to compare it to Pampas. I was sorely disappointed with Pampas. The meats were average and they didn't come around to our table as often as others, and the salad bar was a joke. It felt like cafeteria food. They claim to be a true Brazilian steakhouse, but all the main Brazilian fare was so underwhelming. 

What was most disappointing was the service. I can get over the bad food, but the service ruined the entire night. We were seated in the center section and there was only one server working the entire thing...there had to be at least 15 tables she was serving. It took 35 minutes just to get our check and no one even asked about our experience. 

My advice: spend a little extra money and go to Texas De Brazil!!!"	2	Pampas Churrascaria Brazilian Grille	3
"I don't do this very often here on Yelp, but I literally just arrived home from Rambo's Kitchen and had to write this review. First off, the staff was friendly and the location is great, right next to our house off Fort Apache and 215. I had been following reviews on this place for a while and had pretty good expectations built up. 

As we arrived, I saw on the door that it was ""All You Can Eat Fish and Chips"" night for $12.95. Score, I thought! As we were seated, I took a quick glance at the menu and noticed that with ordering these fish and chips came some stipulations. No sharing, no coupons, no specials, and 1 hour maximum eating time. I wasn't overly hungry and didn't care about the time--I was looking to gorge myself on fish and chips, but just enjoy a nice dinner. This all didn't sound so bad...until...

My first basket arrived. 2 pieces of fish, a dinky container of pasta salad and a decent amount of fries. When I say dinky container, I mean like the container they serve your salad dressing in. Overall, the fish was okay--pretty greasy, but what can you expect with a 1960's diner-esq place. The waitress was nice and saw I was about to start on the 2nd piece of fish, and she put in another order. About 20 minutes later...out came a basket with 1 piece of fish in it. Seriously...1 piece!! I actually laughed and said is this really ""all you can eat?"" At this rate, the maximum amount of fish I would be able to order would probably top off at 2. I ended up not even eating the fish, we asked for the check, and walked out.

Overall, if you are looking to sign a verbal contract with your order and feel like the staff is watching your significant other with hawk eyes to make sure he\/she isn't reaching into your basket, then by all means, go to Rambo's Kitchen. Other Yelper's had nice experiences, and I can honestly see the potential, but I was embarrassed to be served in such a way.

You live, you learn, and you never go back to Rambo's Kitchen."	2	Rambo's Kitchen	3.5
"What thoughts do the name Spicy Pickle conjure in your hungry little head? Picture this; rockin' panninis, homemade pasta salad, fresh salads, and happy workers--all with a giant pickle on the side!

Overall, Spicy Pickle was a nice experience for a new chain restaurant. I went in during rush lunch hour on a Tuesday and placed a to-go order that took a little longer than expected, but was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food. Meh, it may be a little pricey, but it was worth it!

Plus, the Spicy Pickle sign just makes me happy! Who loves giant pickels?! I DO! :)"	4	Spicy Pickle	3
This place was absolutely delicious. I just had the gyro, but there was just the right amount of everything. Definitely a new regular eat out restaurant.	4	Yassou	4.5
A perfect anytime restaurant for every kind of customer. Five delicious bowls of hot ramen to choose from, Four incredibly satisfying rice dishes to share with the table, and a delicious cold noodle dish to mix things up a little bit. Monta is affordable, tasty and can accommodate groups just as well as yourself for a simple and honest meal.	4	Monta Ramen	4
New place ~6 months. First time here. AMAZING. Pretty good quality for dimsum by the strip. The service is phenomenal, they were very on top of everything. Would recommend and would come back.	5	Yum Cha	4
The food was excellent, but I am not willing to give 5 stars due to a couple of things that are easy to fix yet were not. First the Soda was flat as water and instead of bringing me another Soda one with let's just call it fizz, they made me wait over 15 minutes just to say would you rather have lemonade! I thought they were putting in another CO2 bottle. The food arrived hot and fresh! Very tasty and each burger looked like a little masterpiece! My last gripe is it took 20 minutes to get our check, this was after they cleared our table. At the end of the day food was great, service was sub-par Gordon should have been there lighting a fire under their Ass!	3	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
"Ordered a pizza for delivery - they said 45 - 60 minutes - 2 hours later we called and we get some excuse that the drivers car was broken but it was on it way with a new driver. Called Domino's - not the greatest pizza but at least it shows up in a half hour.   After several calls and excuses pizza finally shows up 3 hours late. And way after domino's.  

They did comp the food - but it was middle of the road."	1	Milano's Pizza	2.5
"Not the greatest but not the worst. 

Maybe it was the time of day that I came in, or just really good luck, but it wasn't that bad. I grew tired of waiting for Yama Sushi nearby and I was starving, so I decided to get something fast and cheap. After reading the other reviews, I followed some tips that helped me avoid any potential food poisoning and resulted in an enjoyable experience. 

1) Food is a C+. For better Chinese food, look elsewhere, like Chinatown
2) Stick with the hot foods. I was afraid of the sushi and avoided it like the plague
3) Mongolian style stir fry was pretty good. The shrimp was fresh, along with the veggies. Unfortunately, the lady who cooked it looked unhappy, like she was there as an indentured servant and had nowhere else to go. 
4) The fresh fruits were decent and plentiful. I avoided the other desserts.
5) The orange chicken and vermicelli noodles were pretty decent and better than Panda Express. 
6) If you happen to come when all the Chinese tour buses come in, the food will be refilled constantly and it was very fresh for me. Nothing at room temperature and tasted fine 

This place reminds me of all the other C+ rated chinese buffets in LA. Nothing special about it. You get what you pay for. And luckily I didn't pay for a stomachache."	3	Lee's Buffet	2
Come check out this restaurant they have ayce Korean BBQ and sushi.  YUP!!! "BBQ & SUSHI"!!! AT THE SAME TIME! Serious Food coma!  Food quality was good and The sushi was fresh. The BBQ was a little oily probably because they oil the grill but other than that everything was good. If you ever come out here ask for Derek he's an awesome server and very attentive.	4	Biwon Korean BBQ & Sushi Restaurant	4
Created a yelp account just so i can give this place "5stars"! This is my 3rd visit here in10 days....goes without saying this is amazing. The food is to die for and the service is beyond excellent! Always leave here full and happy! Oh and JJ's the best!!! :)	5	Jjanga Japanese Restaurant	4
Came in craving for Udon soup but ended up doing AYCE. For the entire month of October their AYCE is only $19.99. But I would come back and pay regular price. The sushi was really good and the fish was really FRESH. All the side dishes were delicious also. The kitchen was little backed up but no biggie all the food came out hot. Come check them out especially during this promo.	4	Hanabi	4
I've been wanting to visit this restaurant for years and it was worth the wait.  The food was delicately prepared and arranged- beautiful presentations tend to make you savor and sample. And the butterfish!  It tastes exactly how it sounds. Our server was very versed, knowledgeable, and friendly. Small intimate setting. It is nice to know that Las Vegas has places like this that put a delicious and thought-out spin on what a typical meal consists  of.	5	Roy's Restaurant	4.5
Good lord these burgers are good!  I like classic foods with a twist, and they supply.  I can't remember what burger it was, but I know it had brie, sprouts, and horseraddish...YES.  As far as service, nothing was exceptional because I can't exactly remember it....thinking too much about my awesome edibles.  And I love the way it's decorated, very inspiring.  Five stars!	5	LBS Burger	3.5
Delicious! Meat lovers and vegetarians will all like Triple George. There is a pretty wide selection of fair for the size of the menu. Everything is cooked and seasoned just right. Clearly, someone in the kitchen knows what they are doing. The onion soup is perfect and the blackberry martini is fun. The service can be on the slower side, but I don't think that most people go there for a quick meal. I like how it is classy \/ casual, meaning that you can dress up a bit, but don't have to go all out. I will certainly be back and bring friends with me.	5	Triple George Grill	4
Reasonable prices and great food. Service was quick and the food was fresh. Definitely recommend the corned beef reuben and truffle tater tots.	5	The Henry	4
Cuban sandwiches and coffee. Yummy! The pasteries are great, too, if  you like the flakey kind. My biggest complaint is that they take a very, very long time to get a to-go order ready. It took over half an hour to get a freaking sandwich made. If you aren't in a hurry and love a good Cuban bakery, this is a good one. I would go there again.	4	Roly's Bakery	3.5
Best bartender that I've ever had the pleasure of. This guy knows his art. How refreshing it is to have someone know how to make a drink the "right way". The ambiance is nice and there are a few regular locals that are interesting to talk to in the evening hours. I like this so much better than some of the clubby, ridiculousness that you might find on the Strip. This is the spot to come to relax and take a load off for a while.	4	Mob Bar	4
This place is looking pretty good these days, especially for those that want to stay in Vegas, but away from the strip. It is right downtown, right by Fremont street. It is comfortable and pretty classy. It is more of the kind of place that the locals would recommend.	4	Downtown Grand Hotel & Casino, An Ascend Hotel Collection Member	3.5
"There isn't anything wrong with Broadway Burger, per say, but there isn't anything awesome about it either. They have a decent selection of burgers and salads that you can customize. If you are familiar with The Counter, it is sort of like that, but not as awesome.

The service is really friendly and accommodating. I ended up giving my server a really generous tip because she did such an awesome job with a smile. 

The food gets the job done, but it really is nothing to write home about. I felt that I could have done better for my vacation. Then again, I'm not a big burger person and mostly went there because a friend wanted to get a chicken burger (that she didn't like). Meh."	3	Broadway Burger Bar & Grill	3.5
"Oh My Smorgy Heaven! There is soooo much fooooood here! All of it, every single bit was perfection! I was happily ashamed and disgusted with myself after eating myself silly. There really is something here for everyone. I am trying to think of a diet that couldn't be humored at Bacchanal and I'm not coming up with any.

So it is expensive and you have to make a reservation at the kiosky thing. The day that I went, my party didn't think to call ahead and we were so sad to be told it was at least two hours wait...unless we paid an extra $20. I will admit, we paid it. It was worth it to get in right away and not mess up our whole day waiting around or skipping an epic-sized meal. 

I will be back, oh yes. I will be back."	5	Bacchanal Buffet	4
I'm pretty sure that the secret is out because the line was all the way down the hall and around the corner. However, I get why people are willing to wait in a line like that at 2AM. This pizza is exactly what you need in the middle of the night before passing out or rallying before hitting up another club. It is pretty pricey for one slice, but whatever, it is Vegas Strip. I will be coming here for every Vegas trip from now on because its just the kind of place that you have to hit up.	4	Secret Pizza	4
"I came here during the week of Christmas last year, which was the opening week of The Cosmopolitan. For such an upscale and luxurious casino, you would think that their restaurants have to be top-notch and at their best. Unfortunately, that was not the case when I went.

The Good: $20 for lunch at a very nice place is not that bad. There was a variety of food, most of which were served in individual plates, which is different compared to most other buffets in Vegas that serve their food in big trays for you to scoop out of. There was a good selection of meats (definitely try the lamb if you can), a small sushi bar, some dim sum, and other kinds of food -- they all varied in excellence. There are unusual foods which I have not seen at other buffets before, one of them being pork belly fat wrapped inside a flour bun. Nonetheless, the food was presented beautifully, just like the decor around the buffet (curly-glass chandeliers and beautiful silverware). The dessert selection was amazing, and it's not like any other dessert selection you see at other buffets. There were macaroons, chocolate slates, mini chocolate-covered apples (each is unique with different toppings), gelato, unusual tarts sitting in egg shells, and chocolate covered strawberries. You can tell that they put a lot of effort into individually making each piece of dessert.

The Bad: My number one complaint here would be the staff. Although friendly as they were, they were not prepared as they should be, both in terms of handling food AND as waiters. Our waiter approached our table saying, ""My name is uh, ____. *Long pause* I am going to be your server today."" It seemed pretty obvious he was trying to remember his lines, which should have been perfected before the grand opening of such a high-class casino. Not only that, but he DISAPPEARED after giving us our drinks and NEVER CAME BACK to check up on us or refill our drinks. Our glasses were empty after a while and we had to call on a random staff to refill it for us. As we were eating, we heard a big clash near the kitchen door and found that the same staff member just dropped the tray with our drinks on it. Another clash was heard later on, for another staff had dropped another tray on the floor. Our finished plates literally filled up the entire table before the staff took it away. Also, the place lacked fruits, which I think is essential at a buffet.

Overall: I feel that this buffet has so much potential, but just lacks the proper staffing experience and some food quality\/selection at the moment. If you're reading this review in the future, hopefully the staff will be more prepared and the food choices will open up just a little by then. I am a little bit curious myself to see much they will improve in a few months' time."	3	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"Like almost all of the other reviewers said, this place definitely is a sibling of Cheesecake Factory. You can tell by its decor as well as the menu (there were a lot of dishes that were the same from Cheesecake Factory). 

Service: Once I walked in, there was a nice ambiance around me, and we were seated immediately. Our waiter was very helpful and made sure we were comfortable with our food and kept checking up on us every so often.

Food: For appetizers, I ordered the spinach dip -- pretty good. I ordered the pasta with chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and mushrooms, hoping that since this restaurant is from Cheesecake Factory, it would taste the same as the dish I usually order at CF. I was somewhat wrong. The cream sauce Grand Lux uses for that dish has a rather distinct\/weird taste, and I didn't like it enough to finish the plate.

I definitely would come here again to try the other dishes. The pricing is pretty decent too. Also, I hear it's open late (although the Grand Lux at The Venetian opens 24 hrs), so that's definitely a plus for people who are dancing the night away and get a little rumble in their stomach.

Brandon M.  Took amazing care of us for our 20th anniversary.  He made a fabulous recommendation that allowed us to sample virtually everything on the menu!  Every single item was delicious!  I don't like guacamole but yet I loved theirs!  My husband and I were able to try dishes we wouldn't have ever ordered but LOVED!  The ceviche course - perfection!  The scallop and shrimp soup\/rice dish - amazing!  I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough or Brandon!  He was so sweet to send us home with anniversary desserts since we were beyond stuffed.  Thank you Brandon!	5	Border Grill	4
"I think we can all agree that the food is good at Cafe Rio. I personally like it better than Chipotle. The service at this location isn't great though. 

In the past, when I go there the cashiers always gave us attitude and you'd wait on them to finish talking to their coworkers about life or whatever before ringing you up while a long line continues to build behind. 

One time they pissed me off like never before. The cashier gave me so much attitude, they kept messing up my order, and when I got home there was hair in my food!! (I called back, spoke to the manager, and got a free burrito the next time I came, but like I was angry, tired and starving when I got home and couldn't even eat my food)

Anyways they've gotten better with their service it's mediocre, and the food is still the same. So props to them on improving, but the Henderson location is still much better. It looks nicer, they have better drinks and the employees try harder there."	3	Cafe Rio	2.5
This place is by far the best boba spot in town! There are a wide variety of drinks to choose from, my personal favorite is rose milk tea with boba. The owner is very nice and accommodating, so are the rest of the employees. If you ever need any adjustments to your drink, the employees are happy to help. The boba has the perfect amount of sweetness and is not super chewy. They always make sure to ask if you like your drink to have regular sweetness, which just shows how perfect they want your drink to be. I have yet to try their crepes, but they look delicious. Make sure to keep your stamp cards, buy ten and get one free! I go through them about once a month. Good price point, nice location, fast service, don't know what place could beat Brew Tea!	5	Brew Tea Bar	5
I really like this place! The employees are nice over here. The food is delicious and truthfully I'm not that much of a seafood person. My favorite part is the sushi burrito lunch specials. Only $5! And most of the time I just eat half and save the rest for another meal later. The place is really clean and they even offer some free drinks. This place is by far my favorite poke bowl place!	4	POKE POKU  Hawaiian Poke bar	4.5
If I'm craving a refreshing drink with lychee jelly, this place is my go to. My favorite is the White Coconut Latti with lychee jelly. It's cute inside, a quaint little cafe. I've seen people study and just hang out there. I often go with my boyfriend for a quick date. My large family will come in every once in a while around 10pm and just chill there talking. It's nice. For dessert the raindrop cakes taste good! Love the original flavor, it's like a clear little jello.	4	Loftti Cafe	4.5
"My family ordered Uber Eats from here once, it was pretty good. We ended up eating at the actual location today and we aren't coming back. I'm not going to sugar coat it, the service was terrible. 

We walk in and the lady (who I assume is part owner or something?) tells us to sit down. She asks us what drinks we want, notices that we have water bottles just says ""No drinks"" and immediately leaves. Leaving us confused if we can or cannot drink the water we brought.

We decide what to order and ding the bell on the table (a bit strange in my opinion, but the lady did say to ring it). She gives us a quick glance, serves the other table of 1, seats another table who just got there, and takes the new table's order. Then finally gets to us (a table of 4, and we had already been there for 20 mins).

She asks us what we want, we tell her as she is rushing through getting our order (and the place isn't even busy!). Most of my table asked if they could also get drinks. Her response was ""you can go get it.""

5 mins go by and the table who came in 15 mins after us gets their food. Great. We proceed to wait another 15 mins and get our food. Each dish had problems. Also, my dad's seaweed salad never showed up and my mom's whole entree was nowhere to be found until she asked 10 mins later. The server completely forgot to tell the chefs, and it's another 10 mins to get her food. By now my mom doesn't even want it. We spent so long at this place waiting even though there were barely any customers and the orders went missing\/got messed up. No wonder they were empty.

To top it all off though, when we finally get the bill the place is empty and she asks for a tip!! Nope. We usually tip well since we know what it's like to be a server. I know she was trying I guess, but not once did she at least apologize or acknowledge that she messed up multiple times. We know good service when we see it and that was far from it."	2	Teppan Bento	4.5
This is one of my favorite places for All You Can Eat Sushi. Good service and great food. They actually have a new menu now which is still just as great. My favorite roll is the Threesome Special. Their rolls are not filled with too much rice to try to get you full fast unlike some other places. Love their green tea ice cream and green tea mochi!	4	Jjanga Steak & Sushi	4.5

Ordered take-out. Food arrived hot and tasted good. Surprised how good and hot the food was. Ordered egg foo yung, HK noodles, combination fried rice and the Pu Pu platter.

"Best chicken wings, mongolian beef and kung pow hands down.  

mind you I love spicy food.  I always order the food extra spicy and they comply with my requests perfectly.  While i wait they offered me a free soda.  And they have always greeted me with a smile.  

Not to mention they are clean and quick!

They do charge a little bit more for their entrees than other places, but it's well worth it for the service."	5	China A Go Go	3.5
"Didn't try the food.  

In fact, I went as they had their grand opening with the thought of ordering food for the family.  As they are picky eaters, I looked at the menu.  The menu was not  as diverse as some, and knowing that some restaurants will special order food for you or modify a recipe, I asked if they could make something that was not on the menu.  Rather than saying they could not, the comment was made with a very rude tone, ""My chef is an authentic Chinese Chef and what you are ordering is not Chinese, but something made up for Americans.  He won't make that.""  It wasn't what he said, but how he said it and with such disdain that I will never darken the doorstep of this restaurant again."	1	BaBa's Chinese Kitchen	2.5
"KBBQ is kinda my ""thing"".  I've been to every AYCE place in town.  They all have their advantages\/disadvantages.  Biwon ONLY has one negative:  the pork belly.  Pretty bland and flavorless.  BUT the Bulgogi was by far THE best I've encountered in town!  The Kim chi was perfection.  And oh the Shrimp Poppers (double order)!  The service...I do not have enough words to speak of Devi.  Devi was intuitive:  never had to ask for refills on my tea and came before we needed to order more food, had the BEST professional yet personal attitude of any waitstaff I have ever experienced.  When I go back again, I'm sitting in her section.  We love you, Devi!  You are what made the experience fantastic!!!!

All the food was fresh and seasoned to perfection (with the exception of the pork belly).  Maybe it was just an off day.  We went for lunch and sushi.  I cannot speak to how good or bad the sushi was because I'm not a sushi fan, but the salmon on my friend's sushi appeared very fresh and almost was appetizing to even me.  The tempura was extremely tasty and who doesn't love green tea ice cream?  

Honestly, I didn't even need to upgrade to the all day option due to the extensive options available on both menus.  But I will have to one day to try out the spare ribs.  :)  

Good Food and Excellent Service!!!!!"	5	Biwon Korean BBQ & Sushi Restaurant	4
"This is the only place in town I've found that makes Egg Rolls correctly.  They are thick, full of flavor and not the 'spring rolls' that these restaurants tend to make nowadays.  That being said, the rest of their food pretty much stinks.  Their Kung Pow anything and Mongolian anything is very salty.  The Chow Mein is not saucy, just imagine spaghetti noodles with soy sauce only.  The Singapore noodles are fairly good, but you don't get a good amount for the price.  

This place is worth a trip for the egg rolls though.  When I go, I buy enough for a few days."	3	Golden China	3.5
"The only two things I purchase from this restaurant are the Egg Foo Young and Cashew Chicken.  Every thing else on the menu is substandard.  

The two things they do well, they do very well.  In fact, it's the best in town.  The protein is actually cooked within the pancake itself which lends to good texture.  It is made with mostly egg and not with a lot of flour and the gravy is not too salty and is just thick enough to make it a hearty meal.  The best part of the cashew chicken is the zucchini.  It's diced to perfection and not over cooked.  It's the perfect al dente.  

The one major negative is that twice, I've ordered a specific item and was told they had a special that was better.  I informed the waiter that I wanted what i ordered instead, and upon bringing my order home, I've found that they substituted my order for what they were attempting me to purchase.  I don't appreciate the bait and switch for what I believe was their attempt to get rid of a particular food.  

However, not finding good :Egg Foo Young made well anywhere else, I find I come back for more."	3	Fair View Chinese Cuisine	3.5
"I've read some of the reviews regarding this place and i have to say that I disagree with some of the posters.  

This place has one thing that I find I crave which is the Coconut Shrimp.  I'm not one for coconut because of the texture, but after trying this accidentally, I found that it was fantastic.  It had none of the texture of coconut, but all of the sweetness.  

I had the crab on seafood night several times and did not get sick as you hear others have.  

I find they have a good selection and have never disappointed me.  

In fact, I find that they go out of their way to make sure you never have a dirty dish on your table and always have fresh tea if you finish your pot."	3	Krazy Buffet	3
"Sadly, They are discontinuing the late night pricing.  For the price it was excellent.  But with the price hike, I'd prefer to go to Hwaro or Biwon.  

I came here twice within the last two months.  Once there was a hair UNDER the meat.  Ewwww..  And the last time I went, the service excellent, but the food was lacking flavor.  

These two reasons are a deal breaker since there are so many other places worthy in this town."	2	Tofu Hut	3.5
"Salty, incorrect orders, arguing with customer's at the counter and on the phone.  While i have not been treated badly by the employees here, I've been witness.  I just don't want it to be me on of these days.  

The foods ok, but nothing to rave about and clearly not made with love."	2	China Joe's	2
"This has got to be my favorite K BBQ place.  It's not as cheap as some and not as expensive as others, but good nonetheless.  I love to come here midweek at night.  There's not so many people so you don't leave smelling like K BBQ as there are fewer grills and they do space people out well so you have privacy.  Their selection of marinated meat is terrific although they do not have some sauces or sides you would expect for a restaurant of it's sort.  They do have many soups that others do not so that makes up for it.  The staff is quick to clean the grills and very courteous.  

I always get my money's worth here and no wait if you come at the right time."	4	Sura BBQ Buffet	3.5
"Went there for lunch and fyi this is based on only one visit.
Pros:  good margarita and good guacamole
Cons:  The carne asada burrito had too much rice and the meat was over cooked and dry.  The short rib tacos were a disappointment.  It wasn't really ""tacos"".  It was a mound of meat with corn tortillas on the side, not fried or dipped in hot oil.  The rice was bland and the refried beans were not only bland but tasted like they were canned refried beans.  And our guacamole appetizer was brought out after the entrees.  
I grew up along the border and have been eating Mexican food all my life and know good from bad.  I won't be going back."	3	Chayo Mexican Kitchen + Tequila Bar	3
"I come here at least once a week & they never let me down! The servers are always so friendly & attentive! The only thing I dislike is that the prices change every so often because it's based on market price! So you never really know how much you spend lol 

My usual is always a pond of shrimp, GARLIC BUTTER mild-medium. Some cooks make it spicier than others! And if I'm super hungry, I'll get crawfish as well in a separate bag just for the extra sauce!  w\/ Cajun fries or calamari!!!!! Definitely worth the try if you're a calamari lover like me! I do also sometimes get potatoes or corn on the side because you can never have enough extra sauce!!!! 

So if you're looking to try seafood, but a different kind of seafood... this is the place!"	5	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!!! I ordered online an hour before arrival. 3 hot n READY pizzas, bread sticks & Chicken wings. But here I am waiting with a room full of 18 people who have also not received their food! On top of having to wait for something that is claimed to be "HOT N READY" , I'm appalled by the rude service!!!! PLEASE WORK ON YOUR PEOPLE SKILLS. And please have your employees focus on the urgency of your customers. ESPECIALLY IN THIS HOT WEATHER!	1	Little Caesars Pizza	1.5
"If you want a place with great costumer service, this place is NOT it!! What was the point of creating a mobile order app if I was still going to have to wait 30 mins for my food? Let alone after receiving not one but TWO text messages saying my food was ready?! Also, people who were waiting in line and did not order yet received their food before I did?! What's even worse was when I asked an employee if my food was ready, she told me with a very rude attitude that my food is almost ready. 10mins later, I asked her again & she said ""mam, I already told you, your food would be coming out soon."" 

Let's just say their food was good, but it definitely WAS NOT WORTH THE WAIT OR THE RUDE COSTUMER SERVICE!"	1	Shake Shack	4
"I am extremely disappointed in this location. It was my first time coming to this location, keep in mind I go to Hot N Juicy once a week but at the three other locations. It really just depends what location I am closest to. We just so happened to be at PH at the time I was craving shrimp! 

Let's get back to the point! The lady upfront, her name is Ashley (Team Lead) was the rudest person I've ever encountered at any Hot N Juicy! First off, I understand you are busy and I understand it is very stressful! BUT DO NOT TELL ME OUR TABLE IS READY and have my family & I sit there for another 20-30 mins after already waiting almost an hour! And DO NOT tell me our table is ready when there is no one even cleaning our table. I had to tell 3 different servers why no one was cleaning the table we eventually got seated at! I eventually asked her why no one was cleaning our table & she responded ""well can't you see we are busy? We are short staff and our kitchen is backed up. I will get to your table in 10 minutes"" WHY WHY WHY tell me our table is ready????!!!!! If you were going to throw in my face that you're short staffed. Finally got a manager and asked her to clean the table because the lady up front told us our table was ready.. 

I am not one to doubt that they were all probably stressed because of the excessive amount of people there, but that does not give you a right to one give an attitude to your customers. I understand that we were a big party, but we were there before half the people she decided to seat before us! First come first serve right?! We waited over an hour and watched multiple people get seated before us! I am not impressed. I hope one day my opinion will change about this location. Sadly because I am someone's who loves this restaurant and their food! ‍"	1	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
My all time favorite Thai restaurant! I can never find a place that can beat their Chicken Larb or Curry or Pad Thai!!  Also, their Thai Tea is amazing, but I'd suggest getting it TOGO because it's bigger but for the same price! Oh speaking of price, they're fair price for allot of food. They servers are super friendly. I definitely come here at least once every two weeks!	5	Thai House	3.5
"As a person who comes to Bachi often & orders the exact same thing every single time, let's just say I don't appreciate the little dispute I had with my waiter.... for something I've had multiple times, I know how it should taste. So why argue with me? Just take a back and let it go. On top of arriving here at 8:45 and being seated at 9:20, it is now 10:07 and my food has yet to arrive!!!! 

Let's move forward to it now being 10:23 and my food finally arrived...
Llet's talk about when my fried rice arrived and it was extremely SALTY! And when I say salty, I mean it literally only tasted like salt on rice  so I had that sent back and they were kind enough to remake it for me.. BUT when I received my ramen, it was just bitter. I assume they just decided not to put any salt on any of my food after sending the rice back. Like I said, I come here so often that I know how my food should taste because I ALWAYS ORDER THE SAME EXACT THING!!!! 

Surely enough, I ended up talking to a manager with my complaints and she was nice enough to ensure a better visit next time I come. Sadly, it was my best friends first time there and she was not impressed. I felt bad because I suggested this amazing place that never let's me down & is always great when I go, except for this one time!"	3	Bachi Burger	4
Way overpriced for value.  Yeah I agree the employees hate working here. Got a plastic bottle soda, and asked for ice. Nope. No ice. Not even a cup in sight.  Boy the profit margin must be huge here. No frills to the enth degree. No plates either. Cardboard boxes or foil. Two plain hot dogs and a coke $18.  Then i stood at the counter waiting to ask for relish. I was ignored until the next order came up. I got 3 small packages of relish. What? The small 6 in hot dog was was good but not THAT good.  Never coming back here for sure. Not worth the aggravation.	1	Haute Doggery	3
When I lived in the SW, this restaurant was within a walking distance from me. I loved eating there! Food was always excellent, good service & moderate prices. I was worried they might close soon, because this beautiful place was practically always empty, often I was the only customer there. Well, I moved from the area while they were still open. Sorry to hear they are closed now... :(( Probably, location was not very good for the business, kind of hidden from the view from Rainbow.	5	Nagoya Japanese Restaurant	3
This place is in my neighborhood, and I eat there frequently. Always love their sushi & service. Never had a problem with anything but music. I want to hear some authentic Japanese music, not modern pop or country. It's just my personal preference when I go to ethnic places.	5	Sushi On Tropicana	3.5
It's been a while since I went to the Buffet at Bellagio last time. I remember my first impression - fantastic! All together I went there 4 or 5 times and loved it every time. Don't understand why some people are not impressed - was it a bad day for the buffet or a personal bad day?	5	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
I used to go to Oishi Sushi frequently when I lived nearby. It's a very nice, cozy, somewhat upscale place with class and ambiance. Low noise  & dim lights make it great for dates. Best Red Dragon rolls in town (my personal favorite.)	5	Oyshi Sushi	3.5
What kind of service is that? When I walked in this place there were almost no customers, but I had to wait for 25 minutes for my simple order. When I finally got my sandwich, it was barely worm. I'm not going there again!	1	Farmer Boys	3.5
I wish I could eat at Mon Ami Gabi every day! I absolutely adore food, service and atmosphere there.	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
This little club is an oasis in the hustle and bustle of today's Vegas.  A seductive, high energy atmosphere with performers that place a high value on production and quality performance.  We found the drinks tasty and frankly rather affordable for the strip.  If you are looking for a cool 1920s vibe and welcoming atmosphere this is the place for you.	5	1923 Bourbon & Burlesque	3.5
"I had never really heard of this place before my initial visit. We came here during one of our Legendary Vegas trips. It was an extremely early dinner. Had to be because we had a long night of boozing ahead of us and let's face it. Nobody wants to throw up a $90 meal.

Del Frisco's is an amazing steak house that prides themselves on quality food and service that makes you feel like a king. We were a party of approximately 12. We had very polite and courteous waitress that I honestly wouldn't mind taking home to momma. She was amazing. Despite lame advances of my friend at the end of the dinner, she kept it professional. Aside from her, they had an army of servers. No joke. Our drinks were refilled constantly. Never were our cups half full.

The steak itself was amazing. I got the Prime Ribeye and it was cooked exactly how I like it. Slightly bloody, still twitching and spiced to perfection. The side dishes are family style. We ordered a hand full of them that covered everyone. I wasn't as impressed with the side as my friends were but they complimented the meal very well. As soon as the sides came out, the army of servers circled the table and attacked, literally...

""Sir, would you like some corn?""
""Sir, would you like some Potatoes Au Gratin?""""
""Sir, would you like some Asparagus?""
""Sir, would you like some Mac and Cheese?""

It was quite overwhelming, but in a good way. Great service. Definitely a spot I would recommend if you're looking for a pretty money steakhouse in LV."	4	Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House	4.5
"Where am I? 

I don't remember walking here?

I was barely functioning. 

Wait, what time is it? 

I look around. There was a good amount of people on the same boat as me. Drunk, lost and hungry. Are we inside the Mirage? I guess we are. Good, that's where our hotel is. My friends did the ordering. I put my head down for a bit. 

I woke up, had some fries and the best left over French toast of my life. Okay, someone carry me to the room please."	3	Carnegie	3
"this place is on the opposite side of the of the I-15, away from the strip. it's located right next to a Big Lots and a Lucky's supermarket. in an area where all the other asian establishments are in LV. Vegas chinatown you could say.

we've tried a few other pho places in the area, but for some reason we keep coming back to this one. it's your run of the mill pho place, nothing special. pretty much the pho joint that you'd find anywhere else.

the one major minus of this place is the fact that the pho takes FOREVERS to come out. usually when you order a bowl of pho anywhere else. it comes out right away. for some strange reason, it takes soooooooooo long for it to come out here. 

I mean come on.. 

1)  broth? pre-made. 
2) noodles? pre-made.
3) meat? all ready and chopped up.

what the hell is taking so long?? throw it all in a bowl, pour the broth and serve while it's still hot! no need to make us wait 20+ minutes. i'm still slightly drunk and hung over. i want my damn bowl of pho! what the hell are you guys doing back there, gambling!? well... viet people do love to gamble, and it is vegas..."	2	Pho So 1	3.5
"The only real asian food we eat when we're in Vegas is Pho. We decided to switch it up a little bit and do some Thai.

Driving down Spring Mtn this was the first establishment we passed by. Grand Opening w\/ 15% off your bill. SOLD. We pulled in. There was barely anyone inside which didn't deter us at all. The layout of the restaurant was really nice, clean and modern. 

We ordered a few dishes that included Tom Yum Soup, Panang Curry and Pad Thai. They all tasted great especially the Tom Yum Soup. Service was tip top and prices were fairly priced. I really hope they get more business."	4	Krung Siam Thai	3.5
"Clearly, I was inebriated beyond belief. This was right after a glorious adventure at XS. I had met a new delightful friend and we walked here, or better yet stumbled here. The usual Denny's. Nothing special. We ate.

Upon leaving, I hadn't realized it then but my phone accidently fell out of my pocket. Once I got back to my hotel room I noticed it was missing. Losing your phone in Vegas is pretty much losing touch with reality. In a fit of panic I called over and they were kind enough to hold onto it for me. 

Again, still inebriated. I thought it was just a hop, skip and jump from my hotel room so I decided to walk instead of taking a taxi. It's approximately 6am, crazy hot and I'm walking. As I continue to walk, I begin to realize that it is ALOT further than I thought. Urgh.... 

Finally got my phone back with a pleasant txt msg waiting for me. I can exhale.

Thanks to this Denny's for holding onto it! Saved my life."	3	Denny's	3
I went there on a Tue night and Encore was a dead town (compared to other casino) it was my first time in this new casino so i wanted to try their new resturants too. This place had a special for $38, it came with 1 appetizer (choice of Ceaser Salad, mac&cheese bites or tomato basil soup) Main (8oz fillet mignon or Cedar plank salmon) and desert-two big balls of donuts with chocolate and caramel. I got the Mac&cheese bites and the fillet mignon. all this for only 38 bucks!! the best deal i ever had, PLUS the food was AMAZING, the steak was cooked perfectly, rare + . Much better than any expensive steakhouse i've been. definatly must go if you go to Encore!!! I also had their cocktails (grape crush and some kind of fruit martini) which was also delicious!!	4	Society Cafe Encore	4
I was really craving for Chinese breakfast and would really want to find somewhere with soy milk and you tiao.  The only place I can find thru Yelp is Yi Mei.  However, 3.5 stars makes me skeptical if I should check out this place.  I was really lucky to give it a try! I love the you tiao wrapped in egg and the beef noodle is yummy too! Everything is great, thou service can be improved...	5	Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli	3.5
The best natto pasta I've had at a Japanese Italian restaurant. All dishes were made with great care and though.  Will be back again.	5	Trattoria Nakamura-Ya	4.5
Really good food. Try all the piroshki and desserts. I'm comings back again for more.	5	Cafe Mayakovsky	4.5
The best sushi I've had in this part of Vegas! The prices are comparable to any local sushi shop but they give you larger slices of fish. The interior is classy and good for a family or a date. The sushi names are more traditional and way more appetizing than other places who name their sushi "tastes like my ex girlfriend". I strongly suggest this place for sushi or hibachi.	5	Sushi-ko	3.5
Ahhh... who knew Guamanian food was a thing? I didn't until I hit this place up based upon a friend's recommendation. We got both of their combo plate things, some spam wrap, and a latiya dessert to top it all off. How have you been keeping this delicious secret from the rest of the world for so long, Guam?!? Well I'm busting this thing wide open and sending everyone your way. Now if I can get someone to bring one to Seattle...	5	Red Rice	4.5
I enjoyed my meal at Stack. It has beautiful decor and the food was tasty. I was very impressed by the service. Maybe a tad over priced. It was also VERY loud in there.	4	Stack Restaurant & Bar	4

"We're regulars at Sam Woo in San Diego for its excellent food - never mind the customer service, but this place doesn't even compare.  The food was average at best, and they rip you off a few dollars more by calculating 15% tip on the total bill.  Yes, they add their 15% after calculating the bill and tax.  This is pure greed.  My wife told them that tips could not be calculated on the tax portion and that this is illegal and they recalculated it properly down by a few dollars.  [The larger Capital restaurant above it also has excellent food and didn't force tip on the bill like they did.]

We won't come back to this place again."	1	Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant	2
We absolutely LOVE Mcmullan's.  They have huge portions and unique items.. Our favorite is the nachos!! they are made with their house-made potato chips even the mini portion is huge!	5	McMullan's Irish Pub	4

I'm a regular there and it is always amazing !  Had a really amazing experience the other day dining in w my best friend who was visiting Vegas.  The manager Don was a pleasure and the food was spot on.  My friend is a very picky eater and she loved everything.  The portions are huge the staff is friendly! 6 stars!	5	Black Bear Diner	4
Less than one star.   Takes forever to be seated.  Server comes to me and asks what I want? In a harsh demanding way.  Left took forever to get a water and didn't give me a menu.   Don't go here !   And they don't offer the promotions as other tgi Fridays.   Awful experience....	1	TGI Fridays	2.5
If I could do less than one star I would.  The portions are small and the food had very little flavor and the veggies in the Mongolian chicken were raw.	1	Krung Thai Restaurant	4
This place is a great little gem of Las Vegas! Came in from Orange County for some work and gave this place a shot, glad I did. Friendly staff, neat atmosphere, and great sauces. Will be back again!	5	Jessie Rae's BBQ	4.5

All the yelp, trip adviser and various social media stickers on the door made me feel like I was going to enjoy an amazing breakfast and that was not what I got!  The restaurant is located in a strip mall location and looks like a good find when you search for it.  There was a long line for a wait and the locals told me I would not be disappointed when I questioned the 20 min wait before a flight so I stayed with my friends who are locals.  The wait wasn't too long ..our server took a bit of time getting to us because they were busy ...my fresh cup of coffee (there's a portion on the menu that says that we all deserve it to be fresh) was never refilled ...after I asked for it it came as I was almost done with my meal.  My gauge of a good breakfast is always a Benedict ...I've had multiple variations of it and it's my go to ...must be the sauce ....the menu talked about how you should get turkey if you want it but I guess it only applies to sausage and not bacon ..no beef or pork for me.  I opted for the Benedict with spinach ..egg was ok ..I asked for over medium and it came out over easy ..don't like it when the egg white is still liquid ...the hollandaise was average - nothing extra added to it and the spinach fairly bland.  I did order the bread in a tin and that was decent - I got to sample the plain, raisin and finally red velvet - the cook on each was different and I did finish the bread the only part of my meal that I polished along with the coffee.  I'm pretty limited in some of the things I can eat so when there's an item on the menu that excites me and its executed well I am pleased.  Social media is definitely something this restaurant does well and I think it contributes to their awards and recognition because the food is ok just like any other standard breakfast place out there.	3	Jamms Restaurant	4.5
Having grown up in a former British colony there are two things I crave ...fish and chips and shepherds pie and Gordon Ramsey's didn't disappoint!  The shepherds pie which I haven't been able to enjoy in a few years was a bit different from what I remember from my you th but the flavors of my childhood certainly came through and the portion size was just right.  The fish was perfectly cooked ...I like a bit of seasoning in my batter but the fish was perfectly executed and I enjoyed the tartar sauce that was served with it but again needed just a bit more seasoning.  We tried so many things on the menu from the delicious truffle fries to the lobster and shrimp rolls and the expertly crafted drinks.  The service was great - our server attentive, knowledgeable but the table set up was a bit odd.  I don't like feeling like I'm sitting in a walkway and our table was directly towards the back of the host stand and we saw everyone that walked by, also we had some fun benches where people patiently waiting got to stare at us eat so that would be my one and only criticism of how the restaurant is laid out.  Mr.Ramsey and his reputation are definitely elevated by this particular location.	4	Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill	3.5
Every time I come to Vegas I am taken here by two of my really god friends and I must say this location has not disappointed us yet!  The decor is very modern and inviting, the service is spot on, the food delicious and finally the mimosas are really yummy and they don't hold back on the champagne.  On our last visit we enjoyed the assorted pastry basket and I ordered the chiliquiles sp?  I think that is going to be my go to from now on ...chicken, a great sauce, cheese, eggs ..the only other thing I'd add would be rice since I like to add things!  The last time I went I had the salmon Benedict and enjoyed that as well ...one of the things that stood out to me was how friendly everyone was and how the staff remembered a lot of their guests ...definitely going to keep going when I visit!	5	DW Bistro	4.5
So the food here was pretty good - we ordered lamb, chili chicken, beef, veg, honey walnut shrimp, cashew chicken ...all ordered steamed rice but of course two of us got no rice despite walking out of the dining area to ask for it from the servers!  Understandably it can be family style but when a table asks for individual sides of rice perhaps you should do them the courtesy of delivering it!  I like to eat well and usually that guest service is rewarded however this is a place I won't go back to!	1	Red 8	3.5
One of my favorite restaurants in vegas! Everytime i come to vegas I always stop by and the food never disappoints! My favorite is the chicken pad thai, if you are looking for some yummy thai food i highly recommend lemongrass!!	5	Lemongrass	3.5
The food was good, but not the quality we've come to expect in high-end steakhouses. The table location was disappointing - far too close to the busy bar area. Service was OK, but again not as good as expected. Overall, far from meeting our expectations for a $450 meal.	2	Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak	4
Omg this place was delicious! Had the munchies and the pepperoni pizza was tasty. I would def be coming back here again when I just this hotel. The service was fast and friendly. There's plenty of places to sit and eat when you order here.	5	Sirrico's Pizza	3.5
Came her with the boyfriend on our last day for my birthday celebration. I had the lunch special combo plate. Chicken taco and chicken enchilada. Is was super yummy. The chips and salsa was delicious. I believe my waiter was Ray and he was very nice and attentive. He was so sweet and surprised me with ice cream for my birthday. That made everything perfect.	4	Gonzalez Y Gonzalez Restaurant	3.5
I'm giving 2 stars based on the service only. Service was good. There was no line so we got in right away. The food was ok. I felt fine up until 20 min after we ate I had the poops bad. My stomach hurt so bad I had chills and ran to the bathroom 3 different times. It wasn't fun. So I will not come back.	2	The Buffet at Monte Carlo	2.5
"Needed an inexpensive but decent place to stay for the weekend of EDC.

Our hotel room was simple and clean. The large living\/dining room was spacious with just enough furniture for two. The furniture was somewhat scratchy and outdated though but I wasn't expecting much. The bedroom was big enough for a queen sized bed and a TV, although the mattress did not fit the bed frame very well. Sheets were clean, no bed bugs. Bathroom\/bathtub all clean, no mold or cracks. The entire time we kept the AC at a 60 because temps were around 120 the entire time we were there. Basic wifi is free for up to 3 devices. If you want faster internet, its about $10 per day per device.

Service was fine. Everyone we encountered was friendly. We ate at the restaurants located inside the casino. They're cheap but the food was good enough to satisfy your hunger. Plus there are great Mexican places nearby to eat at. Location wise, this worked pretty well because it was away from the strip (wanted to avoid it during this trip) but super close getting to the venue for EDC. Security patrols the entire lot for most of the day because the casino's open 24hrs. The 2 ice machines near building 6 & 8 were not working at all times so there was no ice during the hottest times of the day (or for most of the days)."	3	Arizona Charlie's Boulder	2.5
Cheese was bad and had a funny smell. I had taken 3 bites of the food when I noticed the sour taste. Had our waitress take the food back and the female owner still charged me because I ate some of it. After arguing with her about the fact I didn't eat the meal the male owner started taking pictures of us and followed us outside to our car and continued to take pictures of our license plate and harassing us in the parking lot. Worst customer service I have ever had.	1	Griddlecakes	3
"Went here last night for my anniversary dinner, steak was delicious. Service was great, very friendly staff.

Meal:
Complimentary bread
Complimentary popovers- very yummy! 
Shrimp cocktail- my weakness! Delicious! 
Deviled eggs- don't even bother, these were the ""chef's special,"" bland and had powdered bacon...
Filet 10oz and asparagus - Perfect! Also got a side of chimichurri sauce 
Kobe Filet with green beans - Melts in your mouth! Oh my goodness my husband was in love. He also got the peppercorn sauce with added some heat flavor. 

Some other things to note:
No bathroom in restaurant, need to go out onto casino floor
Limited beer selection
A la crate style menu"	4	BLT Steak	4
Exceptional service by the one and only Jose S. He catered to our table and made our experience phenomenal. Best server\/service I've had in Vegas so far! Food was great, Frangria was amazing.	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
I happened to find this place on its opening night in Vegas. The staff are exceptionally friendly, from the host at the front door to the bartender and other waitstaff. Felt right at home for this Mississippi-born girl. I ordered a bowl of the gumbo and was greeted by a wide bowl with two perfect mounds of rice surrounded by delicious sausage and shrimp gumbo. Spicy, but not too much for me. I also had a Delta Sunset margarita, which has a bit of a raspberry taste. Tasty! The drink is mixed right in front of you if you sit at the bar. There's great decor from old license plates, film stills from the movie Forrest Gump, and other reminders of Southern culture. Also, a gift shop on the lower level with elevator access to the restaurant for those who cannot walk up the stairs. Smiles all around!	5	Bubba Gump Shrimp	3.5
We love this place & eat here at least twice a week! Yummy!	5	Chipotle Mexican Grill	3
Best pizza delivery with fresh ingredients!  Have it delivered as restaurant is very basic.	4	Sofia's Pizza	2.5
"Stopped by here for a quick lunch break with my cousins during our stay at the hotel.  The food was delicious; i ordered the bbq wings, and a large mug of ice cold shock top. I also tried the French fries and onion rings that my cousins ordered. Both were cooked to perfection.

However, good service is also a huge factor when going out to eat. And our waitress was super lacking in that regard. A young blonde girl, she seemed chill at first. But I'm not sure if it's because we were a large party of 11, but we caught her rolling her eyes when e asked if it was possible to split the check before ordering. And anytime we'd ask for something she'd make an exasperated face. She's lucky gratuity was already added or else we wouldn't have left her much of a tip, if any at all. I might be able to sympathize if she was having an off day, but if customers are being polite in their requests, there's no need to take it out on them.

All that said, I'd be willing to try this place again. Except next time I'll sit at the bar."	3	TAP Sports Bar	3.5
"Backstory is that my family and I went to the Rio get the buffet and the line was too long.  We walked around and decided to go to Martorano's, mostly because there was no line.  The first thing I saw was a picture of the chef.  He looked like a cast member of the Jersey Shore, and I said to myself, ""this is gonna be a rip-off"".  Mr. Martorano, if you read this, please accept my humble apologies.  Do not judge a book by its cover.  This was easily the best Italian food I've ever had in my life.  

I decided to go with the fixed price 3 course menu, as did 3 others in the group.  I went with the Calamari for the first course, Meatball and Spaghetti for the second, and the canoli was the only desert choice.  This was $45 and after eating the food, it was evidently a very reasonable price.  

The first delivery to the table was the bread.  It came with three dipping sauces.  There was olive oil, butter, and chili oil dipping thing.  Ignore the butter, ignore the chili, just dip in olive oil.  I lived in the Mediterranean, in the heart of olive country, and the oil that was served plain was the best Olive Oil I've ever had.  Light as a feather but not lacking in a deep earthy tones that hit and then gracefully fade away with perfection.  The olive oil alone justifies returning.  

The first course I had was the Calamari.  I read some of the reviews on Yelp and decided to get the sauce on the side.  This was a good move, and the dish was very very good.  The Calamari was well cooked and the dipping sauce has robust chunks of roasted peppers.  It had enough kick without being overpowering.  It was a great choice for sharing as well.  I had plenty of people at the table who had no interest in Calamari, but still used the sauce for bread dipping.  I tried the Ceasar and the Shrimp Scampi starters and both were excellent, but I found the Calamari to be the best of the three.  

The main course was the famous Meatball with spaghetti.  The most surprising aspect of this dish, and most of the dishes honestly was how light they were.  The pasta was light and not overly filling.  The meatball was dense enough to have bite, but none of the dishes weighed me down or had me dragging later.  My dad had the eggplant, and that was the only dish that could rival the meatball.  Two other diners at the table had the Chicken Alfredo, which was good, but I enjoyed the meatball more, and honestly the eggplant over shadowed every dish on the table.  

The meal ended with a perfectly done Canoli.  The ricotta filling was denser than I was used to, but again still very light.  It was not too sweet.  A fine ending to a magnificent experience.  This was easily the best Italian food I have ever had.  It's also quite possibly the best meal I've ever had in the United States.  

The service was also very very good.  The server (Yuri?) was attentive and informative.  He was professional without being stuffy.  It was just the right wavelength given the calibre of the food being served, and the atmosphere of the restaurant.  This is not a stuffy place, or a place for small kids.  It has a vibe that can accommodate someone in a three piece suit, or jeans and a track jacket.  

This meal will most likely be the highlight of my entire Las Vegas trip, and I would not be surprised if the rest of my family felt the same way.  You will not be disappointed."	5	Martorano's	3.5
Awesome Buffett!! We walked in with a party of 15. It wasn't too long of a wait considering it was a busy saturday night. An extensive food selection. For the price we paid it was definetly worth the food. The staff was amazing especially our server Jie!! We will be back!	5	Bacchanal Buffet	4
I had the tuna nachos as an appetizer, and they were delicious and very light, perfect way to start the meal. There is also complimentary bread offered at the beginning of the meal. One with jalapeño, another with raisins, and a 3rd that's muffin like (not sure of the flavor). I wasn't a huge fan. I tried the grilled  mahi mahi as well with mole sauce and it was delicious, if anything I wish there would have been a little bit more of the sauce, I ran out way before I finished my fish. I tried the grilled chicken and it was really good as well. For drinks we ordered the cactus pear Margarita, and the white peach Margarita, hands down go for the white peach Margarita on the rocks. You will not be disappointed. As for dessert, we ordered the lemon tart, it was meh, too sweet. Next time I'll probably pass on the dessert.	5	Mesa Grill	4
Great tasting seafood dishes.  There a lot of interesting choices so you'll want to visit more than once.  Excellent service by a really cute and friendly waitress.  Restrooms were very clean as was the restaurant throughout. Try this little gem for something different and tasty. My only complaint was that my Arroz de Marisco dish could have used more squid and was mostly rice.  Other than that; you must try their ceviches-they are really good!	4	El Toque Del Sabor	4.5
Went to Memphis and placed an order at the drive thru.  The total came to a lot more than the prices on the menu, so I asked what was up.  Turns out they charge dinner prices if you order at the drive thru, even during lunch hours.  That's insane!  Had Hawaiian BBQ across the street instead.	1	Memphis Championship Barbecue	3
"by itself, i give 4 stars, but compared to other options nearby, in regards to portion and pricing, id drop it down to 3 stars.

ordered a large pizza that was half greek roulette \/ half wild card.  the greek half was full of flavors that blended well together, and the wild card half was definitely above and beyond your average pepperoni pie in terms of taste.  I'm not usually a fan of thin crust, or pizza cut into squares for that matter, but this was baked just right and overall a good pizza.

again, my issue is with portion and price.  i have no problem dropping $30 on a pie from Joes, but i walk out with a 19 inch pizza that won't even fit in my fridge.  the 16 inch large pizza from HighRoller was a bit underwhelming (for the price).  that 3 inches may not seem like much, but its actually a huge difference.

*Using the surface area equation: A=Pi x R2
16 inch pizza   3.14x 8 x 8 =200.96 
19 inch pizza   3.14 x 9.5 x 9.5 =283.38 

i also ordered a philly sub.  hands down delicious.  grass fed beef has a gamey flavor that was complimented by the mushrooms and peppers.  also mozzarella was a surprisingly good choice to round it out (although there could have been more of it).  again, delicious.  but we come back to portion and pricing.  if a Capriottis sub had a premature baby... the subs here would be it.

i purchased the yelp deal that was worth $40, and in return i got a 16 inch pizza, a sub, and a 20oz soda.  not sure the value is there.  i realize the cost of organic\/free range\/non processed ingredients drive up the price, but it seems a bit too much (or maybe I'm just cheap).

company should consider providing a bit more info on the ingredients that demand these prices.  people who seek out healthy food alternatives want more than just an organic or free range stamp (like what state the veggies are grown in, or what farm the animals are from).  ""High Roller Pizza carefully handpicks and scrutinizes every single one of their ingredients"" yet offers very little detailed information to the customer.

all that being said, ill certainly be back.  its right down the street from me, and a great alternative to the chain pizza joints."	4	High Roller Pizzeria	3.5
We all know how wonderful the food is at eggslut but today I want to commend one of their staff for going above and beyond. Marlon, you are a rockstar!! Thanks man!! Greatly appreciated.	5	Eggslut	4
"AH-MAZING!!!!  Was here for my bff's wedding and she had the ceremony and reception there.  Loved every single minute of it!

Service - they bend over backwards to help you with anything
Food - Top notch stuff - highlights was the mushroom puff pastry appetizer, cheese puff, beurre blanc sauce, steak with carmelized onion..

Def. give this a chance, you won't be disappointed."	5	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
Not good at all!!!!  It's beautiful, but don't be fooled by that.  Nothing was that good there, it was edible, but nothing great.	2	Beijing Noodle No. 9	2.5
"Had a welcome dinner here with drinks and heavy appetizers.  Delish food!!!!
Mini sliders were tasty, quesidillas were very very good, cinnamon donut was simple yet satisfying for your sweet tooth.  Would definately recommend for American food."	4	First Food & Bar	3.5
Got the chirizo hash - ehh, just OK.  Split that, but I ordered biscuit and gravy which was pretty tasty and large on it's own.	3	Hash House A Go Go	4
"YUMMY!!!  This was my first visit to the reknown buffet.  The crab legs weren't the biggest, however, they were full of flavor!  I got two plate fulls, it was so good.  Also, the other hot food was good, they had a good selection of Asian (Japanese and Chinese).  I loved the fact that they had salmon sashimi, I swear my bf and I ate about 20 pieces.

Then, when we did move over to dessert, there were way too many to choose.  During this past trip, we went to Paris and Luxor's buffet too, but the Rio's dessert bar was simply the best.  Creme brulee was cooked perfectly, good selection of gelato, and other great tarts\/cakes.  I want to go back!!!!!"	4	Village Seafood Buffet	3.5
"For $21\/pp for lunch, here's some highlights
- awesome pork tacos
- pork belly sandwiches
- sushi  
- truffle potato au gratin
- prime rib
- kalbi 
- gelato 
- panna cotta

And of course it's in the hottest hotel on the strip!"	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
Firstly, the Office 5 never pretended to be anything other than a neighborhood bar. I think that without fail the owners and staff were friendly and accommodating to everyone who came in regardless of whether they were Dinosaurs or hookers. The neighbors enjoyed meeting there and talking about our homes in the adjoining area.  Maybe it was dark and dingy as one reviewer said, but so what? We didn't go there thinking it was Studio 54.  I will miss the great characters and the warm and generous owners. It is such a shame...	5	Office 5 Bar & Grill	3.5
Great food and friendly service.  The Eastern location is difficult to get in and out of especially in rush hour traffic.  But, well worth it!	4	Greens and Proteins	4
This is the Las Vegas hidden gem of Thai Food.  I had the Chilean Bass Drunken Noodles which was cooked perfectly and seasoned beautifully. When you come you must order off the Northern Thai part off the menu and\/or Chef's choice because that is their speciality. The garlic prawns my sister-law order were incredible and piled a mile high we had to take the rest home. My brother had the crispy duck khao soi and this is the second time he's ordered it. He basicly licked his plate clean. My brother was just promoted to Captain and this was the perfect place to celebrate his achievement!	5	Lotus of Siam	4
"Please hire some adults to prepare the food, absolutely disgusting!!! It's a shame that you make people pay to eat that garbage! Pizza wasn't fresh, even your own employees pick over the chicken and day old rice!!! No one works the exit, so there is no security bracelet and\/or stamp to identify which kids belong with what adults??Absurd!  I guess you won't see an issue until a kid goes missing or people complain of food poisoning! 

I will NOT be back!"	1	John's Incredible Pizza Company	3
Fantastic place! Went there because of a groupon, but will definitely be back in the future. The food was great, the restaurant very clean, and the owner who seems to wear every hat there, was extremely friendly. Fish and chips were great. I don't usually ever like coleslaw, but I was shocked at how good it was. Finished the meal with the the deep fried raspberry cheesecake which was beyond yummy. Can't wait for the next visit. Already planning on those fish tacos next. :)	5	Off the Hook	4.5
Great meal, every dish was better than the last. Lives up to all expectations. Expensive but that should not come as a surprise to anyone who has dined at any of the other locations.	5	Nobu	4
"I see a lot of favorable reviews here, which is good...perhaps they were just having a rough night tonight.  However, you'd think on a Saturday night, they'd have their A game on.  I have to start by saying this is a beautiful restaurant from a decor perspective. Gorgeous inside. 

As for the food, it's just okay. A third of the chips in our basket were stale. Kind of disturbing to find those little hidden gems when you're trying to enjoy your salsa. I will say the salsa is quite tasty however. We tried the queso and ordered it without onions. Of course, it came full of onions. We sent it back. We ordered the street tacos, again without onions, and of course they came with onions. Might be a small thing, but you'd think if someone takes time to order food without something, as a server, you'd check to make sure it was right. Nope. 

The chicken was oily and dripped out of the taco. The carnitas have decent flavor, but there's a lot of cinnamon in their making so be ready for that.  I've been eating Mexican food in Las Vegas for 30 years, and I've seen a lot of places come and go. I hope Matador makes it as its a really cool place, but they need to take a step back and focus on the food. It's what will keep people coming back for years to come. I feel like they are trying to hard to pack as many flavors into the food all at once. 

Just focus on making all of your menu items classic and tasty and the rest will take care of itself."	3	Casa Del Matador	3.5
We've been waiting for Bobby to reopen his restaurant since they closed. I'm glad they are open again and we can enjoy some of the finest Mexican food in Vegas!  They've only been open a week and you can tell they're working a few links out, but for the most part, they are back up to speed with the old place. I highly recommend you check this place out if you are looking for honest, straightforward Mexican cuisine with fresh ingredients!	4	Viva Mercado's Mexican Bar & Grill	4
Good place. Good potential. Still shaking off the opening jitters. Wait staff could use some bussers to focus on the customers but the food and drinks are good. Can't wait to come back when they've had time to settle in!	4	Public School 702	3.5
Daniel, the general manager, is such a delightful person. He was extremely patient and helpful with explaining and recommending options on the menu. It was my first time at Greens & Proteins, and the food is fantastic. I ordered the green shake and a BBQ chicken pizza (square) - super thin crust and vegan cheese. I highly recommend this place. I wish there was a location in Irvine or Los Angeles, CA. I highly recommend this place	5	Greens and Proteins	4
Worst experience. Stale food was served after heating up with sweeteners. I've been to tens of Indian restaurants. This offered the worst food. If you wish you go still, I hope you get fresh food.	1	Gandhi India's Cuisine	3.5
We hadn't planned on coming here whilst in Vegas however whilst exploring the sleezy side (Downtown) the choice of dinner options were fairly limited if you wanted a nice venue... However we found this place and it was amazing, food options were nicely paired and it's a bit like tapas where it's more about sharing than choosing your own dishes! Everything was very reasonable priced and far cheaper than any main strip restaurant and I highly recommend it!	5	Carson Kitchen	4.5
Literally the BEST pizza in town. Service is amazing, pizza is awesome!!! Pepperoni and sausage is the best!!!	5	Broadway Pizzeria	4
Best fish n' chips EVER!!!! Get the Gordon's favorite beer along with the fish chip combo!! Along with the combo, you can get 2 dipping sauce! Get the siracha sauce and tar tar sauce!! The fries is damnn!! There is an option for different flavor fries for $2 more!! Also tried the chicken but not as good as the fish!! Would come back just for the fish!! Yummmmmmm	5	Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips	4
I'm not a fan of most buffets due to the lack of cleanliness and quality of food.  However, the buffets in Las Vegas are just on another level.  I've been to a few buffets in LV over the last few years but so far this place has been the cleanest with the best visuals.  They also have a wide variety of food and desserts as well as freshly made juices.  It's definitely worth a visit.	4	Wicked Spoon	3.5
this joint is way too pricey! $11 for 2 items! and side of veggie $8..?!? would have been okay if they give good amount\/portions of food. They're employee has no personality at all..!! - so not worth of my visit.!!	1	Pan Asian Express	1.5
This is the best bar in Vegas hands down. You can get anything your mind could come up with improved by these bartenders. After a couple drinks I just allowed them to make me something cool. I was never let down. Amazing place.	5	Herbs & Rye	4
Just ate at Origin India on Paradise Rd. the food was fresh and not greasy. The staff was very friendly and it was very homey inside. We has the lunch buffet and being vegetarian and gluten free, there was plenty to eat. Highly recommend it if you want a nice, friendly Indian restaurant.	5	Origin India Las Vegas	3.5
"Bad Service!!!!
We were asking for 4 schnitzel (milanesa) baguettes ,one of the schnitzel baguette we ask without spicy in it , and one of the other schnitzel baguette we ask to remove the vegetables that supposed to come with it and serve it separate in a plastic container or something .

We wore asking for 2 chicken thigh baguettes , 
And chicken nuggets for the kids..

We were asking for ketchup mayonnaise and mustard and also to add some side salads and we will pay for it occurs .

The representative on the line  Took all the  orders and said that the delivery would cost $20.

We agreed  and double confirm the order when the delivery guy arrive to the MGM Hotel he gave us the bags with the food inside and left..
I took the order upstairs to the room and was surprised to find out that there is no ketchup no mayonnaise no mustard no salads no vegetables that was supposed to be separated from the schnitzel  baguette.
We called again in order to receive the rest of the order but instead of getting it we were surprised to find out that one of the owners I believe was talking to us in a very rude way saying: 
""if you want the ketchup mayonnaise and mustard you need to pay another $20 for the delivery that they forgot to put in, and regarding the baguette with the vegetables that supposed to be separated he said that there is no vegetables (salad) supposed to be added to it...""

It's so nervous that you're trying to keep kosher and the options are limited and you finding that people like them taking advantage on those people...

I know for sure that Genesis is out of the question of where we going to eat at....
The food was average
The fries was wet, nothing was hot actually not even warm.. One of the begets that we asked not to have spicy came with spicy...

Strongly not recommended!!!!!

P.s
One of the workers said that the owner doesn't really care about the yelp page."	1	Genesis Restaurant	3.5
Great sushi.  The staff is always super friendly and fast. It's defiantly worth a try. The Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna is amazing as well other unique rolls. They also have a great selection of non-sushi items.	5	Sushi Bomb	4
My usual place was closed so I had remembered this place, went here one other time and it was just ok only to return again to have an even worse experience. I ordered 2 cheese slices well done, crispy to go. I had a seat, received a phone call and waited over 10 minutes to be handed a box where I was sitting, I decided to open it and start eating, I was starving. I never in my life ate pizza where no oil ever dripped out the back when lifting it to my mouth or cheese stretching when taking a bite, the pizza was cold, dry, hard, not crispy but stale, stiff and thinner than the box it came in, I was shocked being I waited over 10 minutes for this order, it was obviously old and sitting there a while. Had I not been busy on the phone and starving I would have thrown it right back at them and walked out, are you kidding me? This is a good way to go out of business if thats what you are after. There were more than enough people working behind the counter, it was like a party back there, the date was 7\/10\/2017 at 4:45\/5 pm if this helps the owner.	1	Red Rock Pizza	3.5
Let's just start by saying I'm in such a wow! From food, to service, to the environment. My husband and I were here in Las Vegas for 2 months continuing to build our vacation home. On New Years Eve we sat at the bar (first time there, friend recommended) and this beautiful young woman approached us(I believe her name was Janna). She was very attentive, answered all of our questions, and even suggested a red wine that would compliment what we were having for dinner. We returned last night 1\/9 and I was so happy to see her again! She remembered what we had from appetizers down to the wine! She is such a great spirit, we hope to see her more and more when we visit from L.A! If you haven't tried Echo & Rig yet...you are strange!!	5	Echo & Rig	4.5
Ayce Korean BBQ and sushi. Hooray! The food was good and the service was good. It was only hard to convey a shell fish allergy so we had to keep double checking on if the crab was imitation crab or real crab. Everything was tasty especially the mushroom poppers. Yums.	4	Biwon Korean BBQ & Sushi Restaurant	4
The presentation of the establishment is nice, even if no thought about the environmental impact is taken into account with the 24 hours a day flames. The fries tasted stale, and the burger meat was a bit on the dry side.	3	Gordon Ramsay Burger	4
"One of the best ramen restaurants in las vegas! They are always nice to customers. Not only they serve ramen, but also have a Japanese rice bowl which is miso cha-shu bowl. The cha-shu is greatest I ever had before. I  can recommend you to order shiro miso with cha-shu if you go there first time ;) you will enjoy it!

店員さんはとても感じがよく、ご飯もとても美味しかったです。大人数も対応していて友達とみんなできても楽しく過ごすことが出来ました。また食後に小さいシャーベットが無料で出て嬉しいサービスでした。お店に来るたびに少しずつ雰囲気が変わっていてその変化を見るのも楽しみの1つです^_^"	5	Go!ku	4
"There is not even one item on the buffet that is exceptional and I would go back for it.

One item I was searching in the Buffett was barbecued pulled pork. Which I never found. There wasnt even the old fashioned Ice cream on the Buffett, instead there were sorbet and gelato... 

Definitely not worth $60 or waiting 150mins... 

$50 burger at Ramsay's restaurant would have been more classy and pleasant..."	2	Bacchanal Buffet	4
We were so excited to eat here, and we were not disappointed at all. What an amazing dining experience! The staff was so attentive and very well informed. Our waiter answered every question we had, and made sure our meal was perfect. And it really was perfect! From the salad with green goddess dressing, which was cold and fresh and crisp to the breads, and that was before the main course! We had the beef Wellington, which was absolutely heavenly. The potato purée was silky and flavorful, the mushrooms were earthy and savory. Truly sublime. And then came the dessert! The sticky toffee pudding was so good, served with ice cream. Even the coffee was fabulous! Honestly the best meal I've ever had in my life! It's been two days and we're still rhapsodizing over it. Do not miss this restaurant if you're in Las Vegas! It is truly amazing.	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
Been here 2x now the first with the wife and second with friends we traveled to vegas with. Each time we had different burgers and the different variety of fries. The food was spectacular as was the service. I've enjoyed Gordon's tv shows over the years but after eating here it's obvious he's the real deal. Foods pricey but worth it	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
Amazing food. Great take on southwest food. The tiger shrimp tamale appetizer was excellent. We also had the green chili burger and Chicken skewer both of which were really good. Topped off with signature margaritas and excellent service. This made for a fantastic lunch.  Highly recommended!	5	Mesa Grill	4
The quiche lorraine was excellent.  I don't like quiche, but tried my husband's to keep an open mind.  And it was delicious.  The eggs were very fluffy almost like they were whipped.  Also, the owner (Olivier)  was very welcoming and friendly.  We will definitely go back.  C'etait super !	5	Baguette Cafe	4.5
"BEST ramen noodles in Las Vegas. Try the vegetable ramen that comes with a really tasty broth. I've eaten at a lot of different Asian restaurants and was surprised by how good the noodles were. By far, better than any Pho place in town. 

It is located in a cute and intimate restaurant with lots of parking. It has a nice and warm feel to the restaurant compared most chain restaurants. 

The only place that I have seen Lychee Sherbet served for dessert. 

Definitely recommend any of their noodle bowls. Delicious!"	5	Blue Sea Sushi and Izakaya	4
I really like this place and go often. The staff is really  friendly every time I go. But, the last two times I've eaten there, I've found hair in my food. One time in my omelet eight months ago and again today in my french toast. The manger and staff were quick to remove it from the bill and apologize, but I'm not looking for three times a hair here. Good food, but hold the hair. Seriously.	3	The Original Sunrise Cafe	4.5
"What can I say? At least I tried it.  We even tipped the staff BEFORE the bad experience began.   Saw a post from a friend about the place so we were excited to try it.  First issue was with the staff with a bad attitude\/bad service.  She didn't even say hello and seemed annoyed like she didn't want to be working.  Second issue was with the staff completely forgeting our order.  And it wasn't even busy.  We had to ask the cook (rude staff person was no help).  He did his best to rush the order.   Finally issue was that they completely forgot the juice that we ordered.  We almost had to get out our receipt to prove we ordered a juice, which was disappointing.    

It was $30 for two people and one juice, which is a little high for ok food and bad service.  Definitely a bad experience.  

On a good note, the place seemed clean and in order.  It seems like a good concept,  we just didn't fit in with the ""meathead\/gym culture"" which seems to be the tone of the place.    Also if you are not wearing gym clothes, enter at your own risk.  Weird place."	1	Protein House	4
Before going to this restaurant, I read the yelp reviews that were pretty spot on. Yes, the location was hard to find. So thank you for the heads up. So for the good.  The best part for me was the ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant itself. It was like being on the strip without being in a casino. It's really cool.  The only thing is that it has the snooty Summerlin vibe to it.  As for the food, the only stand out items to me were the wine and cheese. Everything else on the menu was pretty standard including their "specials" that are existing items on their menus.  For the bad. Well you guessed it, the SERVICE.  From the hostess to server. And we spent over $500 for dinner?!  In fairness, we went on a Friday night.  Then again, if you're going to charge $33 for a pork chop, then step up. Our waiter actually snapped at us when we asked him if we could order dinner. And this was after we had patiently waited for 30 minutes. Really? Even the staff have snooty attitudes?  So in conclusion, it wasn't the best or worst. I'd be willing to go again if I was forced (like a group dinner). But didn't make my "can't wait to go again list	3	Vintner Grill	4
This place is delicious. Overall, the food was great and the owner and staff were friendly. Try the Cripsy Beef that is listed under the Chef's Specilities. It's better than any meat dish and it's not even meat.	5	Veggie House	4.5
Very good place to visit. We didn't know they had a restaurant in Las Vegas. We got the pepperoni pan pizza and it tasted as good as the one located in Chicago. When we visit Vegas, we will definitely be going there again. Awesome pizza	5	Giordanos - Las Vegas	4
"Beautiful hotel, but average for the facilities. The bathroom doesn't have an air vent and the hotel does not provide any complimentary coffee makers. C'mon, even motels provide those.

Overall, the room was clean and the view was great. The beds are comfortable too."	3	MGM Grand Hotel	3
"Needs lot  of improvement. .. crispy spinach for too oily. Chicken satay were horrible. Peanut sauce was like water. Their meat in the curries was very tough. Their pricing is also not right. They are charging  $11 for main entree. It is much higher price than some of the best Thai places that charge $9.95 for the main entree and their food is much better than Brown Rice Thai.
Not going there again. I have crossed this off from my list."	2	Brown Rice Thai Kitchen	4
Everything we ordered was excellent. Don't miss their Shrimp cocktail.  Staff is friendly . The best mexican food in Las Vegas !	5	Frijoles & Frescas Grilled Tacos	4
"I came back and checked my receipt. They overcharged  on some of our dishes. Food was ok . Service sucked. Our server was not very attentive and would disappear everytime for long. 
Another overrated  restaurant  in downtown summerlin. Not going back again. The overcharging just put me off and also the service."	2	Grape Street Cafe & Wine Bar	3
Excellent thai food. We ordered chicken satay, fish cakes. Fish cakes could have been less oily though. We ordered chicken panang and mint meat for our entree. Excellent. Right quantity, right flavour. I could not find anything wrong in the dish. The owner Ken is a young humble guy and his restaurant  should do well with the good food, service and prices he is offering.	4	Kinthai	4.5
"This is new best Thai place in town... almost  perfect  in every sense. Family run business ... great atention has been paid to  menu, choosing the right cutlery and dishes. Very impressive. Nice decor too...
The food was excellent. We ordered the beef panang and chicken yellow curry. Excellent.  Meat was soft, cooked very well and curry flavor to die for. The rice was  extremely  moist which is what I liked the best.

If you get a chance say Hi to their pastry chef Gail. The coconut icecream is the best one I have had so far. 

I am definitely  going back to try their other dishes. A new jewel in the crown!"	5	Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert	4.5
Had a lot about this place so decided to give it a try. I would give 5 stars for the ambience and service but the food was just about average. If you are dining during regular hours and ordering a cocktail then I surely don't want to pay$ 10-$11 to have my cocktail in a plastic glass. I absolutely did not pay the full price for the drink for that. We ordered their lettuce cups and were disappointed .. the chicken was dry and smelled. We ordered their perch burger and vegetarian burger. The perch burger was ok .. the fried heirloom tomato in it was not a good idea. The vegetarian burger patty was over cooked and I think paying $ 15 for a vegetarian burger is a rip off. I can get 10 times better burger at better places at half the price . They are pay too overpriced otherwise.	3	Downtown Terrace	4
We recently visited Nora's with our friends. The experience and food was average. The hostess had a cold attitude. No smile,  didn't feel welcomed. They made us sit down and did not even lay the napkins and cutlery . We had to request for it once appetizers arrived. Main course was served all cold,  meat had no flavour . The worst part is that their service and food does not explain me why this restaurant menu items are priced on the higher side. To top it all they do not serve fresh grated parmesan once the meal is on the table.  Bummer! We were given stale geated parmesan cheese in a glass jar.	2	Nora's Italian Cuisine	4
"Even del taco  would taste better than this food. Our server was horrible. No common courtsey. Did not even refill my glass of water. He was only interested is offering high priced drinks.  
Del carbon chicken was dry and bland. I hate paying $20 for a dish when it is no way worth it. Mt guest ordered fajitas and he said the same thing. Even the salsa served as starter with chips was bad. 
This is a real bad food and for anyone who understand flavors and knows what good food is will agree.  
This restaurant is off my list. Not going there again."	2	Cantina Laredo	3.5
We tried the buffet. Expensive and insipid. Only their goat curry was good . Rest everything was absolutely tasteless. This is not how Indian food tastes. Never going back again.	1	Paradise India	4
"Visited this place after seeing people give it 4.5 stars. I would say it is just about average. The owner has paid attention to interiors but if it is supposed to be depict fine dining, bar and lounge then they need to do something more than just hanging the chandelier from the top. It is not a nice view when you look up because I have never been to a fine dining and lounge space that has undone ceiling. Looks very cheap.

Service was good. Food could have been better. Their raspberry ginger mojito was very good. Their pan seared scallops which they claim is one of their signature dishes was overcooked. The presentation although was very good. Their zucchini fries were average with no salt. 
Their spicy seafood pasta which again they claim is one of their signature dishes was average. Pasta was overcooked.  They had some mussels and tiny shrimps for the sake of calling it seafood pasta. Restaurants like this should not cut corners in preparing food like this. We didn' t like their cheap cheese grater. I have better ones at home.
Their creme brulee was a disaster. Looks like the chef made no efforts to serve it fresh. It had an overdose of vanilla essence. The caramelized sugar coating was cold, thick and extremely sweet. The caramelization part is supposed to be done just before serving.  Little did we know they serve it pre made. Very disappointing.  
We have been to some of the best food places all over the country. So when it comes to restaurants we pay attention to many details. The place failed to sparkle for us last night."	3	The Sparklings	4
"I was a big fan of Guy Fiery and his shows on food network until I visited his own restaurant . The only good thing  about it was that our server was nice and smiling. 
We ordered wings and they were dry and extremely salty. We ordered his original ringer hamburger and a vegetarian  burger. Not impressed at all. The bun was dry. The coleslaw in the burger overpowered the taste of the patty.   The fries as side were nothing great too. There was nothing about the food that could ever  make us go back to his restaurant. 
Considering he is from Vegas and runs such successful shows  on TV , his own food needs lot of work and improvement. Basic food like wings and burger...who gets it wrong? 
This place is way too overpriced for the dry tasteless food we got to eat last night. It is off our list."	2	Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar	3.5
This buffet should be shut down. Its a shame that red rock has introduced no changes at all in its buffet items. Its gone from bad to worse. The staff looks overworked and underpaid. No one smiles. It is like a zoo. Food tastes awful. Cutting corners to control expenses is fine but with Red Rpck needs to revisit its buffet items and the staff helping in that section.	1	Feast Buffet	3.5
We go here so very often and never been disappointed with the food and the service. Chicken satay , curry puff, clams,, curries and try anything on their menu and the flavor is always so rich and different. This is our favorite Thai food place. We never fail to order the mango stick rice .. that is to die for. One of their servers PIKON is amazing..She remembers us every time we walk in and even reminds us what we order normally. Very attentive always.	5	Weera Thai Restaurant	4
"They changed their menu very recently. They had such good food and selection last time we went. We just left the place after realizing  what they have done to the menu. Reminds me of a place like Gordon Biersch. .. The change is menu killed that place and they never recovered after that.

Not going to Umami again with their new menu choices. Why do companies do it ...?"	2	Umami Burger -  SLS Las Vegas	4
"It's a hole in the wall but the food is so good. Their Thai food scale is from 1 - 5 so just be careful when ordering. Their chicken satay was good.
 We loved their Kung Pao and Chicken Panang. Need to come back again to try their other dishes on the menu. 
I am all for supporting such restaurants that might not have a big name but they serve excellent food."	5	Sakina Thai Cuisine	4.5
"Short version: The food is absolutely nothing special. The high prices for what is, at best, Olive Garden quality fare is ridiculous. The food takes ages to arrive. Plus, you may still end up seated next to Vegas a-holes. The only upside is that the servers are friendly and attentive.

Long version: So my girlfriend, two female colleagues, and I were in Vegas for a conference. We're trying to figure out where to get dinner, and we finally end up at Bouchon. It's a celebrity-chef restaurant in The Venetian. The decor is impressive. The prices are high. The menu is written to get you excited about the food. We were expecting amazing things. The many people on the waitstaff were extremely friendly, so we were even more expectant. We asked that our food - entrees, apps, and sides - be served at the same time. It took 45 minutes for the meal to arrive. And it was so disappointing.

The onion soup and white sausage entree were good, nothing terrible, but for an affected, overpriced French ""bistro"" from a celebrity chef, I was expecting much better than Olive Garden level. Both my colleagues said their main dishes were pretty good but nothing to brag about. One of them also got a side order of $7 ""pomme frites."" They were plain, bland French fries. The fries at Smashburger put these to shame, for God's sake. My gf got the worst of it. The roasted squash was soggy on top and hard\/undercooked on the bottom, and bland all over. The fried zucchini blossoms were inedible oil-sponges. She literally didn't eat them. The salade de tomate was swimming in vinaigrette.

Then, to add insult to injury, a group of five arrogant dudes and one skank in their late 20s came in. Where do you think they got seated? As far away from all other human beings as possible? Nope. Right next to us. And I do mean ""right next."" There was hardly any space at all between their table and ours. Tip to the Bouchon hostesses: when a pack of a-hole guys comes in, don't seat them next to a table with three attractive women and one guy. I knew these guys were d-bags the second I saw them, and I was right. They kept staring over, and sure enough, as predicted, one of the scumbags couldn't resist making a loud, inappropriate comment directed at one of the women at our table. Naturally, this p-ssy never, ever would've done that if he had been there by himself, but surrounded by his fellow scum he was brave.

Nice going, Bouchon. We wait forever for overpriced, mediocre food and end up getting harassed by the sh-tbags you seated right up against our table."	1	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
"The one thing that stands out about Carnegie is the humongous, ungodly portions. Seriously, check out the photos others have posted here on Yelp. Everything is really at least two portions, sometimes three or four. If you're wise, when you're with another person, you'll order a single dish. You two can split it and probably still have leftovers (if you're in a room with a fridge). The prices are high, but when you realize that each dish is at least two full meals, it seems reasonable.

I had the tongue omelet. It was monstrous. Two omelets in one. Could not finish it even though it was delish. My gf had the BLT. This was probably four sandwiches in one. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it contained an entire pound of bacon. She didn't even come close to finishing it although she liked it.

Our server was super friendly while also moving nonstop and multitasking her a-- off. A man who looked a little like Humphrey Bogart was also speeding around. They contributed to the authentic NYC deli atmosphere, which was broken only by the blinking, chirping gambling devices just beyond the railing."	4	Carnegie	3
Very good food. Wanted to compare the urban station to them so me and my fiancé tried them yesterday and we was taking by them! They are so much better more reasonable and give you more for your monies worth! We order 2 pounds of shrimp, fried fish, rolls, and fried chicken and wasn't no more then $40! It was an awesome experience with friendly and fun staff! Place was packed but made sure to bring out food hot and in a timely matter. Will be back in a couple of days!	5	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
"The food was Great and the waiter was awesome sauce! But there was a mix up with my order and the cook didn't want to replace it. It was stated that she was screaming mad about how she got our tilapia mixed up with catfish. She got mad when my fiancé noticed because He is a Chef from Le Cordon Bleu! That didn't really bother me because the fish was good but it was her attitude that mad everything seem so sour!
My waiter took the fish off the bill which was ok but I order to pay to get the correct fish and the cook wasn't having it. Maybe we went on a bad day but my waiter made me feel welcome great service and speedy overall 2 thumbs up to him."	4	Urban Crawfish Station	4.5
"Banana nut muffin, mimosa, and stuffed French toast, who could ask for more? 

We had a party of 6 and our waitress Candice was phenomenal such a great place you should come if your in Vegas!"	5	Egg Works	4.5
Had the steak frites for breakfast. Yeah I know what was I thinking right? This was the best steak I have ever had. Seriously. Ordered rare and just melted in my mouth. The fries were delicious and piled on high. A bit pricey but It was well worth it. My friend had some type of belgian waffles(bananna maybe) and my other friend had some type an omelet. I forget, I was paying attention to my food. I wasn't even drunk either because like I said we went for breakfast. Pricey food but well worth it in my opinion. The service was on point. The server recommended an excellent wine as well. I believe it was a syrah? Not sure what brand or year. I'm not a connoisseur when it comes to wine, but it balanced out well with my meal. I would definitely eat here again and maybe even actually order breakfast during breakfast time. Ha but I couldn't pass up the steak. I would definitely eat here again. Go eat there right meow.	5	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
"Way across the other side of Wynn from the Tower rooms, totally worth the walk to get some easy, quick food. But it's really the dessert stuff that makes it live up to its name.

Went here after a work dinner (very expensive restaurant, dessert didn't appeal) when I knew I needed something sweeter than what was offered at the other place. Headed to this place, hesitated slightly when I was the frozen alcoholic treats, but zeroed in on my original choice to get a bananas foster sundae.

When you're coming into the Wynn from the strip it's one of the first places you'll get to. Refreshing on many levels."	4	Sugar & Ice	3.5
"My work hosted a prix fixe dinner here at a private room upstairs. Started off with passed appetizers, tiny poke tuna bits on fried won tons, veggie spring rolls, and tiny open burgers, all very good. During dinner, the salad was very good, followed by an excellent crab risotto. Dinner was a choice between fillet mignon and fish in miso with cold soba noodles. I had the fish, which was by far the worst of the four courses for me - fish was too salty (which is saying a lot, since I like my food salty) and it just didn't go well with the cold noodles. Thankfully, dessert in the form of a chocolate heaven (think of a large decadent kit kat) saved the rest of the meal. 

Overall, it was a pleasant surprise, wouldn't mind going back. However, there are so many good restaurants to try at Caesars, I don't know about a repeat visit here without trying those other places first."	3	Chinois	2.5
"Being a Top Chef fan, my curiosity got the better of me when I was deciding where to celebrate my husband's and my birthdays. I wanted to see if those aspiring contestants had reason to listen to Tom Colicchio.

Having been to Aureole the previous evening, I figured it was going to be difficult to top. But man, top it did. Classy decor, friendly and knowledgeable servers was just the tip of the iceberg.  

I don't think I need to repeat what others have said about food specifics because we had a similar experience with everything from the steak and scallops, to the sides and dessert and wine (the wine pairings could not have been better).

Let's just say in general, they had the kind of quality food that makes you hum things you normally hear coming out of a bedroom. The only reason I am glad I can't go to this restaurant more often is because I'd probably explode from the hedonism I'd subject myself to by not being able to resist eating here as much as I could.

Top Chef wannabees, Tom walks the walk. It would serve you well to listen to what he has to say."	5	Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak	4
"Went here for a business dinner so I didn't see the bill, but I gather it was quite pricey given the ambiance and its locale. Our group wanted to go safe ""pedestrian"" which ended up being fine. Really did love the veggies, especially the eggplant.

Service was just fine, as was the food. I would eat here again, but honestly I'm not sure I'd necessarily go if it were on my dollar -- there seem to be a lot of other restaurants to try in the hotel first."	3	Wing Lei	3.5
"Wow ... where do I begin? From the awesome wine tower that requires a circus act to reach many of the bottles, to the ambiance, and of course the fabulous food - most amazing.

We were lucky to be in Vegas during Restaurant Week so every dining establishment offered special prix fixe menus for $50 so we took advantage of that. The appetizer selection said ""choose two per person"" but we figured, no way ... but indeed, it was true. They weren't small plates either -- the appetizers alone (we had the hoisin-style calamari, ceviche, steak and naan, and artichoke dip) filled us up with goodness. But we had to get through two regular-sized main entrees (I had the porcini and artichoke ravioli with a goat cheese foam and kale) and totally forgot they came with sides until those were set a few minutes later -- yeesh. 

Oh, and a quartet of desserts to end with -- what can I say? Top it off with impeccable service, and you have quite the winner. 

The only ""complaint"" I have (and I don't know if it even falls as one) is that the waiter assured us these plates were small since, after all, it is a tasting menu -- and as I said, if those were tasting plates, they must've been from Green Giant land. I get full thinking about this meal."	5	Aureole	3.5
"So glad to have gotten a chance to finally try this place. It's tempting to pass up since there are so many great restaurants in the hotel alone, but people in the group were up for burgers and it was a good option after several business meals.

The drinks were good. I didn't go Kobe (someday, someday), but the burger and steak fries are more than enough for me. I went purist here. Even the vegetarian in the group seemed satisfied. Which says a lot for a burger bar."	4	Burger Bar	4
I am absolutely in love with this place!  When I left Vegas, I wished I could pack it up and take it home with me! Everything from the modern decor to the location, presentation of desserts, flavors and quality of all including: chocolate candy, truffles, gelato, pastries, cakes and more are all made to perfection! Rich, creamy, delicious and absolutely worth the visit! A great place to stop by for after dinner desserts, date night while in town or to simply satisfy that sweet tooth, it's just one of those places that will make you wish you could try it all, and make you want to make return visits for more! A must return to for me the next time I'm in town! So if in Vegas, or visiting soon... I urge you to try it! I know you will return to this review later and thank me!	5	Jean Philippe Patisserie	4
While on vacation in Las Vegas, Nevada, my family and I decided to stop at Wolfgang Puck's restaurants at the MGM Grand for lunch. We didn't have reservations and still managed to be seated almost immediately upon arrival which was great! The staff was friendly and the ambience was relaxed and enjoyable. The restaurant wasn't too loud and the food was tasty. I had perfectly cooked Stripped Bass with roasted finger link potatoes and veggies with a glass of mojito. My kids had pizza and my husband had the Ricotta Gnocchi which he enjoyed. It was all delicious and I would definitely recommend it for anyone wanting a good meal at affordable prices inside the MGM.	4	Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill Las Vegas	4
My family & I decided to try this pace on a whim when trying to decide on a inexpensive quick lunch during our stay in Vegas! We had no idea what to expect but boy were we pleasantly surprised! The prices were cheap and the burgers and shakes were great! It's location is off the strip so we hailed a cab but it wasn't too far off. Getting a seat is a bit difficult because of how busy they are so I'd recommend bringing some friends to keep their eyes peeled for tables that might open. Because as quickly as a seat is emptied, it is filled and so it's a bit of a challenge if you're wanting to sit in. Other than that, a must try for those who love a good burger without the hefty price tags while in Vegas!	4	In-N-Out Burger	4
I'm so glad I wore my leggings. I swear they serve the best fried chicken ever. Crispy and JUICY af fried chicken. I can't stop thinking about it. Their carving station is winners. Make sure to save room for the dessert bar. Definitely one of the best buffets I've been to in Vegas. I'll be back again for the fried chicken and prime rib fo sho.	5	The Buffet	3.5
I ordered the corned beef and hash and was extremely disappointed by it. I've eaten here before and the food was great! Very let down this time. Probably will not be coming back.	2	The Cracked Egg	4
This place has my all time favorite sushi burrito, The O.C., but I ordered the boba and it is noooo bueno. The pearls were very hard and cold. I'm gonna keep coming back, but definitely not for the boba.	3	Mr Poké Bowls & Rolls	4
The beef and meatball soup is some of the best I've ever had!! The egg rolls are delicious and the service was spectacular. To be quite honest as good as, if not better, than grandma's!!!	5	Khun Chai Thai Restaurant	4
I was deffinetely not impressed with this place....the atmosphere was usual for a small sushi bar and my girlfriend and I sat down at a table.  The server came by and gave us menus and seemed polite enough.  I would say the service was good but the server's lack of knowledge was very irritating.                                                                                                                                  First off when we asked the server about anything she had to run back and ask the sushi chef about a roll.  This happened 3 times !!!  I wasn't worried though because I heard they had good sushi...                                                                                                                                    So I ordered the kiss of fire (which is better at sushi loca) and dantes inferno.  The kiss of fire had a good texture and taste, it had the perfect amount of crunch and spice (this is where they get the 2 stars).  The dantes inferno was very blah though and the white fish tasted like it came out of the lake in desert shores.  My girlfriend ordered the chef's special roll, the server didnt know what it was (surprise surprise).  She didn't like it and ate hardly any, oh and it cost 14 dollars.                                                                                                                                     So by this time we were ready to get the hell outta there.  We didn't get a refill on our drinks the whole time and we wanted fountain drinks to go.  The server went to get our drinks but came back with only my girlfriend's iced tea.....sighhhh she claimed she only had one styrofoam cup.  Whatever this place sucks	2	Yummy Grill & Sushi	4.5
I ate here tonight with my wife and family and let me just say that sushi bomb totally exceeded my expectations.  The service by Danny was absolutely top notch.  He was always there when we needed another drink or another sushi roll.  The special roll au de toilet doesn't sound appetizing but it was fantastic !!  Great ambiance, great food, fantastic service.  Will be back to see Danny, service and food exceptional.	5	Sushi Bomb	4
"This is as authentic as it gets in Las Vegas! If you are looking for a good home cooked meal that will fill you up and deliver? then look no further. Their chicken katsu was so flaky and not overly breaded that it literally made my mouth water! During my visit, we had the seaweed salad - Bomb, the chicken katsu with rice - bomb, the chicken curry - bomb dot com and the potato corn karroke - deep friend bomb. overall when i go back to Vegas, I would definitely stop by here again if you are looking for a quick fix for a good price! great job Tonkatsu Kiyoshi!


Pros: 
fast service and delivery through apps
great customer service and attentive wait staff
food is delicious and price is reasonable

cons: 
parking outside sucks
small inside with tables that seat 4 comfortably"	5	Tonkatsu Kiyoshi	4.5
"Tried Burgr for the first time and true to Chef Ramsey's culinary wizardry as displayed on his TV show when helping turn around failing businesses, the meal was prepared and presented excellently.

Ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger medium well with the Truffle Fries, my wife had the Euro burger medium well with a side salad. Meat seasoned very well and cooked to order with just the right hint of pink.  Fries and salad both fresh and excellently seasoned.  Food presentation a plus!

Staff very friendly and prompt.

Definite repeat."	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
"Greet good in huge amounts with good service and cool ambience:  Farm to Fork with an eclectic twist!

Added bonus:  spicy peppered Bloody Mary bar at entrance for your enjoyment while you wait for your table to be called.

What else can be said? Great product for the price."	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
The cracker crust old Chicago was amazing. It's not often that you can taste the fresh garlic on a sausage style pizza like this.	4	Pizza Rock	4
I brought my mother here for brunch. She's a little picky with food and she loved this place.  The mimosas were  reasonably priced and plentiful.  Our server, Nan, was amazing. She was so attentive and had wonderful recommendations. I got the salmon Benedict which was falorful without being salty (as many places are), my mother got the Steakhouse scrambled which she said was the most delicious cut of meat she has had at a restaurant. All of the staff was attentive and the food was beyond excellent. This may be my new favorite brunch spot. We had several check ins  from the manager Beth, who made sure our experience was enjoyable.  I can't say enough good things about this place. If you're near Tivoli Village you must come here, hell even you're not. I traveled from Henderson, and it was well worth the drive.	5	Echo & Rig	4.5
Everything we had was delicious.  We had the oxtail risotto, crispy chicken skin, mac n cheese, butter burger, bone in pork belly,  veal meatballs,  bacon jam, and bacon bourbon brownie. Everything came out quickly and was properly cooked. I will back back very soon.	4	Carson Kitchen	4.5
I'm definitely a fan!  I was expecting sad ramen and bad Asian decor. I was pleasantly surprised to find delicious flavorful food and trendy atmosphere.  We had excellent service. My only complaint is that chili oil is extra. I'm used to a bottle or jar of it on the table.	4	Itsy Bitsy	4
So freaking good. They serve dim sum all day which is awesome. I had great service with a group and alone. They food is so fresh and flavorful. Everything is delicious and great prices.  I'm trying not to go every day.	4	Yum Cha	4

"Nora's was an unexpectes surprise. When I choose to eat out I almost never choose Italian. I'm glad we did. 

 When I arrived I saw how packed the parking lot was and but we had a reservation and we're seated very quickly. So be sure to reserve a table. The seating is quaint but comfortable and the decor has a nice mix of old trattoria and fusion bar. The staff was friendly and attentive.  We started with the caprese, calamari, and bruschetta. All were delicious and the complimentary garlic bread was a warm and we'll flavored.  My entree was the wild boar pappardelle and it was by far the most amazing thing I've eaten in a long time. The flavors perfectly melded together with a tiny bit of acidity which complimented the boar beautifully. I have only good things to say, definitely will go again."	5	Nora's Italian Cuisine	4
Had the Vegan Pizza and a glass of red wine (barbera).  $40 with uppity service at the bar. Accept all that..after all it us the "Wynn".. But the pizza was so bad had to write this review. Cardboard probably tastes better. Spinach from a can or prepackaged ? Sauce was terrible. Never usually make absolute statements at my age (66) but have say it is probably the worst pizza i have had in my life.	1	Allegro	3.5
"I went here two nights ago, and have been waiting to post this review because I am still fuming about our visit to this god forsaken establishment.

i wish to the fucking black lord that i could give negative stars... or even zero stars, but yelp forces you to give at least one, so that one star will go to #109 on the menu. the ""boat noodle soup"" that was fucking delicious... anyway... 

so while were waiting to get seated we hung out at the bar to get some refreshments. i ask the waitress what their ""thai lime drink"" was and she responds, ""it's a thai lime squeeze"". uhm okay, i understand there's a language barrier, so i ask waitress #2 and she explains to me that its kind of like a limeade except its not fresh squeezed and they use concentrate instead. im like cool, okay. we get seated a couple minutes later and waitress #2 ends up being our server and asks what we would like to drink. we order a round of waters and i ask for the thai lime drink andthis bitchhhhhh says ""oh we're actually out of that"". .......... ....... okay so uhmmm how come you didnt fucking mention that when i fucking asked you earlier what the fuck the drink was made of???!???!?!!! so then im like, okay how about thai tea? and she goes, oh were out of that too.... at this point, im trying to keep the frustration off my face and i say ""are you out of regular iced tea?"" and she says no, so im like okay thats what ill get.

they bring the drinks out and explain that their kitchen is closing in a few minutes so we need to place our orders. we order the boat noodle soup, crab fried rice, pad thai, wonton soup, crispy duck panang, crispy duck khao soi, garlic prawns, and crispy duck drunken noodles x2 (chefs recommendation btw).

as were waiting for our food we notice that the tables around us that arrived after us are starting to receive their food first... were like okay, maybe its because we had a big order, nbd. 

twenty minutes later they bring out our rice, boat noodle soup, wonton soup, pad thai, & garlic prawns. we start to eat, so far so good, delicious.

ten more minutes pass by.

then twenty.

then my boyfriend when to to go poop and when he came back he was like ""our food's still not ready?!""

finally he goes to ask our waiter...

our fucking waiter... this is what he says... ""oh i just found out our kitchen is out of duck.""

what.

what.

you're fucking joking right? 

hahahahahahhahahahaha -me at that moment.

at what point.... at what fucking point were you going to relay that message to us???? were you just going to let us sit there??? what if we had never asked about the rest of our food??? we couldn't even choose anything else off the menu because we had heen waiting so long that their fucking kitchen was closed.

clearly we were upset and we were letting them have it, and their response was ""we're so sorry, would you like a free dessert?""

hell the fuck no! why would we want dessert when we came here for dinner and obviously didn't get to eat dinner????! stupid mother fuckers.

no. no no no thats it, we've been here long enough, give us our bill.

get this guys, the bill was fucking wrong. they tried to charge us for thai tea and a coke. when the hell did we even order a coke during all of this? and why would you charge us for a thai tea that you said you're out of???!

ughhhhh im about to get an aneurysm while typing this. 

long story short, they didnt compensate us for anything and we didnt tip them shit.

fuck you guys. fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

fuckkkkkk youuuuu."	1	Lotus of Siam	4
"I love sandwiches and this place is a must! I wish I knew about this place sooner. For $5.99 a sandwich, this place is bomb!

Earl of Sandwich is located inside Planet Hollywood and is a fast food-type joint. But better. From my memory, they have about 10-12 different sandwiches and more salads and wraps. But please, try a sandwich. I ordered the Full Montagu, which has roast beef and turkey in it. I waited less than 10 minutes for my sandwich and sat in the restaurant to eat. The sandwich was quite a delight. After eating at buffets the day before, it was nice to bite into something fresh and more light. All the ingredients were fresh. I especially like tomatoes and bread. Oh the bread!! The start of a good sandwich is the bread and this place got it right. The bread was unlike other sandwich breads I've had before and it was just plain delicious. The whole sandwich left me super full and excited to come back here the next time I go to Vegas. I'm just amazed at how cheap the sandwich is. Sandwich lovers and Vegas goers, check this place out!"	5	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"My friends and I decided to try this buffet for dinner because it was part of the 24 hr buffet pass. At first sight, Cafe Lago didn't seem that promising-- the selection is very small compared the other buffets. As we passed the dessert section on our way to the table however, my judgement began to change. 

Our waiter was nice and took our drink orders right away. Then we headed straight for the food. I piled on a lot of carbs including bread sticks, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, and pasta. I needed it in my system for later, if you know what I mean. I don't know if it was because I had alcohol in me already but the food was pretty good. I really really enjoyed the bread and mac n cheese. Although I wasn't even hungry to begin with, I ate everything that was on my plate. 

And even though I just gobbled down a plate of carbs, I headed for the dessert. Everything looked good but I only had room to try the chocolate-covered strawberries and cheesecake. The strawberries were really good and I ended up eating like six of them. When I took the first bite out of the cheesecake though, I was just in awe of the taste. It was so damn good. It was almost like heaven in a little foil cup. The highlight of the meal for sure. 

If you have the 24 hour buffet pass, stop by Caesar's and at least try the dessert. It doesn't disappoint."	4	Lago Buffet	2.5
"Old School Gem

We heard about Bootleggers from a coworker and decided to give it a try. We arrived early and were seated right away at a booth per our request. We ordered Martini's and a bottle of Pellegrino. The Garlic Rolls arrived before our drinks! Our server, Alfredo (yes that's his real name) was prompt and very helpful! We started with Bruschetta and a side of meatballs. The Bruschetta was fresh and delicious and the Meatballs were the best I've ever eaten!! They were moist and bursting with flavor!! We then ordered salads Caesar and Caprese. Fresh and delicious!! We also ordered a bottle of Bongiovanni Barolo, which Alfredo suggested decanting (Good Call because it had sediment). It was Amazing and paired nicely with our entrees - Lasagna and Seafood Pasta. The Lasagna was the best I've ever had and the Seafood Pasta was packed full of Calamari, Scallops, Shrimp and Crab. My only complaint is the shrimp was slightly over cooked. For dessert we ordered the Cannoli - to die for!! I also wanted to mention the piano player. I didn't get his name but he had a great voice and was a dead ringer for Sinatra! I requested Tom Jones but he didn't know any of his songs and he said he would learn for our next visit."	5	The Bootlegger Italian Bistro	4
We made reservations for Stack based on an Open Table 1000-pt opportunity for a pre-show dinner (we had tickets for Beatles Love). We arrived on time and were escorted to a requested quiet, romantic booth. Our server, Juan introduced himself and said that our co-server, Heidi, would also be assisting. We were given paper menus for the food, which were difficult to read with the dim lighting and our 50+ eyes, and tablet with the drink menu, which was interesting. We ordered martinis (very pricey) and asked for a sample of an "unfiltered" Belvedere Vodka, which Juan was happy to accommodate. We ordered a simple Caesar Salad (all salads serve 2 - thus the seemingly outrageous price), I had the King Crab Cocktail and hubby had the Swordfish Steak. The food was delicious and was well prepared and seasoned! The only complaint is that halfway through the meal Heidi showed up and introduced herself and that was the only time we saw her. We had already told Juan that we were going to the show and hoped that he would time everything appropriately. Evidently, he didn't communicate that to Heidi and there a scramble at the end to get the check and pay in order to make the show. All in all, we would return and would love to try some of the other selections on the menu.	4	Stack Restaurant & Bar	4
We had heard from several people around town that this was a great place and it did not disappoint!! We decided to give it a try for a late lunch on Saturday. We opted for outdoor seating and were taken to a section completely to ourselves. We ordered the Duck Fat Fries with Bacon and Caramelized Onion Dip - YUM!! We wanted to order a beer but were overwhelmed by all the choices. Our server asked what styles we liked, made recommendations and brought us samples. We loved what we got. We decided to order a couple of appetizers instead of entrees since there were so many things on the menu we wanted to try! I got the Duck Wings and Hubby ordered the Calamari. Both were Outstanding!! I happened to mention that we were celebrating my birthday and our server brought me a Mini Dark Chocolate Souffle that was Divine!! We will definitely be back and next time I will be ordering the Pastrami Benedict!!	5	Yard House	4
We decided to give Delmonico's a try because we had received a special notification through American Express. I had been to Delmonico's in New Orleans many years ago and my Hubby and I frequented Emeril's in Orlando when we lived in Tampa. We were not disappointed!! I had requested a romantic booth and that's exactly where we were seated!! This experience was wonderful and memorable! For starters, our wait staff was Amazing! Kudos to Mark, Dan and Tyke. We started with the Carpaccio and Green Salad - both fresh and delicious! I ordered a special Ribeye that was not on the menu that Mark told me about. Divine! Hubby got the Japanese Waygu and said it was the most tender Ribeye he had ever eaten! For wine, we opted for a 1\/2 bottle of a 2007 Chateauneuf-du-Pape that was perfect for our entrees. For dessert, we got the Chocolate Decadence Cake that was delicious! The only negative was the Pistachio Ice Cream had shells in the first bite. The Manager was summoned and the dessert was taken off the bill and he offered us the choice of another dessert which we declined. Overall, a wonderful dining experience and we would gladly return!!	5	Delmonico Steakhouse	4
We were out running errands on a Saturday and had watched "Mama Mia" the night before, so were in the mood for some good Greek food! We did a search on Yelp, read the reviews and found Yassou! I was interested in the Souvlaki Plate and the guy taking our order pointed out a special that was less expensive and was a smaller lunch portion - which was exactly what I was looking for! The platter contained a skewer sampler of chicken, steak and pork and I asked for double greek salad instead of rice. All the meat was cooked nicely and seasoned well. The salad was fresh, the pita was fluffy and tzatziki was delicious. Hubby got the Big Fat Gyro and said that it was tasty and satisfying. We were too full for the Baklava but saw it and will have to give it a try next time! I highly recommend this if you are in the neighborhood and need a satisfying Greek lunch or snack!	5	Yassou	4.5
"We were in need of a quick bite before seeing a special movie event at the Regal Theatre. We spotted this place and thought we'd give it a try. 

The wood-burning oven and wood pile in the dining room gives the whole place a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Our server, Bethany, gave us a nice overview of the menu and explained their style of pizza - Napoleon - and also briefed us on the Happy Hour specials. 

We were pleased that they had $5 mini-pizzas on the Happy Hour menu since we saw several pizzas (all 12 inches only) on the regular menu that we would like to try. I opted for the Diavola and Hubby got the Emilia with red sauce instead of white. We also ordered a couple of drinks but nothing special. They did seem to have a nice selection of wines and beers and we will definitely explore this next visit when we have more time.

The pizzas arrived timely and looked delicious. Like another reviewer stated, the thin crust is crisp on the outside edges but soft in the middle. It almost seems to form a ""bowl"" as it bakes which causes this. I personally found it to be fine. What I was disappointed with was the taste. Everything was fresh but bland. I had to add salt (which I NEVER do, especially to pizza!) and red pepper flakes to give it flavor. There was certainly nothing ""Devilish"" about the Diavola!! Hubby enjoyed the Emilia and said next time that he would like to try the Settebello. 

We will come back when we have more time and try some different menu items for sure!"	4	Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana	4
We stopped in for a snack one afternoon after wandering through the shops at the Venetian. I was hoping for some little sliders so we could sample the burgers but they only had full size burgers and a very limited menu. We opted instead to split the Lobster Roll and it did not disappoint!! The bun was Buttery and it was chocked full of hunks of Lobster!! I would definitely order this again!! Hubby got a Bailey's Chocolate Milkshake and said it was so good, he would have ordered another one if we had stayed longer! I got a Blood Orange Cosmo and it was delicious! The only thing that could have been better was the service. We sat at the bar and evidently the Manager was taking care of things while the Bartender was on break. She said little to nothing to us. Took our orders, filled them and we never saw her again. The Bartender returned and we flagged him down to ask a few questions about where to order King Crab in the city. He was nice enough but not really engaging. We will definitely go back to try the Burgers.	4	B&B Burger & Beer	3
"We had high expectations for this place since it was recommended by a friend and reading the reviews but, we did not have a great first impression. We went on a Friday evening and were sat right away outside on the patio. That part was lovely. 

Our server, Ernie, was friendly and we chatted a bit about the fact that we had just moved into the neighborhood and that we were first-timers. He explained the menu and their specialties. We started with Garlic Shrimp & Chorizo Appetizer, Martini's and sparkling water. For entrees, Hubby ordered the Fried Chicken & Gravy and I ordered the Oxtail. We finished the appetizer and cocktails and waited. During that time, several tables were sat around us and those tables had received their entrees. I ordered a glass of wine to go with dinner and we waited some more. Finally, Ernie came back to the table and admitted that he forgot to put in our entree order and we needed to tell him what we had ordered again. He also said to save room for dessert because it was on them.

We weren't in a hurry so it wasn't a huge deal. Ernie brought me a second glass of wine and said it was on the house. Our entrees finally came and both were delicious. I asked for some more sauce but it never arrived. Ernie did bring dessert as promised - chocolate cake. It was not anything to write home about and definitely not worth ordering again. I ordered a Chocolate Martini and it came with chocolate sauce drizzled around the rim...only problem is that it also dribbled down the side of the glass and was very sticky to drink. 

All in all, the food was delicious, the drinks and wine were good, the patio was wonderful but the service was below standard. We will go back for the food and hopefully get a different server."	3	DW Bistro	4.5
"Went in with low expectations... Thinking it would be cheesy, expensive, mediocre food and small portions.

I was blown away on all accounts. Drinks were huge, portions were generous and the food was DELICIOUS and met the standards of a fine dining institution. 

The Ramsay brand did not let down!

P.S. Beef Wellington FTW"	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
"Fresh? Not so much at Breakfast.

$5.95 Minute Maid OJ from concentrate, cold coffee (read: been sitting in a coffee pot for a while) and a moderately cold French toast dish.

Maybe they were just waking up - everything was corrected but still missed the mark on their first attempt."	2	HEXX kitchen + bar	4
We arrived on time for our 6:30pm reservation on a Saturday evening to celebrate my wife's Food Network Premiere on All-Star Academy and were escorted to an undesirable table in the stunningly beautiful dining room. The hostess disappeared before we sat down and my husband went back to the stand to request a booth (which we thought we had specified in the reservation). We stood by the table feeling very awkward and waited while other parties were being seated around us. We were finally escorted to a large booth in the bar area that was quite satisfactory. We ordered sparkling water which was delivered promptly and then were greeted by our first server who took our cocktail order. The martinis were delivered by the Asst. General Mgr, Jason, who apologized for the table mix up. Now, onto the food. We ordered the Bison Carpaccio and it was the BEST Carpaccio we've ever eaten! We then split the Bison Filet which was unbelievably velvety and flavorful. We would definitely come back for this alone!! We wanted a nice glass of wine to go with the Bison and asked for the Sommelier. Our second server suggested a tasting of a couple selections and we decided on the Nickel & Nickel. We were told they had to open a new bottle. The wine came and we enjoyed everything until I got towards the end of my glass of wine which was full of chunks of sediment. We were treated to several desserts (most notably the Guinness Sorbet!!) because of several mix ups (Seating, Regular Olives instead of Bleu Cheese Olives that were offered, sparkling water being refilled with flat water, chunks in the wine). Jason sat down and talked to us at length regarding our experience and the mix-ups. He apologized several times and truly wanted to make everything right and obviously wanted us to return. Overall, we enjoyed most of the evening and will definitely return. We highly recommend T-Bones if you are a Local, a Foodie, a Wine Enthusiast and looking for an upscale dining experience!	4	T-Bones Chophouse	3.5
This place is just around the corner so we gave it a try on a Sunday morning. It was busy but we were sat right away at an outside table. The coffee was thin and weak, which is very disappointing for breakfast. Hubby wanted hot tea but all they had was Lipton tea bags. I ordered Eggs Benedict Florentine. It was OK. I decided I had to try a Pancake since everyone seems to gush over their selection. I ordered the Lemon Blueberry and the server asked if I would like fresh Blueberries on top. It sounded lovely, so I agreed. Wow. What a disappointment. The Pancake arrived with CANNED Blueberries...you know, the little shriveled up kind that are usually added to boxed pancake mixes. It also was lacking any Lemon flavor. Hubby ordered a meat scramble that he said was OK. All in all, I have no desire to return. I know there are plenty of other choices for breakfast in this amazing city!!	2	Stacks & Yolks	3.5
This out of the way, hole in the wall from the outside establishment, is our new favorite spot in Vegas!! We had gotten the recommendation from my new hairdresser, self-professed Foodie, Jenna Moreno. It did not disappoint!! We started off with Martini's - I had a Russian Vodka and Hubby had a Honey Pepper Vodka that was Spicy and Delicious!! We took the recommendation from our server and got the Serbian Mixed Grill (which was a sumptuous festival of sausages!!) and the Bulgarian Easter Lamb that Hubby said was the best Lamb he had ever had!! And for dessert, the "Famous Bulgarian Biscuit Cake" that was divine!! If you're in the mood for something different and delicious, this is the place!!	5	Forte European Tapas Bar and Bistro	4
This was our first visit and will definitely not be our last! We chose Marche Bacchus because we love French cuisine, read the reviews and snagged a 1000 point Table on OpenTable! We arrived and started exploring the wine shop. To our utter delight, we found one of our favorite Sparkling Whites (Saint-Hilaire) and ordered a bottle to have with our dessert course. Our table was perfect - outside right on the edge of the lake! Our server, Nicole, was wonderfully attentive and helpful. We started with the Escargot - delicious and garlicky! The bread was warm, crusty and served with real whipped butter. We decided to split the Summer Salad with rhubarb dressing - I loved it. Hubby thought the dressing was too sweet. I ordered the Veal Braciole and Hubby got the Red Wine Braised Beef - both delicious! I ordered a glass of Chateauneuf-du-Pape and Hubby got a Barolo - NICE!! We had a hard time deciding on entrees because there were so many things we wanted to try. For dessert, I had the Fromage (5 different selections with caramelized onions and peppers, grapes and candied walnuts - YUM!) and Hubby got the Warm Chocolate Lava Cake with Chocolate Gelato instead of Vanilla Ice Cream. The cake was not as warm as he expected but was delicious none-the-less. We loved the entire experience and will be back very soon!!	5	Marché Bacchus	3.5
"We wanted to grab dinner before shopping at Target and decided to give Geisha House a try. The hostess greeted us and we explained that we had never been there before. She said ""It's like Benihana"". (I wanted to laugh but refrained.) We said that we would give the Hibachi a try. She explained that it would be 15-20 minutes because there were only 2 chefs working and they both had just started their tables. She said that the bar was having a Happy Hour and they had sushi specials so we decided to give it a try. 

The atmosphere in the bar was cozy, airy and elegant. We opted for a couch and were promptly greeted with a stack of menus. We started with the Pork Gyoza ($5) which were delicious and paired beautifully with our drinks - Saki Ginger Mojito and Japanese Mule. The only negative for me was the sauce...it was a little too heavy and sweet for me. I would have preferred a light Ponzu. 

We then ordered 2 different Specialty Sushi Rolls (30% off during Happy Hour) with Spicy Shrimp, Scallops and Soft Shelled Crab - both delicious!  My only complaint is that we asked for brown rice and were told, ""I think we ran out last night and I don't know if they made any more today"". 

Our server (Crystal) and the bartender were nice and attentive. We took advantage of the Yelp Check-in special - Free Mochi Dessert. We opted for Strawberry (they also had Mango and Green Tea) and loved it! 

We would definitely go back for Happy Hour and we would also love to try the Hibachi."	4	Geisha House Steak & Sushi	4
"While standing in line at Costco, the couple in front of us were buying gift cards to Lucille's. They said we HAD to try it! I read some reviews here on Yelp and we decided to give it a go.

First of all, Hubby is from Kansas City (Bar-B-Que Headquarters of the USA) and VERY discerning when it comes to smoked meats! We decided to order a combo of Baby Back Ribs and Tri Tips. We had never heard of Tri Tips before and our server, Jill, did a great job of explaining the difference between them and Burnt Ends. 

The Tri Tips were tender, juicy and flavorful. The Ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious! We both were not impressed with the Original or the Memphis sauces, but the Hot and Spicy sauce was excellent!! We got Creamy Coleslaw and Honey Peanut Slaw for sides and both were delicious! We also ordered some Cornbread, which was yummy, and enjoyed the light, fluffy biscuits. I agree with other reviews that the biscuits really do not need the sugar on top!

For drinks we opted for a 1\/2 caraf of Layer Cake Malbec, a delicious and a perfect pairing for the smokey meats!! We were impressed with the ""caraf"" option for wines, as we really didn't want a full bottle. 

We will definitely be returning and highly recommend getting the Gift Cards from Costco - $79 for 2 $50 Gift Cards."	5	Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que	3.5
"We walked to Carmine's from the neighborhood for dinner on Friday evening and arrived just before 8:00pm. We opted to sit inside and were promptly greeted and told to sit anywhere we liked. We ordered 2 Club Sodas and started exploring the menu. We decided on the Fried Mozarella for an Appetizer. We liked the size of the cheese slices but they tasted like ""1980's Bar Food Cheese Sticks"". 

For entrees, I ordered the ""Meatballs on a Dish"" and Hubby got the ""Sausage Parmigiana"" Hero. My Meatballs were bland and so bad I ate 1\/2 of one out of 4. The sauce was also thin and tasteless. The Sausage on the Hero was also bland and the only good thing to say about it is the bread was really delicious! We were too disappointed to order dessert. We paid our $36.00 tab (That included a generous tip) and left. We probably should have opted for the Pizza but so many things were described as ""homemade"", we decided to go a different way. I guess you live and learn!"	3	Carmine's Pizza Kitchen	4.5
"Go for the Steak!

We chose Heritage Steaks because we were going to a show and wanted an upscale dining experience at the Mirage. We made reservations on OpenTable and requested a quiet, romantic table. We got a table on the far Left outer edge of the dining room. My husband has to have his back to a wall or be facing the the front door, so he got to sit on the cushion side and I got to sit in a chair facing him and the wall. I didn't mind the view of him, but it was somewhat disappointing only seeing a wall. He also noted that we seemed to have been sat in the ""family & tourist"" section, despite being locals and OpenTable members. On to the food! We ordered the Shrimp Cocktail to start and I have to say it was Delicious!! The shrimp were Huge and the sauce was delectable! I wanted to order another one as my entree but decided to try other things. Next, Hubby got a Caesar Salad that was perfectly satisfying and I got the Crab fondue. The fondue was weird...plenty of crab but it was sitting on top of mashed potatoes and needed more salt and pepper. I wouldn't order it again. We ordered a Barolo from the Somolier and he decanted it for us. We split the Bone-in Ribeye and it was cooked perfectely medium-rare, gorgeous flavor and cut like butter! We also added King Crab on the side - Wonderful!! We also got a side of Onion Rings but could only eat a couple of them because we were full!! We would love to go back for dessert. All in all, it was a great experience and the food was worth going back for!!"	4	Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak	3.5
Loved sitting in the Dining Room instead of outside. It was my Birthday and we were dressed up for an evening out. The restaurant is beautiful and the seating was very European with the tables close to each other. We ordered the house "Gabitini" and they were lovely but very pricey. We started off with the Escargot and it was Garlicky and Buttery just like we like it. I ordered the Bone-in Ribeye Med-Rare but it came out Medium. I sent it back and they fired up a new one that was cooked perfectly. The Quality of the Beef was not very good so I cannot recommend it for the price. I wanted a glass of wine with my steak and our server made a couple of recommendations and poured us samples from the wine cart. Her suggestions were perfect and we went with a Cabernet Franc. Hubby ordered the Sole with Spinach and New Potatoes. He said it was the best Sole he had ever had. All in all, it was a lovely dinner and I would not hesitate to return!	4	Mon Ami Gabi	4
We received a gift card and thought we would give it another try. We came at 11:30am on a Saturday and were the only ones in the restaurant the entire time. I ordered the "Screamin' Burrito" and there was nothing that screamed at me. I ordered some extra "Mr Lee's" sauce on the side (I suspect it's just jarred Harissa) and that helped. Hubby got the "Wahoo's Bowl". He said everything was very dry and bland and the only thing that "saved" the dish was the "Spicy Cajun White Beans" which he really liked. Overall, the ingredients are fresh. The atmosphere is comfortable. The service is friendly.	3	Wahoo's Fish Tacos	3.5
"We were at Red Rock Casino to experience the new Star Wars movie and afterwards wanted a bite to eat, but nothing extravagant. We had dined at Yard House and Lucille's before but were in the mood for something different. After reviewing our options, we chose Salute.

We were promptly greeted and whisked to a table. The location wasn't great, but since the restaurant wasn't busy, it was a fine, very small, table for two in the middle of the high traffic, area of the restaurant. (Later in the evening, 2 servers drove by in rented, handicapped scooters...I guess it was the evening's entertainment?!)

Our server, Mike, was engaging and assisted us in making our selections. He assumed we wanted tap water but we ordered a big bottle of Pellegrino to start. We didn't order anything outrageously expensive or unique. We both wanted Caesar Salads ($10 each), to split the Seafood Risotto ($24), and 2 glassed of Sangiovese ($9 each).  

The salads arrived and they were perfectly sized and delicious. We had to ask for fresh, cracked pepper and the server who brought it didn't know how to adjust the coarseness of the pepper. No wine arrived. Mike came to the table and said, ""It looks like something is missing. Didn't you order wine?"" We reminded him of our selection and he said that the bartender was opening a new bottle. Fine. We enjoyed our salads. 

Our table was cleared and the entree arrived, split on 2 plates (very nice!). It was good. The Risotto was cooked nicely. The Calamari was tender and in perfect, bite-sized pieces. We each got 1 Shrimp, 2 small Clams and a few tiny Bay Scallops. The sauce was tasty but sparse. Still no wine.

Mike finally came to check on us and we mentioned the wine again. We promptly received 2 glasses. It was a nice wine but not sure that it was exactly what we ordered. We finished and Mike brought us our check. I was disappointed that the wine wasn't taken off the bill. I asked the hostess for Mike. He promptly came to the table. I diplomatically explained my displeasure and he quickly took care of taking the wine off the bill for us. 

We tipped 20% in cash on the original amount because that's the right thing to do. We had a departing conversation with Mike and explained that we were locals, this was our first time here and that we would like to come back to try the tableside pasta."	3	Salute Trattoria Italiana	3.5

I'm sure  the food is good but the on-line menu is a clear bait and switch.  The prices are much higher at ricks than the original restaurant. However you won't know that till you get there.  The 2 meat and side is $20 with drink, at the original it's  $13.99 without the drink.  $7 drink.  Go to the original.	1	Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern	4

Superb service and good food. We had the carpaccio and the putenesca  and they were excellent.  We will go back and try more one the menu.	4	Sinatra	4
What a disappointment. Last time in Vegas the food was great, place was clean and service superb - not anymore. We had a late lunch on Feb 22 and service was adequate, but my wings were dry and over cooked. I asked for a meat lovers Bloody Mary and was told I could not have one at that time of day. The facility itself is not clean and seems run down, plus the hostesses along with staff seemed bored with life. What a shame - we'll spend our money somewhere else.	1	Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar	3.5
Last time in Vegas this was the best burger I had ever had - not anymore. I ordered my wagu burger medium rare and it was cooked well done and barely a decent burger at that. Service was absolutely BORED with life and we were at the bar, which usually provides great service. We would have been better off at Burger King. What a disappointment.	2	BLT Burger	3.5
Last day of vegas behind heading to the airport. We have 5 different dish. Panang curry, combination fried rice, garlic chicken, wanton soup and Pai Thai. First this is the first Thai restaurant that don't serve yellow curry. We heard from the other group said the same thing as well. All the food was below average in my opinion. The panang curry doesn't have any curry favor​, it was made by the peanut butter. The combination fried rice has too much moisture in it. Garlic chicken little too favorful, but if eat it with rice. It will be fine. Pai Thai was kinda disappointing. It lacks favor and it doesn't taste like Pai Thai. It tastes like Chow mein instead. Let's talk about good points for this restaurant. The service from the staff is good and the food come out quickly. The price and food portion is average. Overall, due to the below average of food I probably won't come back.	2	Kung Fu Thai & Chinese Restaurant	3.5
"Please please avoid.....at ALL costs!!!!!!!

Arrived in Vegas on Saturday afternoon and was looking for a meal to help soak up the alcohol soon to be consumed.  

We entered and walked up to the podium at about 7pm.....NOT BUSY AT ALL yet we waited a good 5 minutes to be seated.  We walked through the ENTIRE dining room, up some stairs, and were seated, by ourselves in a corner while the rest of the dining room was half full at best. 

No worries though, we were willing to stick it out..  15 minutes and NO SERVER.  So we decide we are going to sit in the bar which was about 1\/3 full.  We sat and were'nt even acknowledged by ANY staff.  About 15 minutes after sitting I flagged down a waitress and asked if anyone was going to take our order.

She seemed like a full on tweaker.  She responded with ""yeah you want drinks?  you ready for the whole thing now?  What do you want?""  I ordered our drinks and before I could get the second drink past my lips she was high tailing it away from me......I literally had to run (walk fast) after her to let her know that I wasn't done.  Finally was able to order Chicken Stir Fry Hibachi style.

Drinks came quickly because the bartender walked them over himself.  Not so much for the food..........1 hour later the food came out (again, the bar was about half full at this time) and it was WRONG!  It was shrimp and chicken stir fry.  My wife is DEATHLY allergic to shrimp so needless to say I wasn't having this.....especially after waiting 1 hours for our food.  I told the waitress that the order was wrong and she quickly apologized and grabbed the plate and disappeared............for 2 minutes then came back with our ""correct order"".  Upon inspection, and tasting we realized that all they did was pull the shrimp out of our food and send it back.....STONE COLD!!!!!!!!!!

Luckily my wife dug into an area on the dish where there was no shrimp.  I would have owned this restaurant, shut it down, and take a dump right in front of where this restaurant used to be just to remind people of what they are missing.

I asked for the manager......was blown off.....waitress apologized......I wasn't having it......refused to pay bill......walked out!

HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!  Don't get sucked in!  Go eat somewhere else."	1	Kahunaville Island Restaurant	3
Great food under $3. But I'll warn you once you've had one you'll want to try them all. The staff is very nice and helpful. The only problem was the gentleman in the entrance, he thinks he's being funny but he's really being rude. Overall it was one of the best restaurants in Vegas as far as Mexican food.	4	Tacos El Gordo	4
"My visit this morning to Panera Bread, I stopped in to buy a gift card for a friend's birthday.  While waiting in line decided to order the egg white\/avocado\/cheese\/tomato whole wheat bagel sandwich ...

1.  The counter girl didn't ask for my Panera number.
2.  From the time I placed my order (to go) and they called my name, almost 10 mins!
3.  10 mins wouldn't be so bad, but a lady that arrived significantly after me was called right before me.
4.  The sandwich looked nothing like the poster.
5.  The sandwich was cold."	2	Panera Bread	3.5
"Obviously a business that thrives on one-time only visits (i.e. tourists), I'm a local and I won't  be going back.
1.  Drive-thru took about 20 mins.
2.  I ordered only one thing ... a classic grilled chicken sandwich, was one of the driest sandwiches I've ever had.
3.  The help can't speak nor understand English.
I guess I shouldn't be that surprised, oh well."	2	McDonald's	1.5
Went with a group of 11.  Service was decent, what can you expect with a large group?  Ordered the mixed fajitas and asked for the black beans instead of the refried beans.  Food was ok, nothing to write home about.  Total was $38 including tip for one plate of fajitas and one margarita ... a little pricey.	3	Lindo Michoacan	3.5
"Just finished a good workout at 24 Hour, thought I would try this place out ... wanted some healthy carbs and protein, ate in.
Pros:
1.  Ordered the Penne Romano pasta dish.  Tasty blend of whole wheat pasta, chunks of chicken, and tomato-based sauce.
2.  Good serving size ... not too much and not too little.
3.  That wait time was appropriate.  Two other parties there, they had already been serviced.
4.  Place was clean, ambiance was average.
Cons:
1.  The VERY young girl working the counter wasn't knowledgeable about the menu at all.
2.  The biggest negative, same problem as Mike D three days ago on 2\/11\/15.  First, the prices changed, but they didn't update the menu.  Second and to make matters worse, after I ordered, the counter girl didn't even mention the prices had changed.  She rang me up like nothing had changed and only when I looked at the receipt and told her the price was wrong, did she say the prices had gone up.
In Summary ... good food, very poor business practices, need some work there Brian."	3	Muscle Maker Grill - Las Vegas	3.5
I agree with a lot of the recent reviews, service is lacking at this store.  Went in on a Monday night around 8pm.  First, the brown rice was not ready ... had to wait approx. 5 mins.  Second, they were completely out of pico de gallo.  So for $7.10, my bowl looked pretty skimpy.  I've noticed the amount served varies greatly from one Chipotle store to the next.  I will be skipping this store next time.	2	Chipotle Mexican Grill	3
Went thru the Drive-thru and ordered one breakfast (Denver omelet).  As i'm pulling out of the Drive-thru I check the breakfast and it's the wrong breakfast.  Now I have to park and go inside (kind of defeats the purpose of the Drive-thru).  I wait a few mins while the girl at the counter is taking someone's order, then another girl walks up with a bag in her hand (she already knows why I'm there and apologizes).  Got to work, ate the omelet, it was ok ... nothing to write home about, but at least with the tomato slices and whole wheat bread it was very healthy.	2	Farmer Boys	3.5
This place is good, torn between 4 and 5 stars.  My first visit, so guess I'll stick with the 4 stars for now.  Good food, large extensive menu, great service.	4	Mount Everest India's Cuisine	4.5
"Overall, we gave this place a thumbs up (7 in our group).  The tamales are large with a lot of meat ... we had pork, chicken, and beef, they were all good.  I can't tell you how many tamales I've had that were WAY to much masa for the amount of meat, these are not that.  Basically, they do taste like homemade, not like some uber-modern eatery that's doing all these things to them.  Service was good (not great), ambiance was good, etc.  Really liked the fact that you can order tamales a la carte, didn't want to fill up on rice and beans which are usually very mediocre.  Here's the deal with pricing ... if you order singles, they are $4.50 each (ouch).  If you order a half dozen, they are $3.00 each and for a full dozen, $2.00 each.  Since we had a large group, we ordered 18.  So if you can order more (to eat there or take home), you will save a LOT.

I don't understand a lot of the other reviews.  I lived 50 years in CA (Orange County, Bay Area, San Diego County) and RARELY found a good tamale there.  First, don't complain about salt.  A lot of people don't want or can't eat salt, so put your own f*cking salt on.  And the same goes for hot sauce.  A number of people in our group ordered very spicy hot sauce and put their own on, each to there own.  I don't like mine spicy.

Btw, the men's room didn't have any paper towels."	4	Doña Maria Tamales Restaurant	3.5
First time I have been to this location, usually I go to Tropicana and Jones.  Sunday morning at 10am, they are all out of egg (white and yellow) for breakfast sandwiches which are by the way, are served all day.  Also out of olives, and something else (I forget right now).	2	Subway	2.5
"I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars.  I've only been once, so I'm think 4 is probably more appropriate for a single visit.
First, we were there on a Friday night at 10:30pm and sat right down.  Service for us was GREAT ... from the bus boys to the servers.  And I'm the kind of guy that WILL tip less (or not at all) for bad service.
Second, I felt the price of the tacos was right in line for what you get.  These are definitely not your regular street tacos (which I like too).  For two us .... 4 tacos, one beer, and tip came to $21 (no complaints).
Third, the tacos were really good.  Only got to try two, so looking forward to going back and trying some of the other creations.
Fourth, probably my only complaint (and it's a small one) is that I feel for ANY restaurant that serves a lot of finger food, they should have hand sanitizer all over the place ... very accessible.  With that said, I did go to the bathroom to wash my hands.   :)"	4	Tacos & Beer	4
"1.  I've only ordered to-go (about 10 times), so I can't really comment on the in-dining service.  I always call in when leaving from work (at least 20 mins away), so the food is always ready and waiting when I get there.
2.  Everything I have ordered so far (especially the yellow curry with chicken) has been very good.
3.  I think they are very reasonably priced."	4	Aranya Thai Bistro	3.5
Like all the other reviews stated, it's a very small location and crowded (especially during lunch).  Like the whole Healthy and Not-so-Healthy concept.  The wait wasn't really that long, no seating was available so we took it back to the office.  The box and bag seemed a little over the top, but I guess that's their "thing".  I really like good-tasting, reasonable, healthy food.  Ordered the Chickhumm sandwich with fruit as the side, VERY pleased.    :)	5	SkinnyFATS	4.5
Have to agree with Billie N. five days ago.  We had a larger group (10) and sat at the grill and the service was VERY slow.  I had the shrimp & ny steak combo, it was ok ... nothing to get too excited about.  Everyone else seemed content with their meal (all grill food) but I didn't hear anyone commenting how good it was.  I'm in the 2.5 star range.	2	Hikari	4
"1.  Two of us went last night at 7:30pm, thought there wouldn't be too much of a wait on Wed night.  Ended up waiting 30 mins, but when they sat us there were plenty of empty tables.  Turns out we were basically the last ones waiting for a table.
2.  We never did get a basket of bread, not sure what the other reviews are talking about.
3.  Only two soup selections ... Lobster Bisque and Cream of Mushroom.  As I'm lactose intolerant ... no soup for me!
4.  Ordered the chicken limone (picata) ... it was pretty good.
5.  Price for two entrees, one soup, one tea, one mineral water .. almost $80 with tip.  A little on the pricey side.
6.  Other reviews mentioned going here for date, disagree!  Way to noisy and not all all intimate.  MUCH better places to take a date."	3	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
"Stopped in on a Saturday around 10:15am for breakfast, no other customers (should have taken that as a sign).

Pros:
1.  Large patio that is dog friendly!   :)
2.  Very extensive lunch menu.
3.  Very good omelets (about the only thing they had for breakfast)

Cons:
1.  VERY limited breakfast menu.
2.  For the only two customers in the place, service could have been a little bit better.
3.  I know it's probably a very European thing to have salad with every meal (even breakfast), but I'm not a salad person at all.  The option to have fruit (fresh or frozen) would have been appreciated and not that much effort. 
4.  I'm lactose intolerant and heavily suspect there was dairy in the omelet  ... feeling the pain the next day.

If Yelp had a half-star, I would probably give this place a 2.5 stars."	2	Strip View Cafe	4.5
Haven't been to this Panda Express (or any other one) in a long time, thought I would give it a  try.  Got the mushroom chicken and honey-walnut shrimp.  For $1.25 extra, the honey-walnut shrimp should be pretty darn good, it was just ok.  Like the rest of the meal (and what other reviews have said), ok place to stop by if you are hungry but not for really good food.	2	Panda Express	3
"In just one visit this has easily become my favorite breakfast spot. I had the BLT bloody mary which was absolutely delicious, I think I finished it in one gulp! It was a good size, with a piece of toast, bacon, and lettuce and tomato garnish. Followed by the sage chicken benedict, again absolutely delicious. The portions are huge. I had breakfast and took enough for lunch to go and still did not finish it all. 

This is the best bang for your buck in Vegas. My meal was $19, easily split between 2 people would have been $8\/person! You can't get this much food, let alone good food, for $8 at McDonalds!  

Be prepared to wait.. we went on a Sunday morning and it was a 45 minute wait for 2. We were lucky enough to get seats at the bar within 10 minutes. This was fabulous and my boyfriend got to watch football. 

I will make this a MUST STOP in every city with a location."	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
"Best Buffet in Vegas! Sets itself apart from the others. We purchased the buffet of buffets pass and paid the additional to eat here for dinner one night. This was for sure the best meal in the 24 hours. We had dinner the night before and then breakfast, waiting until about 7:30pm to make sure we were our hungriest! It was a splurge.. and I would probably skip the 24 hour pass on my next visit and only visit Bacchanal. This food had much more flavor than the other buffets, better and more high end options. I think my boyfriend and I shared at least 3 plates of crab legs, snow, king and steamed. ALL delicious! There is sushi, pho and ramen. There are all the options of a steakhouse. The desserts are truly amazing, I got pretty much one of everything and had a bite of each. I was hoping to have room for the crepes.. but just didn't make it lol 

Service was good, drinks were brought and refilled quickly. Napkins and fresh silverware brought upon request. 

Protip: Visit one of the new dispensaries in town.. and then hit up the buffet ;)"	5	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"If you find your self having to make use of the lavoratory do make sure to check that toilet paper is available before doing your business.

Food was ok."	2	True Island BBQ	4
"I got the Chasu Kome Miso and Esther got the shiro miso. Both broths were rich and tasty. Esther really liked hers since it's not as oily and we both really liked the noodles. They're thicker and have a good consistency. The Chasu is tasty but could be a bit more tender. Otherwise we liked it! 

They also have a happy hour between 5-6 - during ours we could get free extra noodles :)"	4	Go!ku	4
My breakfast at Bouchon was phenomenal, it was perfection and then some.  I ordered the Sourdough waffles which had bananas and toasted walnuts, and my friend ordered the Bouchon french toast.  The presentation of the meals was gorgeous and just added to the ambiance of the restaurant.  The service was also on point, we really felt that we were being treated like royalty.  The waiter spoke of chicken with waffles, which is one of their specials, I would love to try that next time I dine at Bouchon.  And you can bet money on it that there will be a next time  :)	5	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
"Walked in here randomly with my friends and sat down for lunch, was pleasantly surprised by the dishes, they had some really creative items on the menu.  My meal was a BLTA (bacon, lettuce, tomato, + avocado) and home-cut fries, and it was a unique twist on a classic, it was served open faced on a crispy grilled baguette.  A large and tasty sandwich!  My friend ordered the macaroni & cheese with doritos, which was very tasty.  You'd never think to sprinkle some doritos on mac & cheese, but in this case, it worked!  My other friend ordered a burger and shoestring fries, and after trying the shoestring fries, I wished I ordered some. 

We sat in a booth that offered a really nice view of the strip.  This is a nice place to have lunch or drinks, and it's located in a convenient location within the Palazzo."	4	First Food & Bar	3.5
Had a lovely dinner at the Pearl.  My friends and I ordered the $49 pre-set option.  My meal consisted ot hot\/sour soup, General Tso's chicken, beef tenderloin, fried vegetable rice, and a raspberry chocolate cake.  I loved it all, except I was not too crazy about the hot and sour soup.  A bit too salty, and a bit too thick.  But as a whole, the meal was nice.  I tried one of their custom cocktails called "Beautiful," and am glad I made that choice.  It was a nice refreshing cocktail with fresh strawberries.  The restaurant's decor was very clean and minimalist, the focus is definitely on the food here.  I would consider dining here again on a future Las Vegas trip.	4	Pearl	3.5
I absolutely loved this buffet.  My friends and I chose the option that gave us unlimited mimosas in addition to the buffet, and we could not have been happier.  The food was incredibly fresh, and the presentation was beautiful.  Some of my favorites were the macaroni and cheese, truffles gratin, shrimp miso salad, lamb\/ricotta gnocchi, and the french toast.  All phenomenal.  In terms of dessert, it was lovely.  Almost too pretty to eat!  My favorite was the coconut panna cotta in an egg shell.  A wonderful way to end the meal.  I will definitely return here.  Plus, you get the opportunity to walk through the uber-chic Cosmopolitan hotel on your way up to the buffet!	5	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"Yes! Finally! A spot I came to in Vegas that I LOVED! Let's get the bad out the way. Service isn't quite hitting here. The hostess who sat us put us in the corner so we were out of sight, out of mind. It took us nearly 15 minutes before the waitress even came out to take our drink order. After that, everything we got just took longer and longer for her to return. I thought this was going to be another 2-3 star Vegas joint until the food came.

I got the BBQ pork nachos. They were OFF THE CHAIN. PLENTY of nachos! Great tasting BBQ sauce. Pork was perfectly tender and covering all of the nachos as they claim. The cheese hit it all off wonderfully. I got a pomegranate margarita; it tasted great and was very potent, loved it.

My wife and I split a fried ice cream dessert. It was certainly ON POINT. The ice cream was really good, accompanied by the perfect crunch of the ""fried"" shell and the nachos and the drizzled syrup makes it very tasty. Awesome place overall; wish there was one in Chicago! If they can improve their service, it would be a 5-star hit every time!"	4	Nacho Daddy	4
"Nice establishment here. My wife and I grabbed a Groupon to check out this place and came here last night for dinner since we both love Indian food. I got the Lamb Korma with 9\/10 spice level and my wife got the Chicken Vindaloo with 8\/10 spice level.

Both dishes tasted excellent perfect combination of Indian spices and flavors. They certainly lived up to the level 9 heat level as my nose was running halfway thru my meal. Only drawback is that they only gave us one small saucer of rice to split for both of our meals but the waitress was nice enough to give us a little more rice complementary upon request.

Service was good. Our waitress was friendly and the food came out in a reasonable time but it wasn't busy in there when we were in there so it's hard to tell how they perform when busy. Otherwise, nice place to visit if you want some Indian food."	4	Pure Indian Cuisine	4.5
"YES!! FINALLY! My first place in Vegas worthy of a FULL 5 stars! If I could give more, I would! This is how breakfast should be throughout the entire city! Came here off the reviews (thanks yelp!) and wasn't disappointed.

We walked in and were pleasantly greeted by the hostess. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, gave me a sample of the gravy to try. So I got a mama's stack with eggs and sausage and my wife got eggs & turkey bacon with a single pancake.

First off, I must give this disclaimer, the pancakes are HUGE! Don't make the mistake I made and underrate them like I did. I could've easily filled up off a short stack. Not only are they big but they're fluffy as tasty. The eggs and sausage was great as well. Coffee tasted amazing! The waitress even gave us cups to go. This place has breakfast and Customer service to a T. Trust me, COME HERE for breakfast. You WON'T regret it."	5	Mr Mamas	4.5
"Meh. Let me start by saying I'm from Chicago. We may not have the most renown BBQ in the country but we have some pretty good BBQ spots. Therefore, I must admit that when it comes to recognizing a good BBQ joint, it's hard to pull a wool over my eyes.

So this place, great service. The guy who took our order was nice; our food didn't take ridiculously long to come out. My wife and I split a trio with chicken, hot links and spare ribs. For $17 & some change, I was disappointed with the portion sizes. 1 hot link (not sure why they said linkS), 2 medium size spare ribs, 1 chicken drumstick & 1 thigh. Sorry, I may be spoiled by Chicago's fine eating rep but $17 at a BBQ joint in Chi-town typically gets you A LOT MORE. I also decided to try a blackberry cobbler (the menu says blueberry but they have blackberry)

Food wise, it was ok. The rub on the ribs were ""OK"" (I've definitely had better). They weren't super tough but they weren't slide off the bone tender, they were somewhere in the middle. The hot link was actually good but it wasn't a smoked hot link that's standard for a BBQ joint but a pork hot link. The chicken was ok. My wife didn't like the seasoning on it so she peeled back the skin & put BBQ sauce on it. The blackberry cobbler was descent but considering the stark tartness of blackberry, it could've been sweeter to offset the tartness. Likely won't be back here next time in Vegas."	2	Rollin Smoke Barbeque	4.5
"Wow, that was a mildly disappointing breakfast I just had. Walked in here, got past the bizarre setup they had for getting seated. Wait wasn't long, got seated pretty quickly. Soon as we sat down, off jump we noticed that ALL of our utensils were dirty so I immediately told our waitress that we had ""anther guest"" coming so we can get an extra glass of water to rinse our utensils in. In fact, the entire restaurant seemed dirty; there was dirty in most of the corners.

The menu was ridiculously pricey. The most reasonably priced thing we saw were omelets so that's what we settled on. I got a apple smoked bacon, Jack cheese and avocado omelet with a banana muffin. I wasn't digging the omelet. They put the avocado on top; I thought it was going to be cooked in the omelet (could've at least gave me the option). The hash browns were ok, took a descent amount of salt, ketchup and Tabasco sauce to bring them to life.

The banana muffin was dry. It could've been a bit sweeter; tasted like it was diabetic-friendly. This was perhaps just about one of the worst breakfasts I've had in a while."	1	Du-Par's	4
Funny hours. First off, online they say they open at 8. That's a lie. On the door, it clearly says 9. Additionally, the sign doesn't say the cafe isn't open on Sundays but guess what, it isn't! I'm not sure what this place is like but judging by the shifty hours, I wouldn't even remotely try it!	1	Gamblers Cafe	4
Amazing restaurant, food and five star service! I came here for my wife's birthday and we were treated so well! They waitress gave my wife some chocolate truffles and a $25 gift card and a birthday card as a gift! The steaks and appetizers were delicious... And the dessert was spectacular! I reccomend this resturant to anyone especially at this location in town square. Thanks Stacey (our waitress) and flemings for a great evening!	5	Fleming's Prime Steakhouse	4
I don't how this places ratings are above a two... This place served us raw chicken wings and instant potatoes... This place seriously needs a new chef !

"Place is super expensive. At $20 a plate they can at least bring some chips without charging extra. 

It's loud and big. If you can't get a patio seat consider just pushing on. 

However, the tortilla soup is amazing. The service was excellent. 

Fish tacos had great presentation and texture but low on flavor. Nachos were standard. 

I rated it 3 considering the price."	3	Cabo Wabo Cantina	3.5

Stopped in for happy hour on a Wednesday night, the place was mostly empty and the staff was friendly, initially. Got our drinks and the bartender recommended the goat cheese and watermelon salad off of the happy hour menu so that's what we ordered. Unfortunately, after nearly an hour it still hadn't arrived and we had to go.  We would have liked to remind him, or anyone, about our order but he managed to stay at the far end of the bar and ignore us completely and all other employees seemed to have disappeared.  We even had to wave him down just to pay our tab even though there was no one else at the bar.  Really terrible bar service.  And where was the management?  The music was great and the atmosphere was comfy. The menu items sounded appealing but after this type of non-service we probably won't be back to try any of it.	2	Poppy Den	3.5
Hella good food! We ate at the bar and the bartenders were awesome! We'll be back. And they are open 24 hours and serve brunch on the weekends.	4	Giuseppe's Bar & Grille	3.5
Service was good, however we made a reservation for 11 people at 5pm but were informed upon arrival that happy hour pricing is only available at the bar or outside (105 degrees) and although there was plenty of seating in the bar area our large group would not be able to actually sit together and enjoy each other's company from multiple tables. So we sat outside dripping in sweat until we couldn't take it anymore. Sorry Brio, your loss. Luckily Double Helix can accommodate our group and happy hour is until 7:30!	3	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
Awesome new restaurant! Yummy margaritas made by a very friendly Pablo and fresh, delicious, real Mexican food!  My new favorite place in town!	5	El Mescal Family Mexican Restaurant	4
Saw a few pictures and had to try it.  Went for a late weekend lunch. The restaurant definitely needs a little TLC, and it kinda smelled funny, but the waiter was friendly and the chips and salsa were yummy, but he seemed to forget about us after he dropped them off, as it took a while for him to return with our drinks. When we finally placed our order we'd been there for quite some time and there was only 2 other tables seated.  The tacos and pupusas were delicious but my burger looked nothing like the (numerous) pictures posted to yelp and instagram.  The meat was *much smaller than the bun and had virtually none of the sauce that was supposed to be on it, and despite the burger being flavorful and juicy, it still needed the condiment.  After he dropped off our food, our waiter never came back, and that's unfortunate because I couldn't order the milkshake I wanted or request more sauce, and he forgot to put in for the chili cheese fries we had ordered so we didn't get to try them.  Overall the food was great and the photos from other diners are intriguing, so we will be back. Hopefully that was just an off-day because I really like to see unique places like this grow and succeed, but good food isn't the only thing that brings people back... service is also very important.	3	La Parrilla The Lab	4
"While in Las Vegas for a Wisconsin Badger football game myself and Brianna L decided to walk the what seemed like 3000 miles from the Monte Carlo to the north end of the Strip to eat at Peppermill when our flight got in at 11pm.

The other reviews are correct when they describe the atmosphere.  Purple, red and pink neon lights the place dimly while pretty big cherry blossom trees stick out of the floor up to the ceilings.  The booths are pretty much all circular in shape and are soft and plush.

I ordered the Ranchero Omlette and wow was it big.  Brianna L ordered the cheese quesadillas and we could've easily split either of these dishes.  Both were excellent in presentation and taste.  I had a Tequila Sunset and Brianna had a big blue drink that was pretty tasty.

Cool place that isnt new Vegas-y at all.  Friendly young women waitresses was the cherry on top for this great place to eat."	4	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
"Top of the line steak house.  I've been to many steak houses in Chicago that I've heard are considered to be best in class.  This place has officially topped the 5-8 nice steak houses I've been too.

Brianna L and I both ordered the Fillet and shrimp special of the day that had a southwestern sauce drizzled over it.  Cooked to perfection (yes they asked us to slice into it to get our approval of the cooking) we ate every single bite (they cut the fillet fresh so you can get any size you want, I think it was $2 per ounce over the base cost of an $38-8 ouncer).  We also ordered the potato's Au gratin to split and we didn't have room for desert sadly.

The sommelier as mentioned previously didn't look older than 25 but was very courteous, friendly (we are a younger couple so he wasn't to stuffy to us about the wine), and knowledgeable.  I am not too into wine (the wine book was in a ~3"" binder, quite exstensive) so he brought me the scotch\/bourbon menu to where I had a nice pour of Blantons with our Calamari.

Service was top notch:  food brought out at appropriate times, great recommendations, prompt arrival with check, etc.  They also send you a post card thanking you for your visit if you give them your address.

I would highly recommend this fine establishment.  I plan on visiting their other locations if I am ever in TX, CO, NY, FL, or NC.

Yes they did have crumb scrapers, score!!!"	5	Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House	4.5
Heard some pretty awful stuff about this hotel before booking, but I can't say enough about how awesome it actually was!  We received a King room on the 12th floor of the West Wing, which is the newer side of the hotel.  We had an updated bathroom, flat screen television and a great view of the strip.  The hotel is perfectly located so you can visit the south and north end of the strip pretty quickly.  There's a monorail stop located in the hotel so you can get around if you're dressed up and don't want to walk in heels \/ drive.  :)  Aside from the typical slots, there are great food and entertainment options including one Cirque Du Soleil show, Ka, located in the building, so you don't have to travel far to have a great time.  Finally, the service we received was excellent, the staff always friendly and there was complimentary extended check-out, free boarding pass print out kiosks and baggage holding if you have a later flight and want to explore the city more before you leave.  All in all, a great experience for the price and the location.  Definitely will consider staying here again for future visits.	4	MGM Grand Hotel	3

Greatest place to go after a work out, before a work out, on date night; anytime! The quality of the food is out done only by one thing. The quality of service, specifically Dante and Xavier they made us feel like we've been here a million times even though it was our first time. Excellent service in all aspects; these two guys deserve to be rewarded for their outright superiority in the areas of customer service and friendliness, I suggest you come in and prove me right!

Went to this restaurant for my grandson's 9th birthday party. when we arrived, we ordered drinks. I ordered a Corona light and it smelled  like a skunk. I had the waiter smell the beer and he agreed and brought a new one. Every one ordered their food. I ordered the double lobster dinner with clams and other items. The lobster was totally overcooked, the clams were like little hockey pucks. My wife ordered the jumbo stuffed shrimp and was surprised to see the size. We have had larger shrimp in shrimp salad. It was a joke. We had 10 people, and not one person enjoyed their meal. We will not be going back.	1	Joe's Crab Shack	3.5
We went here for dinner on Jan 31. I cannot have gluten or dairy. After asking the waiter what he would recommend, he had Chef Eric come to our table to talk about what dishes would best fit my dietary recommendations. He took my order on a bright yellow order pad and said it would be prepared separately. They have gluten free pasta and the meat sauce is dairy free. Everyone was so helpful and my meal was fabulous. Hubs got the regular spaghetti & meatballs and said was delish. Both meals came out at the same time and we enjoyed our dinner very much. Price very reasonable compared to the pricey resorts. Highly recommend!	5	Maggiano's Little Italy	4
Solid breakfast food, big portions - 4 egg omelets! Amazing prompt & friendly service.  I don't get the reviews that call it a dive (even if they don't mean it as an insult). Way too squeaky clean and bright to be called a dive! Even the condiment bottles looked like they get carefully wiped off, including the threads under the cap.	5	Mr. Mamas	4.5
"Again this place for breakfast is the best breakfast place in Vegas. I have ate at 4 different locations and every location is great. I have ate at the centennial location, south side on blue diamond, the location on Flamingo and the one on buffalo. Today I went with a party of 4 at the buffalo location and got seated right away. The server Jacob was professional and efficient. Here are some of the items we ordered. 

Portuguese sausage, scrabble eggs, garlic rice and a side of chocolate chip shirt stack pancakes. Kalua pig Benedict with hash browns and The French toast combo. 

A little trick with the French toast you should try. Ask for the French toast plan and ask for a side of peanut butter. Spread the peanut butter on one side of the French toast and put the other half of the French toast on top then Pour the syrup all over it. Heaven!!!!!! You can thank me later."	5	BabyStacks Cafe	4
This place is amazing. My wife and I have been looking for a sushi spot close to the house and boom! This place is bomb! Fish was fresh and rice to fish ratio was great. They even gave my kids there own colorful bowl to eat out of. The salmon belly was one of the best I ever had. Salmon skin roll was bomb and a must try. Kid friendly and just a great place to have dinner. I would definitely come back over and over again. Staff was professional and courteous. They even had a cool outside area to wait, plenty of space for your kids to run around without any worry of cars hitting them.	5	Sasa Sushi	4
This place was amazing. I ordered the Alfredo pasta shrimp. The shrimp was huge!!! Pasta was so good. And the garlic bread was amazing!! Service was amazing. I didn't even have to ask for a refill. I would comeback.	4	The Bootlegger Italian Bistro	4
It's McDonald's and we are always gonna go here because it's one block away from the house and the kids love there food. What sucks about this situation is you always have to fight for your food.

This place was amazing!!! The house beef was amazing!! A must. Also the house fried rice is the bomb!!! Service was great I didn't even have to ask for my water to be refilled.

I usually dont go here but this is the closest dim sum place. The price is good and I love dim sum. Today we got the normal stuff. Pork shomia, prok spareribs, steamed shrimp, noddles, rice, fried wontons, sugar cane fried shrimp ball, and calamari. The steam dim sum was great and hot. The fried foods was cold but if you ask the waiters to re heat they will. I would have gave 4 stars but the fried cold food killed it for me. Service is great. The waitresses are Nice and accommodate your needs. Overall I would come back and would recommend to others.	3	Hong Kong Garden Seafood & Dim Sum Cafe	3.5
"Weak. This location is not good. My wife and I was craving chicken. I decided church's. I went here and drove through drive Thru. Ordering was the worst. The screen was flickering as I was ordering and i couldn't even see what I ordered. The price was jumping all over the place. From $20 to $2,000. Lol here I what I ordered,

10 piece chicken only
5 spicy and 5 regular

4 corn on the cob

First they ran out of legs and thighs so they have breast( I hate breast). I don't get how you can run out of chicken. They didn't even ask if I wanted to wait for it to be done. Nope they just put whatever they wanted. I was in drive thru for 19 mins till I got my food. Chicken was ok and I would not come here again. Nope nope nope!!! I rather go to KFC or Popeyes."	1	Church's Chicken	2
This is my go to spot for breakfast. I love the chocolate chip pancakes. Today I got the country fried steak and eggs. Bomb!!!! I get it with hash browns. Service is great. You have to wait to be seating because it's always busy but it's worth the wait.	5	Babystacks Cafe	4
"This place is ok. It's close to my work and when I'm craving chicken I can satisfy my craving at Popeyes. Today I ordered the 3 piece combo with a medium strawberry soda. I would say the medium size soda  is like a large at other fast food places. I also got a large coleslaw. The drive thru is pretty fast so I would recommend not stoping inside. Overall I would come back for the food. 

On Tuesdays when they have there $1.99 deal for 2 pieces the place is super busy. But I've notice going around 8 pm you get fresh chicken and the lines are gone."	3	Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen	2.5
"I'm going to start by saying wow!!! I was craving BBQ. My wife told me no but I just had to fill the void in my stomach. Here's what I order,

2 meat item which comes with 2 side. 
Beef brisket
Jalapeño cheddar sausage
Cabbage slaw
Mac and cheese

The beef brisket is so tender and soft. No need for a knife. It was amazing. And don't let me get started with the cheddar jalapeño sausage. That right there is the best sausage I have ever had. The place opens up at 11 and I would come back over and over again. Mac and cheese was cheesy and the slaw was cold and fresh. 5 stars all around."	5	Dickey's Barbecue Pit	3.5
"This place is good. It's not my first option but it gets the job done. Their happy hour menu is great and fish quality is ok. Some of the rolls you must get are,

808 special
Black widow 
Island fever 
Maui special

When I come here I usually do all you can eat and get every nigiri they have. Some key fish I get are,

Unagi
Garlic tuna 
Yellow tail
Salmon
Salmon belly ( if available)
Super white tuna


Prices for all you can eat lunch from 11:30 to 3:00pm is $21.95"	4	808 Sushi	3.5
This place was remodeled. The food is always good and the service is awesome. I ordered the lobster sandwich with coleslaw which by the way was amazing and potato wedges. The whole thing was great!! Toast was crispy and lobster tasted fresh. Potato wedges was perfectly cooked and also crispy. I would also recommend the crab cake dinner. The plus side to this is they have a sushi bar for you sushi lovers. Amazing!!!	4	Brigg's Oyster	3.5
I love the wings. Quick secret I do when I order. I get the wings plan with salt and pepper but I get the sauce on the side. The chicken is crispy and the sauce doesn't Soften the chicken. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because on 2 different occasions I called to put my order in and twice I was put on hold for more then 20 mins. Today I waited 45 mins for my food. I waited patiently but it was getting really bad. Tuesday are busy because of the discount wings. I would recommend if you go on Tuesday go after 8pm, it's slower and not as busy.	2	Buffalo Wild Wings	2.5
I love this Korean Mexican fusion food. When you get here you have to get the bulgogi tater tots. I also get the bulgogi chimichanga!! So good!! Service is great and clean bathrooms. I would come back over and over again. I also got kimchi fried rice and is was bomb!!	5	KoMex Fusion	4.5
Ok place to have some real deal breakfast. Very close to my house so it's kinda the go to spot. One thing I didn't like was the eggs was kinda dry and hash browns was soggy. The biscuits and gravy was also ok. Season potatoes was great. I would only go back because it's down the street.	2	The Cracked Egg	3.5
"This is my spot. I always forget to check in but I come every Wednesday and if I miss a day I make sure I make up for it later that week lol. The workers remember me every time I come in. I usually come with my daughter on Wednesdays. My wife likes this place also but not as much as me. When ordering water you ask for a cup of Only ice. I like my water very cold and they don't give you alot of ice in your water. Service has gotten better through the times. A few things you have to get when here,

Shumai
Haw-gow
Shrimp noddle
Chowmein
Pork spareribs
Beef tendons
Fried sugar cane shrimp ball
Chinese broccoli 
Chive dumpling 
Taro 
Fried wontons
Calamari
Fried chicken
Duck

They have a lot more food on there carts but these are my go to items. I do try the other items and they are fresh and good but these items i listed are my mains lol. Enjoy!!!"	5	Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant	3.5
I am updating my review. This place is a joke. We came here for my brother In laws bday. We waited about 30 mins not bad. When we got seated we was told we had to pay $5 each for membership wtf!!! Why wasn't this told to us when we checked in at the front desk or when my sister in law called them for prices. I ordered chicken wings ( Asian zing) which was bomb but no plates was giving. I had to literally yell "canny get a plate". We had 8 mins left and the worker said would we like to extend. We said maybe can we think about it and finish our food and decide. She said no if we didn't want to extend we couldn't finish out good and we would have to get our shit and move to side. Hahahha wtf!!! I would never come back to this place or nor will I recommend it.	1	Topgolf	4
I gave them 3 stars because the food is always good. I got the lunch special for $8.95, I ordered for delivery. Food comes fast but they seem to always forget something. If I didn't live so close it would take forever to get. But the food is great. I always go back just for the food.	3	Yummy China	3.5
This place is the bomb!!! I would go back again and again and again. I love there red velvet pancakes you have to order the red velvet pancakes. I also get the garlic rice and Portuguese sausage and eggs. It's the bomb!!! Some days I crave this place. Service is top notch and waiters are friendly. Again I love this place!!!	5	Babystacks Cafe	4
"I love this place. We always go for happy hour around 11pm. Here are a few things we order,

Gyoza, this is a must!!!
Fried rice
Tacos, all of them
Lotus 
Salmon shasimi
Rock shrimp
A ice cold beer

Each order we ordered either triple or double the order. It's cheap and the quality of the food is awesome. Service is great and I have no complaints. When you check in you also get free adamame!!! Try this place, you will not be disappointed."	5	Japaneiro	4.5
"This place is amazing for lunch. Price isn't that expensive either. Today I order the ninja deluxe. Here are the items it includes for only $12 bucks plus tax. 

Beef teriyaki, shrimp and veggie tempura, 3 cali rolls, rice, soup, and a salad. 

You get all this and food is amazing!! I only ate in once I usually get pick up because work is down the street. Lunch specials are cheap and food is great."	4	Kabuki Japanese Restaurant	4
"Place was ok. The food wasn't all that great. Few things we ordered.

Half rack ribs with mash potatoes and fries. 
Stuff mushrooms
Calamari 
Ribeye steak with asparagus and mash potatoes 
Ahi tuna and chips
Pizza
Pazookie ( chocolate cookie with ice cream)

The service was great and towards the end of the meal the manager came to serve us, which I thought was weird but whatever. Overall I would only come back if I had too. I wouldn't personally pick this place if I wanted to go eat."	3	BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse	4
"This place use to be good. One thing I like is they accept cards now. Service was ok. Here are some of the things we ordered.

Pho with rare steak and all the fixings
Fried egg rolls 
Pot stickers. 

This place is not my first choice if I was craving pho but it is close by."	3	Jenni Pho	3
This place is very pricey. I wanted to get my money's worth so I had 5 plates. Service was ok. I started my my first plate with prime rib, 2 sunny side up eggs, bacon and sausages. I kept my portion small so I didn't fill up quickly. My second plate I got a bowl of oxtail pho which was amazing for a buffet. Third plate I went with a salmon lox. My fourth plate I went with mash potatoes and pork shoulder. My last plate I ended it with bone marrow with French Roll and lemon. Overall I got my money's worth. This isn't my first choice to eat buffet but food is great.	3	Wicked Spoon	3.5
"I wish I could give them negative stars!  
The front desk person told me that if we went to their restaurant and ordered food we would get a pass to their nightclub.  We went and ate their mediocre food and ordered their expensive drinks, and at the end they told us that we had not consumed enough!  Keep in mind that we stayed in the Venetian which is one of their properties, and we ordered a full dish for her, for me, and full drinks for both of us.  I would have tried to get in and pay whatever they ask, but while I was there I noticed that the people who go there are not really that good looking, in fact they tend to be the people that you would not invite to any kind of party.  If you are considering Tao, do yourself a favor and go to Surrender instead, much better place!"	1	Tao Nightclub	3
Went through the drive thru and practically had our food thrown at us as the drive thru lady was in such a hurry to rush is off. In fact she was in such a hurry she forgot to give us our drinks, and when she realized we were still sitting there she opened the window and said "what do you need?"  Horrible customer service.	1	Burger King	2
This place was overly packed. We went to eat at the restaurant and was told there was a 90 minute wait. We ventured to the bar area and eventually found a seat. Once we ordered we waited a long time for the food. I ordered a salad but my meal came out before the salad did. The waitress apologized and said sorry the kitchen is backed up. We started eating and I bit into something hard in my burger. It was a white piece of plastic in my food!  The manager was called over and he said this looks like the plastic clip that holds the burger buns, we will refund you for this meal and then walked away. No customer service skills whatsoever. The games are extremely expensive as well. Would not recommend this place. Game Works has much better customer service. Will not be visiting Dave and busters with my family again.	1	Dave & Buster's	3
Food was excellent, and we cant say enough about the gentleman who served us, he was great! We came in towards closing and he still took extra time to provide top notch service. We will be coming back!	5	O My Rice	2.5
Awesome! I am a French dip lover. And I'm constantly wanting to try from every restauraunts. This by far is one of the best next to the one at the courtyard cafe at the orleans. Also the late night specials are awesome! Oh and the fried zucchini is great!	4	Sourdough Cafe	3.5
I used to think the Vegas was lacking in a good boba joint. I guess it's been a while since I visited. I was craving some tea before continuing a road trip. I am so glad I found Brew Tea Bar. The tea was fresh and the customer service was good. The boyfriend and I told them it was our first time and they gave us some recommendations. The worker also checked up on us by first name and asked us if we needed any adjustments. My boyfriend got the Hokkaido milk tea and I got the Jasmine tea latte. Both drinks were strong in tea flavor and had the perfect sweetness. I asked for more sea salt cream to my drink and they did it with no fuss. It really hit the spot. The boyfriend and I stopped in again that weekend.	5	Brew Tea Bar	5
"I. LOVE. EARL. OF. SANDWICH.

Omg. I think about coming here at least once when I'm in Vegas, even when I am staying with a friend who lives off the strip. I was so happy when I found out that I was staying at Planet Hollywood Westgate during my most recent trip to Vegas. I could just walk down and get it! I had it twice that weekend. I wish I went for a third time. The sandwiches are really cheap ($6.99). I'd take it over Pink's hotdogs right outside any day.

I always get the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Sandwich. It reminds me of BBQ Chicken on a Hawaiian Pizza (Pineapple and Ham), but between warm bread. MMM. My friends think it's a really weird combination but I love it. I love it so much that I am afraid of trying their other sandwiches."	5	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
The pho was good and hit the spot after a weekend of partying it up in Vegas, but it left me feeling super thirsty. Must've been the MSG! I got the special, which is number 12, instead of number 1. How odd. Haha. It included rare beef, tripe, beef balls, and tendon. I only spotted about two small pieces of tendon. I enjoyed the beef balls.  Most specials\/dac biet don't include them. My boyfriend strayed from the norm and got their curry noodles, which is a special item. It is a coconut based curry soup with chicken. My boyfriend friend enjoyed it, but I say mama makes it better. ;) I would suggest it if you are feeling like pho but want soup noodles.	3	Pho Aimie	4
"3.5 stars 

I came for a bridal shower. We had a party of 16 and they were kind enough to seat us with 10. The waitress brought our table baguette and butter. The waitress brought us more when we asked! Hooray! The ones brought later were warmer. I couldn't stop filling up on the delicious carbs. 

I got the warm chicken and brie sandwich. It had green apples, caramelized onions and an aioli. The bottom of the sandwich got soggy really quickly. It was alright. It came with some french fries which I didn't even try to finish. They were okay. 

My friend ordered a banana muffin. After one taste, I knew that I had to order one to go. The banana muffin ($3.99) was really good. It was a big muffin, but sort of flat on top. Don't expect very much muffin top, if that's what you're in to. The muffin was moist and the edges were nice and crispy. It did not have any nuts, which is a bummer. There were big chunks of banana in the batter. I would come back just to order the muffin to go."	3	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"Noo don't go is all I have to say. We used to come a lot  from 2013 to the beginning of last year. We just came back today expecting everything to be amazing and the  same. And it was so bad. I got one of my favorites, the chicken caprese sandwich and I regretted it. It was so dry, I had to ask for more vinaigrette to make it
Edible. I was so disappointed.  And to top it they upped everything a dollar or two."	1	Courtyard Cafe	3
Nooo. Was so excited to recieve our order and it was well below average.  The pizza has no flavor to it and the sandwiches are ok but ehh still. Lastly the beer battered combination was what I was looking forward to and yeah again no flavor and the batter came off very easily. Disappointed..	1	Streets of New York	3.5
Really awesome place! Around my neighborhood, actual walked here. It is definitely worth the drive if you aren't close by though. The fried mushrooms and mini fried donuts are pretty awesome. The burgers though, wow just wow.I got the Rambo burger which is a burger with pulled pork and wait for it.. Cheese in the burger. It was as amazing as it sounds..better.Don't hesitate coming here!	5	Rambo's Kitchen	3.5
"My and my buddies stayed here only cuz of the cheaper prices compared to the other hotels off the strip, especially cuz it was so last minute. 

the service is mediocre, the pool seems decent. the room is just like any other average room for that price, nothing special.

would have been great to have a fridge in the room, but i had to use the ice bucket and refill it so often.

the casino area is pretty small and there aren't many tables. the only downside is that the wait to check in takes a while.

overall i'd go here again if it was something last minute, i'd prefer something closer to the nicer night clubs though."	3	Riviera Hotel & Casino	2.5
"Damn the food here is disgusting. After a night out of drinking and clubbin at XS...

This was the closest spot open at TI. Opted to come here cuz they served ""breakfast food"" that was crap. It took forever to get seated even though there were plenty of tables. The server took days to get some water and get the orders down.

Then, the burger i got was dry and not fresh at all. Made me wanna yack ... along with 3 other dudes about 30 mins later. The omelettes look dry and chewy. 

I can see why they're connected with the Pho place next door, no wonder both their service sucks, and so does their food."	1	The Coffee Shop	2.5
"First of all: this place was all hyped up with EDC weekend in vegas a few weeks ago. The line was balls-out nuts insane and looked around the escalators. I couldnt even tell where the end of the line was with so many people crammed up in line with bouncers trying to regular and girls letting their girls cut the line when they arent looking.

After going inside, I was happy to see that its three levels. the Bottom level seemed so dead, why were people even there? I guess for the top 40?

The 2nd level with the huge look around bar was decent. But you have to go all the way or around or squeeze through the crowd near the bar to get to the dance floor area. Then they have this area thats closed off and girls only apparantly: BS. 

you're lucky your drinks are somewhat cheaper than all the other nightclubs. $8 beers and $13 drinks here and there isnt bad at all. with ATB DJing that night, it def made it better. But damn, this place was so damn crowded and it was so hard to get around, it was frustrating.

the place is nice, but not that nice. This would be one of the last nightclubs on my mind if i was to choose between 4 other ones."	3	Tao Nightclub	3
"Damn i've waited forever to come here. Since i arrived in Vegas, i didnt even have a chance to come here until my last day on the strip. The line was huge, but it moves faster than any other line i've seen at a fast food place let alone a sandwich place.

this place is always crowded around the clock and for those prices for a delicious sandwich, this place is legit. 

i had the hawaiian, with no pineapple (yeah i must be crazy right?) and it still hit the spot. come to think of it, i should've gotten the pineapple! also got the full montague and that was ON POINT! i wasn't even drunk and it was awesome, imagine if i was! 

the service is fast, iced tea was great, and people were nice too. i wish they had more seating now, but i can understand how hard it'd be to have the place clean. thanks earl, you're like a god now"	5	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"Hakkasan - you can try to be the top dog of vegas clubs all you want but you've been slacking. 

The set up just BLOWS. One main stage with everything surrounding it. unless you have the luxury of a table \/ bottle service, good luck finding a place to sit ladies! 

The ""dance floor"" always gets crowded - oh and the ladies here have not been poppin either. 

I say stick with XS and surrender if you wanna have a great time."	2	Hakkasan Nightclub	2.5
"damn this place is in a hotel? this spot needs their own location on the strip somewhere and they'll def get good business esp at those prices! 

the loco moco i had was really good and it was sooooo much food for $6. i was tempted to get the tuna too but damn that was so much food. def a clean and nice place to grab lunch on a hot day in vegas. keep it up!"	4	Aloha Specialties	4
"HIDE YA KIDS, HIDE YA WIFE, cuz they rapin' errrbody out here... with these ridiculous prices!

Being hungover and wanting some pho like I usually do after getting drunk, their food is not bad at all, but $15?! that's like three bowls of pho

Aside the decent food, their service sucks. Service is slow. It takes forever to be seated. Water is never refilled."	2	Pho Vietnamese Cuisine	2.5
"A long wait just like any other Denny's i've been too. an even longer wait to get your food too. portions are decent, enough to fill you up. I got some scramble thing they sound really good at that moment after a night out of getting F--ked up at TAO nightclub. 

A lot of people come here to eat and its actually a pretty small dennys, sadly. also, people, no alcohol is allowed here [ my buddies didnt get the memo since we all walked in with a cup filled with something ]. our server betty i believe was really nice. she was awesome with the service, that made up for the wait time for our food."	3	Denny's	2.5
Made reservations to watch the super bowl game here. Food was great and staff was also great. Had the back room all to ourselves. Only complaint would be that the loud speakers went out during the game but not a big deal since you could hear the sound from the television. Would highly recommend.	5	All-American Bar & Grille	3
"The best shawarma in town!!!
The food is authentic, fresh and crazy good! and of course the owner Moshe the nicest guy ever takin care of everything you need with huge generosity
Highly recommend!!!"	5	Shawarma Vegas	4

"We had a work party in the e sports area. The staff were extremely helpful and so easy to work with in planning and when we arrived. The place was festive and most importantly the food and drink was good and plentiful.

Our average age is 40 and everyone had a blast. Some people were playing games for the first time and the staff made sure they learned how to use the controls in a fun and patient way.

We had a last minute conflict so our numbers were suddenly fewer than expected but they worked with us and we were very happy with how the party turned out.

We will return!"	5	GameWorks	3
"I'm not going to fall in line here with the 5 star treatment for Del Frisco's.  Sorry.
 
I've had a lot of great steaks, and while the 16 ounce prime strip that I ate half of was excellent, it just wasn't one of the best Ive ever had.  Del Frisco's seasoning is quite overpowering if you aren't ready for it, and by overpowering I mean--SALTYCALAFRAGILISTICEXPIALISALTY!  

I tasted all 6 steaks that were served to our table, and all of them were similarly over-salted.  I understand that places like this have their ""style"", and perhaps this is just the way they serve meat. However, for a person who usually gets annoyed with incessant ""Mny dnish nis tnoo snalty"" type people to get salted-out by his chunk of meat, there must be some salt in that mofo!

Four stars are because the service here was awesome.  Our waiter was very nice, and extremely gracious.  He even hesitated to politely inform us that we forgot to tip him on a $600 tab (we assumed the gratuity was already added...our bad).  Piano man with the drum machine and crazy falsetto was off the hook (he even rocks the synthesized horn section... very chic). He whipped out a smooth jazzy version of Ray Charles's ""You Don't Know Me""  upon request without batting an eye.  And the MF'n place gives you all the free golf tees and jelly beans that you can carry!!  Damn, I almost wanted to give it five stars just for that! (big golfer here, not so big on jelly beans, but the lady is)

Oh, and the lemon cake was bomb. 

4 estrellas."	4	Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House	4.5
Had amazing meal. The filet mignon nachos were to die for.  Had a great happy hour and Dean gave awesome service. Def a great time.	5	Nacho Daddy Henderson	3.5
"I have tried a couple of AYCE KBBQ places in Las Vegas and this one is my favorite!
They have the largest AYCE menu and wonderful service. The staff is always extremely attentive. 
All the sides are delicious and their bean paste soup is large with a lot of meat. 
Very satisfied!"	5	Jin Mee Korean BBQ Restaurant	3.5
I love this place and crave it ALL the time!!! Shrimp in the Hot N Juicy special sauce mild is my all time favorite with a dozen of cajun sausage, but everything else on the menu is very good. Get there early if you are interested in Crab or Lobster because they sell out quickly. One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!	5	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
"This place is awful... 
Lucky for the owner that it is on Las Vegas Blvd and looks happening and good... because otherwise they would have no customers. The food is overpriced, not good at all and the service is even worse (rude!!!!!!!).  I unfortunately ate here twice and my experience only got worse from the first time. Would never come here again! Save your money and eat at Taco Bell instead!"	1	Cabo Wabo Cantina	3.5
Best burgers in Las Vegas! I was never a fan of the idea of paying a lot of money for something I can get at In-N-Out for 5$. However, these burgers are truly different and absolutely delicious. Appetizers are great too. Shakes are delicious. One little problem with the place is rude hosts. Every time I come I am surprised by just how rude they are- really talk down to people. Aside from that 2 minute expericence, this place is truly worth trying.	4	Holsteins Shakes and Buns	4
"When it comes to Vegas, always remember: You get what you pay for. 

MGM has recently done renovations, and the rooms and hallways look great. They are very much up to ""Vegas standards"". 

However, MGM was originally opened in 1993, so some items that aren't cosmetic haven't been upgraded:

1) Such as the ventilation in the casino and rooms. MGM is very smokey and you will notice it in your hair\/clothing. Also, the AC in our room took a LONG time to cool the room down. 

2) The shower was a little wonky as well. The faucet would run while the shower was running, and the water had the potential to get extremely hot.  

PMGM is cheaper than other hotels, so it's a good choice for someone on a budget who would still like to be on the strip. 

What I did like: 

 1) Having an M Life card. It's free to sign up and allowed us to get a discount on Zumanity tickets. (The price dropped from $115 to $75\/person!) 
A lot of hotels don't offer discounts to their guests when booking through the concierge, so that was great. 
This card also gives you a discount at the small convenient store in the lobby. 

2) The pool area is very nice. There is more than one pool available and extras like a volleyball net and inner tubes are available for free. The chairs are comfortable and there are lots available. 

3) The cafeteria. Dining on a budget? McDonald's and Nathans are some of the fast food available. They also have a Starbucks in the casino. 

4) MGM is located on a busy part of the strip. There are lots of shops and other hotels to walk to from MGM. 

Overall, a nice hotel worth 3.5 stars."	3	MGM Grand Hotel	3
"Delicious! 

This pizza is great! Light crust, slightly spicy sausage, yummy pepperoni and just enough grease. 

Yes, the line is long but does move quickly. For the price, it is almost worth buying a whole box and saving some for the next day. You can call in your order, which helps you skip the line! 

A definite must for anyone who has had *too* much fun at Marquee."	5	Secret Pizza	4
"We were going to do a Tough Mudder the next day, so we wanted to load up on carbs. Italian seemed the way to go, and it was in the MGM where we were staying.  I called up that day and asked for a 6:30 reservation. When I changed it to 7 a few hours later, the hostesses were accommodating as well. 
It was a little family get together celebrating my daughter's fifth birthday early.  We mentioned it to both the hostess and our server (Gabriel from Dayton NV). 

Ambiance:  Dark wood \/ dim lighting\/ modern but had warmth.   People were dressed  both to the nines and also casual formal (like a country club vibe)

Drinks: I tasted The pear martini. And it was delicious! Not too sweet, strong and smooth.

Appetizers:  We ordered the calamari which had plenty of tentacles (love) and some fried zukes too. It was served with a garlicky lemon aioli sauce which was yummy! 
Then a little complimentary appetizer showed up.  Pita bread, olive, artichokes, cheese and Italian meat platter.  What a nice surprise for my daughter!  How nice!

Soup: I ordered a potato leek soup.  Creamy and I can taste both the potato and the leeks.  There were fried mozzarella balls in them. Overall, it was good but a tad heavy for me.

Entrees:  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, the parents ordered the raviolini.  My husband ordered the meat lasagna and my daughter ordered a chicken dish.  There were no children at the restaurant so, they did not have a children's menu.  They said the kitchen usually had an option for pasta.  But, our server, Gabriel asked and they decided to make her a rosemary chicken breast, mashed potatoes and a wine reduction (on the side).  Again** How thoughtful!  She would have accepted the pasta just fine but this made her feel super special.

Anyways, the chicken plate came out first, and then we waited for a while for our entrees to come out.  It was actually a long time.  Gabriel came to apologize for the delay.  I joked to the family that maybe our food got dropped\/they had to run to the store to pick u some extra lasagna sheets or they had lost our ticket.  But then the managers came out to apologize as well.  After about 45 minutes of waiting, the managers brought out all of foods.

It was well worth the wait!
I'm unsure of the lasagna or the raviolini (although everyone raved about it)
but my lobster gnocchi was perfect! Soft and pillowy and lightly creamy!
While the adults were eating our entrees, they came out with a cupcake for my daughter and we quietly sang her happy birthday.  (Quietly, because this wasn't applebees or anything!)

When we finished, our tables got cleared and we were waiting for our check. But instead, Gabriel showed up with four glasses of dessert wine and my daughter got a special drink as well with cherries in the same glass as ours.  She felt like such a grown up!
While we were enjoying our little treat, Gabriel showed up again with a tri of desserts!
Crème Brulee (so delicious and creamy! A cheesecake with a marscapone whipped cream and a chocolate mouse cake with another candle to sing to my daughter!!    What did we do to deserve this besides waiting for our entrée??  

My daughter's eyes lit up and she said she felt like a princess.  We all pretty much did.  We don't go out to fancy places very often and this was such a wonderful time and meant a lot to our family.   I knew the food was going to be super, but I wasn't too sure about the service since I had read the negative reviews.  I'm so happy this wasn't the case at all!

Everything was wonderful!  I hope to be back again soon"	5	Fiamma Italian Kitchen	4
This place is the best. The staff is awesome really funny and friendly. The food is delicious. I totally recommend the general tso's chicken. The prices are fair and reasonable!	5	Bobo China	4.5
"i will never go back to this place! 

At first its deceiving, the place actually looks good and classy but oh my the food taste all the same  = blunt!  TASTELESS! Me and my other 3 girlsfriends ordered different meal plus calamari appetizer and we all end up asking for a box because we all didnt like our foods. 

Service? so so... not bad not too great. 

one star for the ambience , thats it!"	1	Grape Street	3.5

I grew up eating here and man I wish this place was half as good as it used to be 15 years ago!! used to be my favorite,  I would say taste has gone down hill and custom orders arent as fun as it used to be, still cheap and quality double cheesburger under 5$? not really a thing these days so they win there, plus fun place and Secret menu is cool, you cant call to complain thou, however they will route you to there caliornia office and there customer servise and mission statement as a company is excellent, they gave me a card for any burger fries and a shake and a personall letter, to bad there crap employees make sure to let you know that is only for things "On the Menu" funny the Burger they keep messing up is a triple Animal Style, oh well... this place used to literally be the best burger stand ....... if u still wanna go make sure to miss this Garbage location theyve screwed me over 5 times, 5 times i got free food card too:)	2	In-N-Out Burger	4
Highly recommended by my friends that frequent this place , was excited to try it and was disappointed . Ordered the filet and it was chared and the waiter didn't explain how the steaks were made and was overly cooked . Returned it and took forever but the waiter was nice and took it off the bill . The sides were amazing the sautéed mushrooms and the cream spinach .	3	SW Steakhouse	4
Amazing food and service ! Great ambiance ! Every time I go to Vegas I make sure to come here . We started with my usual the spicy tuna on the crispy rice . Then the chicken pad Thai noodles and the shrimp friend rice and then two special sushi rolls . And too top it off got the special fortune cookie. Def recommend coming here !	5	TAO Asian Bistro	3.5
Be aware that your credit card will be charged twice for whatever dining at Picasso costs you. I was told that this is their standard policy when I called to inquire about the double charges on our credit card - one for our dinner without tip, the other for our dinner with tip -  and that the first charge would eventually clear.  We had a wonderful meal - no question about that - but the "after taste" of this policy means we will not return to any of the Bellagio properties.  It seems that Picasso views "guests" as untrustworthy.  Besides, looking at our credit card statement gave us a bad case of sticker shock.	2	Picasso	4.5
worst customer service plz hit me up before you even DARE try this out i promise nothing but an Attitude and wrong order and being on hold for more the 3times. i seriously regret ever having a meal from this terrible place. there pizza was thin then ever and cheese slid off before eating and no joke i tired sooooooooooooo hard to just try them out but nope i will never ever try again so plz someone where is there a 24hr pizza delivery place? heres my facebook ill call them with you on the line and show you how much they suck.	1	Monte's Pizza Restaurant	2
Many good courses to be had with the family meal. The seafood was all fresh and prepared well. Dishes were simple and allowed the delicious flavors of the seafood to be front and center. My two favorites were the citrus and star anise salt crusted sea breem served with a citrus olive oil sauce and the crab & langostino rigatone. I don't normally rave about pasta dishes so this had to be exceptional and it was. The wine they offered paired beautifully with each course.  Plenty of food to be shared amongst a large family of 8-10ppl. The only disappointing dish was the rissotto fruitti di mare which came a little under done and did not meet expectations.  I would definitely come again.	4	Costa di Mare	3.5
Enjoyed the experience. Quality food and drinks with a large selection. Equally as important was the fantastic service we received. Highly recommend!	5	Aces & Ales	4
Love this place! Always a great place to sing and chill with friends. They have good selection of different genres from old to current! Highly recommended!	5	Karaoke Q Studio	4.5
"5 stars for the $5 Fat Tire happy hour and the calamari
3 stars for the pizza - it was decent, it hit the spot, but nothing to write home about
2 stars for the t shirts - wait staff wear shirts that have all of these euphemism for breasts. Lame and borderline offensive.  I get it, it's Vegas, but what does this have to do with pizza?  Totally unnecessary. (Edited:  I was informed by the owner after posting the review that the shirts are to raise awareness of breast cancer research.  ok)"	3	Slice of Vegas	3.5
Excellent Vietnamese food in Chinatown! Took Uber here from the strip to get away from all the horrible food and was rewarded nicely.	4	Viet Noodle Bar	4.5
"My boyfriend took me here for our 1-year anniversary, and it was fantastic.  We both love steak and were staying at the Mirage, which made getting dressed up to go out very easy!

We knew it would be pricey, but I know for the perfect steak it is worth the price.  For every steakhouse I base my review on the cut of steak they started with, and how it is cooked.  Some places start out with a bad cut of meat and still cook it right, and other places have a beautiful slab of meat that they absolutely destroy.  And depending on the repuation of a place, I will order the rareness of my steak differently.  

When we had dinner at Stack, I took the risk and ordered my ribeye steak medium.  It was called the Tomahawk steak with the bone in. When it came to the table, I was floored... it was a beautiful thick-cut ribeye still attached to the full bone, which extended impressively off the plate about 12"" or more!  The presentation alone was magnificent.  And then the taste was spot on... they used a type of herbed butter, but it did not take away from the taste at all.  It was a perfect medium, not too rare and not overcooked.  It is places like this that make me want a steak dinner every day! 

My boyfriend ordered the fillet... and it was perfectly tender.... almost like butter! I am so glad he shared a bite with me.

We also shared the asparagus with truffle hollandaise which complemented the steak perfectly.

To finish it all off, we had the creme brulee with cherries... it was fantastic! Again, the presentation was so fanciful, as it came in a thin swirly dish in the shape of a slender ""S.""  

They have a decent wine menu and are a must-go steakhouse for whenever we return to Vegas!"	5	Stack Restaurant & Bar	4
It has been a long time since I had such great pasta from a chain restaurant.  I was prepared to order a pizza until I saw a garlic pasta with the option of shrimp, chicken or mushrooms added... they allowed me to add all three and it was excellent! The shrimp were markedly delicious... which I did not expect from a pizza establishment!  The added bonus was the proximity of the large screens at the betting booths nearby that were featuring the Spurs game while we ate.	5	California Pizza Kitchen	4
"As a patron of the Mirage Hotel, our vacation group frequented the Cravings Buffet nearly every morning of our stay. 

This is one of the best breakfast buffets I have ever experienced. They have the treasured smoked ham that I always seek out when I am in Vegas.  They even had portuguese sausage the first day we were there!

I really did a disservice to myself by not walking around to all the sections of the breakfast buffet before picking something to eat; finally on the third breakfast there, my boyfriend took me by the hand and we walked the entire buffet.  They have a meats and cheeses section that reminds me of a traditional european breakfast (one of my favorites!), fruit, an omelette\/egg bar, cereal, breads, waffles bar, pancakes, breakfast sausage, bacon, and even featured biscuits and gravy!  The gravy for the biscuits and gravy was a bit on the sweet side for me, but you could tell it was quality and had the right consistency.  Each morning they featured something different. 

The omelettes were one of my favorites... The chef perfectly prepared the omelettes so they not only look beautiful but the cheese is perfectly melted within the omelette.

I love the variety and the freshness of this buffet and will keep coming back!"	4	Cravings Buffet	3
If you can arrange for transportation off the strip, Ellis Island Cafe and the Casino are well worth your visit! They have deals for people who initiate a player's card so that you can get something like $5-10 off a full rack of ribs meal. The ribs were fantastic too! I also love how I could have spent all day at the nickle video poker machines with my $5... nice and easy gambling is much more my style.  So why pay $30 for the breakfast buffet when you can come over a couple blocks and enjoy a nice and large lunch for way less? Best value for your buck in Vegas.	5	Village Pub and Cafe	3.5
"BLT Burger is such a great restaurant, my boyfriend and I ate there twice in our five-day vacation in Vegas!  It is located in the Mirage, and I am sure we will be back!

I was glad our server recommended the Patty Melt Burger from their daily special menu... it was a burger beef patty with apple wood smoked bacon, swiss cheese melted perfectly, their BLT sauce, all between two pieces of thick cut rye bread.  And I just love a burger place that asks me how I would like my burger, to which I responded medium, and that is exactly what the server recommended.

It was a perfect, melty, juicy burger.  I am confident everything on their menu has to be fantastic.  My boyfriend had the original burger, and enjoyed his.  We shared a hard milkshake which was AMAZING. It was called the ""Night Rider,"" chocolate milkshake with oreo cookie crumbles and kaluha.  The shake alone was so amazing that I came back the next day and ordered one to-go from their convenient to-go counter.  Although I think you get more of the shake if you dine-in, I thoroughly appreciated the portability.

The other occasion we came to BLTs, I ordered a Wagyu beef burger... it was like eating a steak it was so good.  I ordered it with cheddar cheese and it was wonderful.  

They also offer deep fried oreos on the menu... didn't get a chance to try them! I also like the clever saying on the waiters'\/waitresses' shirts that said ""Tip Waiters not Cows.""  Great service and awesome food."	5	BLT Burger	3.5
We often frequent the Mirage in our trips to Vegas, and traditionally at least one meal is partaken at the Carnegie Deli.  I love the NY Deli decor, service is great, and this last time we stayed at the Mirage, our Carnegie Deli breakfast was comp'd!  This time I tried the frankfurter breakfast, and it was AMAZING. I have not had a frankfurter like this since the last time I traveled to Germany!  The bagels are great, and rustically toasted on the grill.  It can get busy at times, but even with a long line, they usually are able to seat people relatively quickly.  Their sandwiches are HUGE and can easily be split with multiple people.  I like the high quality ingredients here and it will keep us coming back for more!	5	Carnegie	3
"As an out-of-towner, I really appreciated the down-to-earth atmosphere at Putter's.  My great uncle took me here and it was clear that he has been here often with the VIP treatment we received.  

And as my uncle had mentioned months earlier, they do have fantastic wings.  You can order them ""charred,"" and they make up the wings, and then finish them off with a searing on the grill.  It makes for the most moist, and crispy outside wing that you have ever tasted.  They come in teriyaki and original buffalo, and we had two bowls of about 40 wings for the 4 of us.  

Their salads are HUGE.  From the house salad to the chef salad, they are impressive.  The clam chowder, as the soup of the day, was excellent too.

The beer and drink prices are normal here compared to the strip.  You would need a taxi or other car to get there if you are staying at the strip, but it is a nice change from the overpriced drinks and hit-or-miss food choices on the strip.

So now I can officially say Putter's is my favorite wings place in Las Vegas!"	5	Putter's Bar & Grill	3.5
"Came here with friends who have actually waited in the long lines of the LA Pink's Hot Dogs to eat, so had to try it.

First, let me say that I love hotdogs.  And this place serves so many topping combinations it is amazing.  But when you start with an awesome dog to begin with, you really can't go wrong.  The buns were great, and the hotdogs are awesome.  

Can't wait to come back and try more dogs from their wide variety menu.  The fries were a perfect breaded-crispy that I like too.  Also, they seem to be one of the few establishments that serve Dr. Pepper on the strip, which my boyfriend and I fully appreciated."	5	Pink's Hot Dogs	3
Portion sizes are massive! The two of us shared a rack of ribs for $22 with fries and salad. The meat fell off the bone and was really tender.	4	The Peppermill Restaurant & Fireside Lounge	4
Delicious! Great service, two people spent about $150 with drinks and we were stuffed. Sashimi is soaked in a delicious sauce, the taquito\/taco are a crispy treat to start with and the coconut rice is a must.	5	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
Big portions, lots of flavour. Options include raw meat, applies, soups, rice and noodles. The spicy chicken with lemon sauce is a must.	4	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5
"Horrible service. The first time we ordered delivery from Joey's our food arrived on time and was very tasty. Pizza was excellent. We felt we had found our new pizza joint after just moving to this side of town. 

The next time we ordered, we waited over an hour to be notified that they were ""out of pizza."" Waitwaitwait. Lemme get this straight. Joey's Pizza...is out...of pizza?? K.

Tonight we decided to give them another shot. Hopefully they've restocked. This time we were told, ""Oh, you're going to have to find someone else, we don't deliver that far."" *click* That far?? Call me unreasonable, but after double checking on Google Maps, we live 2.77 miles away...not to mention they'd delivered to us before! What gives Joey's?!

We loved the food, but after these two lame experiences we're kinda just over it."	1	Joey's Pizza	3.5

The food was great, huge portions.  We couldn't finish our plates.  The presentation was excellent complete with sage and twigs.  The service was great, Robert P. was very helpful with the menu.  Seeing that Man Vs Food and the New York Times liked the Sage Chicken, I had to give it a try, and it didn't dissapoint.  They also have a great wall of fame at the entrance.	5	Hash House A Go Go	4
We've been coming here for years.  From the first visit they've treated us with great service, very friendly.  They have awesome Korean dishes with generous sides.  They recently renovated and expanded the restaurant to hold more patrons.  If you love Korean food, this place is a must.  It's also a family owned business, and they take pride in what they do.  You can tell by the quality of their food.	5	Island Style Restaurant	4.5
The service was friendly, the food was great, and the atmosphere is just right for a date night.  No complaints from me.  If you come to Sam's Town, try Billy Bob's.	5	Billy Bob's Steakhouse	3
This place can get really busy, but the service is usually fast and friendly.  They have daily specials and their coffee is good.  The menu is extensive from breakfast to lunch selections, American to South of the border.  If you're in the area, it's a place you may want to try.  Also, their name has changed to The Blue Skillet.	4	The Blue Skillet	3.5
"Finding this restaurant was like finding a hidden gem.  The thing with Vegas is it's either really expensive, or really cheap, with not a whole lot in between on the strip. Trattoria Reggiano was the one place I found that was neither.

It's a very little restaurant tucked between the food court and the shopping in the Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian.  There are maybe 10 or 12 tables total.  It serves what I call Italian comfort food.  Generous pasta dishes and hearty bread served just like a neighborhood Italian restaurant in Anytown, USA.

It was $40 for two of us to eat.  We had Linguini Alfredo and Shrimp Scampi.  Both were tasty and filling.  The service was polite and non intrusive.  No back waiters, no captains, none of that; just a guy who might own the place who's happy to feed you whatever you want, and then leave you be to eat it until you want him next.

Two thumbs up for casual Italian with no fuss!"	4	Trattoria Reggiano	4
"Four of us went for dinner on a Wednesday night. This brief review is for the restaurant only.

The service was excellent. The wait staff was attentive, polished, knowledgeable, and importantly, flexible when we had to order off-menu a bit.

The food was enjoyed by everybody.  The chicken parm was a generous, tasty portion. The four cheese ravioli was hand made and big and delicious. The noodles in the pasta were fresh.

The only negative was the hostess was overwhelmed and young, but I kept on top of her and got our table within a few minutes of our 7:45pm reservation.

The check totalled about $120 for four."	4	LAVO Italian Restaurant & Lounge	3.5
"During my recent visit to downtown Las Vegas, I got a hankering for a quality slab of protein paired with a robust red wine. No surprise there! I became a bit discouraged as I perused the plethora of reviews on Yelp describing several high-end steak houses downtown that are highly rated but also very expensive. Then I found Redwood Bar & Grill located in the California Hotel & Casino. My fellow Yelpers swooned over the quality fare and reasonable prices. So off I went with a colleague in tow.

Upon entry, I knew Yelp had steered me to a good choice. What a classic! Dark wood, nice lighting, and that wonderful steakhouse aroma I love so much greeted us as we walked through the door. Although we had no reservation we were seated immediately (it was a Tuesday night in January after all). 

One or two reviewers remarked on the generous pour cocktails. This was confirmed with my colleague's Jack and Coke and my Tom Collins.

(Whaaaat? Tom Collins??? I have to explain this. My wife and I watched Meet the Fockers the day before I left. Jack Burns loves his Tom Collins and I remarked to my wife that I had never tried one, but I would soon. Waitress at Redwood offers up a cocktail, seemed like the perfect opportunity, so I gave it a whirl. I didn't care for it.)

The menu offers a nice variety of meat and seafood options. A decent bottle of wine will cost a reasonable $35 or so depending on your choice. Most wines by the glass were priced at $8 to $10.

Given that we were both after beef, we were torn between the 16-ounce bone-in ribeye, the ""small"" 16-ounce prime rib, and the 18-ounce porterhouse special. I had the prime rib and my colleague had the porterhouse. If the prime rib cut was 16 ounces I'll eat my hat - it had to be at least 20. And it was one of the leanest cuts of prime rib I have ever eaten.  Served at perfect medium rare temperature along with green beans, rice pilaf, and fresh horseradish it was a bargain at $23.

All said and done, we enjoyed a splendid meal, great service, and a fine atmosphere for a total of about $84 including our meals, 3 cocktails, a glass of Kunde red zinfandel and a nice tip. Absolutely outstanding.

Thank you Yelpers! If it weren't for you I would never have found Redwood."	5	Redwood Bar and Grill	4
"In selecting Rose. Rabbit. Lie. for our first business dinner of the week, our host described this as a funky, strange, incredible experience which, by the way, includes some mighty fine fare. OK, then, sign me up!

We began our evening in the bar, which has a cool speakeasy feel to it. There is a room in the back with a couch along its three walls and heavy drapes that can be pulled closed for privacy. My glass of champagne was the perfect beginning to our very nice evening.

The hostess escorted us into the dining room. I was struck by the ambience - funky (in a very good way) is certainly an accurate description. The live music was a very nice touch, although the noise level overall made conversation quite difficult. We were told that there are ""acts"" that roam the restaurant and entertain guests table side. Our host was surprised and a somewhat disappointed that this did not occur during our visit.

For appetizers our host selected oysters on the half shell, heirloom tomatoes, and Wagyu steak tartare. I don't do oysters; it's a texture thing for me. However, my colleagues trumpeted their deliciousness as they tried to persuade me to try one. No dice. The heirloom tomatoes accompanied with a whipped straciatella cheese, basil and a honey vinaigrette dressing were very flavorful and easily took top prize in my book. The Wagyu steak tartare was outstanding also, and I found the pairing with the heirloom tomatoes to suit me perfectly.

Our host also selected three dinner entrees for our group. RRL is known for its Beef Wellington. Oh. My. Gosh. It was perfect. Fork tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, it was easily my favorite entree of the three. I'd go back again just for this. Hitting the major protein groups, our host also selected the Roast Chicken and Sole Meuniere. The chicken was OK - it's chicken - but the gnocchi served with it were delectable. And the sole, served with an almond brown butter and caviar was an amazing combination of flavors that caused my taste buds to dance a polka. I would go back for this as well.

Dessert selections included Bananas Foster, cooked flambe table side. The banana bread was amazing as was the sauce; some of the best BF I've had. But my favorite, and most unique dessert was the Chocolate Terrarium - yes, a terrarium. Served on a round wooden platter, this dessert offers a selection of fine chocolate goodness including chocolate pudding, chocolate buttermilk cake, puffed wild rice, crispy chocolate tuille, and hazelnut ice cream, all artfully positioned on a bed of chocolate ""soil"" which reminded me of crushed Oreos. The presentation was artful, and for this chocolate lover, the flavors were the perfect rounding out of a very nice meal.

I'm not a gambler, but experiences like Rose. Rabbit. Lie make me appreciate the opportunities to visit Las Vegas. Very nice!"	4	Rose. Rabbit. Lie	4
"This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I'm not ashamed to say I've had every item on the menu multiple times."" With that introduction, our host for dinner yesterday evening kicked off an amazing dinner experience.

The ambience is really cool featuring relaxing lighting and a quiet atmosphere very conducive to dinner conversation. Our host selected a variety of appetizers with which to whet our palates. My favorite was the Wagyu Beef Tartare, succulently flavored and deliciously rich. A close second was the Roasted Veal Sweetbreads - in all my years of dining in many fine restaurants, this was my first sampling of sweetbread. Oh, my goodness, it was outstanding! Our third appetizer was the Fois Gras Brulee, served with a strawberry compote. Don't let the fact that this was my third favorite of three mislead you - this was delicious in its own right but for my palate the beef tartare carried the day.

For entrees, the Maine Bay Scallops with braised oxtail came highly recommended; our host and one of my coworkers selected this. I love scallops but I couldn't get past the roasted venison loin. Served a perfect medium rare, it was wonderfully flavored and I was very pleased with my selection. Another coworker chose the beef short rib and reported it delicous as well. As for the scallops, our host was kind enough to transfer one of his to my plate in exchange for a sampling of venison. The scallop was delicious, but I was pleased with my selection.

For dessert I went exotic again and ordered the Foie Gras Candy Bar - salt & pepper peanut butter cream covered in milk chocolate and served with an amazing bourbon caramel sauce. Holy Sweet Tooth, Batman, we have a winner! And it complimented my post-dinner B&B very nicely.

Like the fare, the service was first class. Wine and water glasses were kept full and the servers were appropriately attentive without hovering.

Sage earned a no-brainer five-star rating from me. ""This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas."" Indeed, I can see why!"	5	Sage	4
"After seating myself at the bar and taking my first sip of Bud Light, I logged onto Yelp and was disappointed to see all of the unfavorable reviews of this place. But, since there are limited dining options in Terminal D, I decided to stay. And I'm glad I did.

Several of the prior reviewers were disappointed in the service. The bartender today was about as cheerful and attentive as one could ask for. He seemed to genuinely enjoy interacting with all the people passing through to their various destinations.

Given that this is a Burke establishment, I ordered a bit out of the box for me - the prosciutto and arugula pizza. In one word: outstanding. Paired with a 9-ounce pour of BV Cabernet, I was in gastric heaven.

While, as other reviewers noted, this is a bit pricey, it is an airport after all. My pizza was $13.99 but would easily feed two adults. Drink prices were a bit steep, but I've come to expect that in airports.

I would do it again. And I probably will."	4	Burke in the Box	2
"I enjoyed breakfast at Citizens during my recent visit to Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. A Thursday morning, I was seated right away and promptly greeted by my server. My coffee came quickly, but unfortunately I had to ask several times for a refill - a huge pet peeve.

I selected the corned beef hash served with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, sans the sauce. I prefer Tobasco. The hash was quite good and the eggs were perfectly prepared. The portion was just right and I left feeling full and satisfied, albeit a tad under-caffienated.

All-in-all I enjoyed my breakfast and would dine here again, but I wish the service had been more attentive."	3	Citizens Kitchen and Bar	3
From a mezzanine overlooking the Four Queens Casino, Magnolia's offers good food around the clock. I enjoyed breakfast here both mornings during my visit. The portions are generous and delicious. With most breakfast combos priced at about $6 to $8 Magnolia's has something for everyone. I enjoyed eggs, corned beef hash, hash brown potatoes, and toast morning one and eggs, bacon, hash browns, bacon, and an English muffin morning two. Breakfast, orange juice, and coffee were about $13 each morning. Along with the good food, the friendly service and prompt coffee refills provided a great start to the day.	4	Magnolia's Veranda	3
"First the gripe: who doesn't have yellow mustard with which to dress a cheeseburger? Joes, that's who. Oh, they have dijon and they have Joes sauce - but the lack of good old, American, yellow mustard is a huge miss for me.

Before anybody shoots me for going to a fine establishment and ordering a cheeseburger, allow me to explain. (1) it was lunch, and (2) I was filling a bit rough around the edges from the night before. The cheeseburger jumped off the menu as the perfect cure for what ailed me. I liked that they cooked it to order. I'm not afraid to order quality ground beef cooked to medium, and that is exactly how it came out. It was a bit messy, however, and I wound up using knife and fork. The fries were crispy and served in a very generous portion. With ketchup.

Joes, please get some mustard. I do look forward to trying you again for dinner."	3	Joes Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab	4.5
"Really enjoy their food !!! I like how parties need to go to the kiosk to reserve their names and receive a text message when you need to stand in line. Overall, the kiosk said it would be a 60 to 75 min wait, in reality it probably took about 40 mins which isn't that bad. 

They have an extremely wide selection of food, we must have been there for almost the 2hrs allotted. 

I would recommend anyone to go here."	5	Bacchanal Buffet	4
This place is awesome when here tonight the food was great service was great drinks are awesome prices are reasonable best  place downtown I found so far I will be back	5	Triple George Grill	4
"They have great sandwiches and 2 free egg rolls with a yelp check in? Yes please!

My only complaint is that the egg rolls were not up to par. They seemed to have a funny after taste and are not the typical Vietnamese egg rolls I'm used to eating.

I have been to this restaurant twice. The food overall being good with good portion sizes. Prices are on par and very reasonable.

The service was good but I did have to wait a bit for more water."	3	Pho Kinh Do	4

"This was the last spot on our bar crawl and THANK GOD for that because this place sucked. One star goes for the location. 

Like I said, we were here on an organized bar crawl so we were able to bypass what little line there was for a Tuesday. It seemed busy, but that's because unless you had a reserved booth there was NO where to sit. We made the mistake of trying to go outside (as it's right by the fountains) and were turned away because it was VIP area. Except not a soul was out there. Hokay.....

The people with the booth obviously were there to drop money on bottle service, but if that wasn't your cup of tea - skip this place. Trying to get a drink at the bar ended up not even being worth it. After wandering around in hopes of finding a place to chill, having another member of our group getting threatened to get booted for dancing (apparently not in the right area, and that right area was - you guessed it - in the VIP area!) we happily left. 

It's hyped as ultra fancy but even in the dark, it has a very worn out look. I'd be curious what it looks like in the daylight. 

I cannot even imagine standing in line OR paying a cover for this vastly typical Vegas club. Yes, Vegas is expensive and what not but for a Tuesday? Lose the attitude. The three other clubs we went to were much better.Thanks but noooo thanks."	1	Hyde Bellagio	3.5
"I'll start off with the food is pretty good & reasonably priced. Why three stars? How busy it is. Now I'm down for waiting at a busy place as long as they manage their tables well & efficiently. HOWEVER I am NOT down for waiting when I made a freaking reservation. They have two lines when you walk up - patio seating, and everyone else. Yes, even if you have a reservation you're standing in a line to get checked in with people who have no reservations. 

We finally get in to check out and I ask if it's possible to get patio seating (yes my bad for forgetting to ask earlier) and I'm told it's a 90 minute wait for that. Even though when I walked by I saw several empty tables. Oh well, that's fine. As we're waiting (more waiting!) I hear them tell a walk up person it's a 30 minute wait for the patio. What in the hell is the point of a reservation when you can just walk up and wait less time!? At this point I'm ready to stomp out but I'm a) hungry and b) on a schedule to catch a show.

From there, service was fine. I got the hangar steak and it was pretty good, as were the fries. The price point was excellent for the strip as well. But after the crap service to start with, I can't go above three stars."	3	Mon Ami Gabi	4
We live 1.1 miles away from Sushi Twister, which means we eat here constantly. The staff is fantastic and great with children. The price is good and their rolls are great. If you are even considering eating here, you should. I highly suggest the Cowgirl, Japanese Lasagna and red bean ice cream.	5	Sushi Twister	4
I am a really into craft beer and I was in Henderson visiting my mom. She thought it would be really cool to take me to the Yardhouse because they have so many taps and seem to be a fun place. We were seated fairly quickly and our waitress was very nice. But it took about 15 minutes to even get our drink orders. And then we order appetizers and our meal. That took a while as well and the food was definitely nothing to write home about. The calamari and squid were tough and chewy, and the lobster\/crab dip was way to salty! I got the seared ahi sandwich and couldn't even eat half of it, the tuna was dry and overcomes and the dressing was not good. My mom got the baha fish tacos with rice and beans. They were also less than appetizing. Especially for the price! Way overpriced for what you get! I order another beer when our entrees were brought out and it didn't even arrive until we were finished and ready to leave. Yes, this place a great variety of excellent beers, but would definitely not recommend it!	1	Yard House	4
Underwhelming, mediocre food, we ordered 3 appetizers & two alcoholic beverages our check was $95.26. Wayyyy over priced, tacky ambience. They should stick to a simple, traditional concept I felt they were doing too much with the dj and strobe lights. Super disappointed.	1	Chica	4.5
"Miss the OLD management :(
This place is expensive, food is bland and has the WORST customer service!!! I was treated disrespectfully when I requested my food to please be re-made because it came with guacomole. I have a severe allergy. The girl at the drive thru window caught an attitude with me, SNATCHED the bag back through the window INJURING my finger!! I was shocked and livid!! NO LONGER A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!!!"	1	Tacos El Burrito Loco	3.5
Omgosh, I'm getting hungry just thinking about them! The best carne asada tacos and burritos hands down! Fast and hot. Glad their close by lol!	5	Tacos Mexico	3.5
"I originally gave them 5 Stars last year, but their management is atrocious. I attempted to call at 11pm (they closed at midnight & are directly across the street from my apartment complex, literally 2 mins away). They ignored my calls, so at 11:15 I placed an online order. These jokers had the nerve to take my money and NEVER bring my pizzas!! $27.00 worth of food ignored! 

No worries, I'll be calling corporate, getting  my money back."	1	Domino's Pizza	1.5
This has to be the worst place I've called for delivery. I just called and all I said was, "Do you all deliver to my area?" In a thick accent but also a hint of disconnect in this woman's voice, she says slowly, "where do you live again?." I start Sa.....I'm interrupted with, "Oh sorry we don't deliver there". Really????	1	Big Daddy's Pizzeria	2
I live 2 mins from this place, it always has great music playing, its clean, and well managed.	5	Rebel Republic	4
the place looks like a dive but the food is fine and the service friendly.  they basically have pizza, some sides, falafel, and a few other things.  the pizza was good thin-crust style.  the prices are  high.	3	Adar Kosher Pizza	2
we LOVED this restaurant.  It can get crowded, and there may be a wait, but the staff tries very  hard to make it all work.  the food is GREAT. Sushi is fresh, pasta dishes are wonderful, pizza is very good, and all the appetizers are good.  It is about an 8-minute drive from the strip, but when they are not too busy, they can deliver to the hotel as well (which costs about as as much as the cab to get there, so it is worth it).	5	Nina's Cafe	4
"These are the best chicken strips I've ever had. I order the baked strips, grilled veggies and wasabi cream and chili sauce. It's fantastic every single time. Service is quick (which is good since lunch time is crowded). It's a very small place so be prepared to either wait for a table or just order to go. The bakes mac and cheese is also great, especially if you throw some of their buffalo sauce on top! 

You should try BFG, they're great."	5	Strip N Dip Chicken Strips	4.5
"I'm surprised this place has so many sterling reviews. When I walked in the first thing we noticed was all of the dust clinging to the light fixtures, ceiling and walls (especially around light switches). Then we sat with our menus waiting...and waiting...and waiting for our order to be taken. The avocado dip and whole wheat chips was an amazing appetizer, and there the good food ended. Our lunches took over 30 minutes to be brought to us when half the cafe was empty. I stood at the counter trying to get someone's attention when the waiter never came back to check on us or give us more water. The floor in the kitchen is covered in food, especially under their rolling racks, and the counter tops where food is prepared are littered with dirty utensils and pieces of food that fell during prep. My chicken salad sandwich was completely bland and had a weird after taste which was such a surprise after the great avocado dip. I even tried to apply pepper to help and wouldn't you know it, my pepper shaker was completely empty. When the waiter finally came back to ask if we needed anything it had been over an hour since we'd sat down and we asked for the check. 

I'd had really high expectations for this place after reading all the reviews and now I have no idea why anybody wants to go back here. The service is horrible, the entree was less than mediocre and not a single person in that place seemed happy to be there. I wanted to try several things on the menu, but I'm not going back again."	2	Red Velvet Café	3.5
"This is the best Thai food in Vegas. Not only do they listen when I tell them I want it hot, and not white people hot, but they are also quick like bunnies. We can do a full meal and be out of there in under 40 minutes at lunch time. Service is excellent, wait time is minimal (if at all) and their choices are great. I am a panang snob and their's is perfect. 

The best way to judge any cultures food is by the crowd. When you walk into a Thai food place to find it full of asians, you know you're in the right place. Try it."	5	Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant	4
I love this place. The pasta speck is my favorite. Their new white chocolate profiteroles are great. They are fast and deliver in Mountains Edge. We order from them about once a month. We have never eaten in the restaurant and can only attest go the awesome food and homemade deserts.	4	Spaghetty Western	4
After living in Southern California, it's hard to impress me with Mexican food. I'm used to real mexican food, great street tacos, and getting it all cheap. Chicken Itza is better than any other mexican food I've had in Las Vegas because it's real.  The curb appeal of the shopping center is lacking, but my favorite foods always come from dives and holes in the wall. The chicken in the enchiladas was amazing, their green sauce made me tongue happy and their horchata was authentic. We spoke with the owner, and he is delightful. Give Chicken Itza a chance, your taste buds will thank you.	5	Chicken Itza	4.5
"This place used to be great, but has gone down hill. The same rolls are never consistent from chef to chef anymore. They also are very wet and falling apart most of the time. When we had rolls delivered to our table that were different than what we ordered, the waitress argued with us about how ""sushi works"" and that it's an art. I pointed at the menu which clearly defined the items meant to be in our roll and she finally took the wrong order away while rolling her eyes. 

This place used to be great. We'd eat here about every 2 weeks for all you can eat at lunch. My entire office is never going back after the decline in service and food quality over the last few months. I hope you figure it out Sushi Mon, you were the only decent sushi on this side of town for lunch."	2	Sushi Mon	3.5
"I went here with my husband, just after Christmas.  The waiter was chatting with another table, for like 5 minutes at a time, while telling us we needed to order quickly before the kitchen closed (at 3:30PM?)  Considering they have no vegetarian options on the menu, I asked for a salad minus the chicken.  When I asked if they could charge less, since there's no chicken, the waiter said he couldn't ""override the system.""   However, he was fine to add full-priced side salads on for my hubby...  

They did fix my husband's salad, which they'd mistakenly put cheese on (why the waiter didn't check, after hurrying us to order...)   The fries were good...  My salad was fine...  

When four of our family showed up later (after the kitchen had closed) they sat with us, and shared some of my hubby's burger.   

Inattentive, casual service, decent food, weird hours, sodas that are over three bucks each, came out to be over $60!?   Oh yeah, and then they added a gratuity for our party of six, even though they only served two of us (because the kitchen was closed.)   WTF?"	1	Red, White & Blue Restaurant	2.5
As a big fan of Scarpetta both in NYC and Vegas, my friend and I went to sister venue d.o.c.g. for a quick bite before work tonight.  I ordered the trofie with shrimp and roasted tomatoes - when they dropped the plate off, I seriously thought it was a joke.  For $22, I got a 3 1\/2 inch plate of pasta with miniature shrimp.  It looked more like an appetizer than an entree.  Thinking I may have mistakenly ordered an appetizer, I asked the waiter if this was intended as an entree, to which he replied 'yes'.  What a joke and a rip off.  I left there still hungry despite finishing the tiny portion of pasta and two breadsticks.	1	D.O.C.G. Enoteca	3.5
Terrible experience.  We ordered online (on their website) for a pick up order an hour and a half in advance.  Got confirmation and all.  When I arrived, no one had any record of the order, nor any way to figure out what happened.  After three staffers, finally they brought over a manager, whose solution was 'well, we can make your order now, shouldn't be more than 25-30 minutes' - uhhhh.  The solution is to ask me to wait another half hour at the service bar (standing)????  No way will I go back.	1	P.F. Chang's	3.5
Yuck!  I visited this place with a friend after a number of people recommended it to us.  Food was inedible!  We ordered a salad that was wilted and drenched in bottled dressing, pasta puttanesca (which we figured no one could screw up - but lo and behold, they destroyed it), and a veal dish.  We had to send the veal back because it was so tough and chewy, they very graciously took it back to the kitchen, but sent a new one to us that was just as terrible.  We didn't eat hardly anything and then left without even taking the food home as it was that bad.  We couldn't figure out why anyone would recommend it.  I do have to say the service was very good, but that's the only redeeming thing we found about it.	1	Nora's Italian Cuisine	4
Great spot - yes, a chain, but good food and quick!  Ordered an order for pick up and it was ready when I arrived (less than 10 minutes!).  Food was very good as well.	5	Romano's Macaroni Grill	3
"Joe's comes highly recommended by many of my friends, and the pictures of the crab claws looked amazing.  

My experience is that the service was very good, but I like the steak more than I did the claws.  I thought it was a lot of work and it was as good as the Jonah crab that you can get at Bacchanal buffet.  For the price I expected it to be much better.  

The best item I would have to say is the crab bisque, that was definitely memorable.  But I would have to say that there are too many choices to check out in Vegas before I would consider returning."	4	Joes Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab	4.5
the five stars are no joke.  amazing customer service.  amazing ingredients.  amazing boba.  love love love.  AND they have soy milk and almond milk for all of us lactose intolerant folks.  if you're not here yet,  get here!	5	Brew Tea Bar	5
My friend and I had lunch here it was good a bit too pricey for what we ordered but thankfully the food was very good. My friend had the mexico city chicken enchiladas and I had the grilled skirt steak. We also had the chips and salsa the salsa was very good, but the chips and salsa not free like other mexican restaurants. As for the service it was good although our waiter seem to have trouble splitting our bill in half. Overall that place was good I don't think I will eat here again but will for sure get a mango margarita to go!	3	Cañonita	4
I went for breakfast, the service was ok. I honestly expected more from this place. I had the french toast it was good but I think I could off been better. Although I was a bit disappointed with my meal\/experience I think I might give it another try for dinner.	3	Il Fornaio	3.5
Definitely a quick bite place. I think the pizza is very good, one slice get me full. Overall pizza is good and the price very good... Open til 3am =]	4	Sirrico's Pizza	3.5
"I don't know about the other reviews but this place is amazing. Went on a Sunday night and had a blast. Had free shots, danced just a great time.
The bartenders are amazing!!!
The drinks where very good, specially when you ask them to make you something good, they customize you a drink yummy!!
I can't wait to go back."	5	Kahunaville Island Restaurant	3

"Was in LV for the wknd was looking for a place to have dinner that wouldn't cost $$$$ this place was it. I didn't have the Kobe but will next time, instead I customized my burger and it was delicious. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good tasty juicy burger lets not forget the fries and beer. =] Although it took 45mins to get a table it was worth the wait.

**Burger Bar right between Mandalay Bay and Luxor**"	4	Burger Bar	4
Have to agree with some of the other reviewers, there's nothing really special about this place. My husband and I went a few months ago, reservations recommended. The service was good very attentive. We ordered the filet mignon\/sides, mashed potatoes trio, mushroom pot pie, asparagus and creamy spinach. The steaks and sides were good but my hubby still believes it would off been better. If you go get ready to spend some $$$.	3	Rare 120	3
Mediocre brat. Service subpar. Server kristyn doesn't believe in interacting with customers. Smile, "what do you want, here you go, ok"...move on.	2	Beerhaus	4
Great service and good food for a casual cafe setting. The wife and I enjoyed the blue crab fritters and shared a lobster roll. They offered to split the lobster roll which was perfect. Hefeweizen went great with lunch. We'd come back.	4	Society Cafe Encore	4
"Couldn't have been happier with this place! Service was perfect (thanks Mathew!), atmosphere was exciting and warm...and the food ? Wow...

Get the Poutine! It's a must. The octopus was outstanding as were the sea scallops and lamb shepherds pie special. The Guinness went great with the meal. We will definitely be back. Absolutely loved it."	5	Public House	3.5
"I've been looking forward to trying La Cave for awhile now. We made reservations and were seated at our outdoor table at 815pm. The atmosphere inside near the pizza ovens and bar would have been more interesting but the outdoor area was enjoyable. 

Our server explained the menu and special and responded to our questions very well. She was busy with several tables the rest of dinner and could have checked in on us a few more times.

I had the Spanish wine flight but had to ask for a copy of the wine menu again because she didn't explain each of the wines. 

We enjoyed the asparagus with jamon Serrano and egg; those Spanish pigs are tasty. The beets with goat cheese were not as good as I had hoped. The bacon and quail egg flatbread was just ok but filling. The veal short rib pasta was quite good especially with the Spanish red wines on the flight. But the winning tapas of the night was the sea scallops with polenta. You only get two and we could have eaten ten they were so good. 

Overall La Cave was a good place to enjoy tapas and wine on the north strip. But I was not wowed like I am when I eat at Jose Andres restaurants like Jaleo. If I'm anywhere near the central strip and in the mood, I'd rather eat there."	4	La Cave Wine and Food Hideaway	4
"+ open 24 hours!!
+ real close to the strip...less than 5 min drive
+ large restaurant which means lots of tables

food wise -as most have said- isn't anything too impressive..but considering this is VEGAS....i guess its good enough for vegas =)

I really liked my eggroll dish i ordered (the fried eggrolls you wrap w\/ lettece).
pho itself did lack a bit of flavor...

all in all...if you get tired of american\/fusion food...and you're craving some MSG...this would be a decent place to go =)"	3	Pho Little Saigon	2
The Top Chef Tasting Menu is a must!!! Make sure you come hungry because it looks like four courses on the menu, but it is really 12 courses. Amazingly fresh fish flown in almost daily!! You even get to select your fish from a special tank the server wheels table side. House-made pasta!! Daily-spun gelato\/sorbets!! Fantastic dinner!!! We'll be coming back here for sure.	5	Costa di Mare	3.5
Because a friend of mine recommended this place, we thought we'd try it out. First time here with my hubby to check it out as a potential event venue. Mussels marinière and frites were quite good for starters. My husband's Cobb salad was kind of sad looking and the lardons were so hard that they were essentially indelible. My "seafood" crêpe was a crêpe filled with some green peas; this was accompanied by three shrimp and two sea scallops on the side with a cream sauce. One would expect a seafood crêpe to be filled with seafood, not just some sad little peas. Don't think Mon Ami Gabi made the cut for our event. Just meh.	2	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"Over cooked catfish with bad flavor.  Rocks in my yard are softer.  WAYYYY over cooked. This is isnt catfish. Made me sick had to stop eating and throw away.   Ribs were just as bad.  Worst experience in my life.  Orderd from Uber and hope they drop that restaurant.NEVER AGAIN.  I am sick to my stomach from over fried, over cooked food.  Catfish should not be DARK brown and hard as a rock on the inside.  Will call health department if i get food poisining.  For what i paid, should've went to Carls Junior.  Now I nave to go buy a new meal and be out more ,money to feed family,SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS

Oh yeah.....ribs were burnt and couldnt tear off the bone with a saw"	1	Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que	3.5
Great pizza and their delivery staff are really nice and very prompt.  I'm glad they are here.	4	Marco's Pizza	3.5
The food was delicious and the service was courteous, fast, and friendly. An even better bonus: Buddy himself was there that day to film for his show! He stopped by every table to greet everyone, ask how the food was, and to take pictures. The sangria was great, as were the panzanella, meatball sub, and canolis. Not saying this because we met Buddy, as I already formed my opinion on the food before we met him. Great experience, and I would definitely recommend if you're on the strip in Vegas.	5	Buddy V's Ristorante	4
"My friend and I were there this afternoon at 6 PM May 25, 2017 we ordered cranberry pecan chicken salad sandwiches barbecue chips and water
My sandwich was not fresh the bread was stale it had chopped apples no Pecans. They had no barbecue chips even though they were displaying them they only had one salt and vinegar chips and they had no bottled water of any kind. 
The beverage cabinet at the front by the register was completely empty
The only good thing about this meal is I ordered a peanut butter smoothie and that one was fine. 
My friend ordered the same sandwich that I did instead she was delivered and Apple turkey sandwich that was very dry. No chips we had to go after the chips and they had no water and no napkins with our meal or on the table. 
The only beverage they were offering was soda, and smoothies. 
I definitely will never return to this topic and a smoothie's café"	1	Tropical Smoothie Cafe	2
We ate there this afternoon December 8, 2015 I highly recommend the jambalaya with shrimp the fried pickles are very salty they feature a fried chicken with sweet potato waffles are Belgian waffles with shavings of sweet potatoes little disappointing overall I would rate it 3 1\/2 stars was very clean but noisy for an afternoon lunch	3	Salt 'N Pepper Southern Comfort Bar and Grill	2.5
The food is terrible. There's not a lot of selection. It was $28 a person for dinner and I barely ate because it was just gross.	1	The Buffet at Luxor	2.5
First time for lunch at this location and I'm impressed with the friendliness, professionalism and service excellence of the staff. It's difficult to find a great vegan place to eat that doesn't contain salt, oil and sweeteners. They knocked it out of the park here!	5	Greens and Proteins	4
"I loved this place and I simply can't think of a negative thing to say about it.

First off, the menu states that they bring the food out continuously.  Fabulous!  This actually allows you to sit, eat, and talk!

We had two appetizer (lobster egg roll and raw tuna) and two entrees (japanese short ribs and duck).  The tuna was amazing.  It literally just melted on my tongue.  The duck was not overly-fatty but the short ribs stole the show.

Our dinner ran 127 without tip and was absolutely worth the money.  Yum!"	4	Japonais	3.5
"Banana nut muffin, will you marry me?  My husband may object, but that's ok.  We won't tell him.

The wait on a Sunday morning was 25 minutes.  Obviously, it's a good place if people are waiting.  We didn't mind the wait at all.

We shared the stuffed french toast (stuffed with eggs, cheese, bacon) and the collision course (a cross between a crepe and omelet).  Mine came with a banana nut muffin.

My coffee was never empty.

You know the food is good when you are so full and you keep eating.  You know you're going to get sick, but you just don't care."	5	Egg & I	4.5
"Hands down the best buffet in Vegas in my opinion. I absolutely love the huge selection and different types of cuisine and the enormous dessert bar. 

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is for the price. It's creeped up from reasonable to just a tad over the top over the last few years. We usually go for lunch and are able to find a coupon online so the price ends up being about $15, which is more than reasonable, but I don't think the dinner prices are justified. Maybe that's just me speaking as a vegetarian because all of the meat and seafood options are not a draw for me, so with everything included I'm sure it is worth the heftier price tag.

Honestly, when I go to Vegas it has nothing to do with gambling. I stick a quarter or two in a machine and that's it. We go to watch the cover bands play, for the novelty of walking around outside with our drinks, and to hit up the Carnival World Buffet at least once or twice."	4	Carnival World Buffet	3.5
"As with most 2-star restaurants, I don't have too much to say. 

The bagels were ""good"". The corned beef hash was ""good"". Service was ""ok"". Pancakes ""did the job"". There was nothing truly remarkable about this place. 

EXCEPT... the waitress was noteworthy. She was consistently dropping parts of meals! I watched 2 pieces of bacon slide off the plate when she rounded a corner... and proceed to put it on our table! I even had to call her attention to it, and she needed to be reminded that we needed replacements! Later on she dropped someone's bagel basket completely. Now I know everyone has their days, but this lady was not in good form. 

Needless to say, I don't plan on going back. I'd much rather go to the Cracked Egg instead (see my review for it)."	2	The Bagel Cafe	4
"I went with group of 8... 3 sent food back. Sides were nothing special at all. My bone-in NY steak was good, but not as good as I'd expect in a high-end Vegas steakhouse.

Atmosphere was pleasant. Bread was noteworthy. Waiter was helpful. Manager was understanding. Meals were taken off the bill but I won't be back. Not with plenty other fine-dining options nearby."	2	Les Artistes Steakhouse	3.5
"After a night of singing and dancing at New York New York's piano bar, FATBURGER was our next stop. 24 hours of awesome burger deliciousness!!!

Very busy even at 3am... and after the food it was understandable. It might have been all the rum, but the wait seemed to take 20 mins. It was definitely worthwhile. I love to eat. And I love to eat burgers. But man, this one took all my effort. 

Be careful, they only take cash!"	4	Fatburger	3.5
"You wake up some time between 8am and 10am, ready to get your weekend started. You're a Las Vegas resident. You live off the strip. It's time to get some grub. Where do you go? The Cracked Egg is your only thought. 

That's right folks, The Cracked Egg presents hearty, diner-style food at reasonable prices. Sure, you might not have unlimited champagne, bloody mary's or mimosas... but the flavor of the food here can't be beat. 

My party of 4 was thoroughly pleased... I had the special, which was some sort of grilled chicken with spinach and mushrooms and cheese on sourdough bread. The chicken was succulent, not overdone but not underdone. The sourdough was toasty and firm (not soggy from sitting too long). The mushrooms and spinach tasted fresh and coupled with the cheese provided a great flavor\/texture contract. 

My dad had the South Shore omelette... he actually finished everything. That's a good sign for him. 

Other diners had the Carnitas Omelette and Eggs Benedict. 4 thumbs up from them. 

Service was great, never had to ask for more coffee or water. Atmosphere isn't sexy or trend-setting, but comfortable and fitting. The bill was reasonable... about what you'd expect from any diner in the country. I'd definitely go there again!"	4	The Cracked Egg	4
I have never had such amazing service. Moises is so friendly and remembers you everytime you come back! The food is also wonderful and the meat in the pho is so delicious. If you're looking for great pho, you should definitely check this place out. Also their coffee is so delicious.	5	Pho Bosa	4
"This place is in the newish CityCenter complex. My father was born in Wales and it was the first time he'd been to Vegas in years, so we decided to stop by here late one Saturday evening for appetizers and drinks. 

The beer selection is satisfactory. No complaints there. The Tenaya brews are actually local, and it's good to see a big Vegas hotel restaurant supporting a local brewery. My nutty brown had a full flavor, not too bitter but not tasteless. Thumbs up.

The Welsh Rarebit was not good. It didn't sound the most appetizing (it's basically an open-faced grilled cheese) but again, since my dad is from Wales, we decided to go with it. We got what we expected. I think they have it on the menu because it's British. I doubt anyone actually orders it. I wouldn't recommend it. Thumbs down.

The Kelley's Sliders were decent enough. They used juicy prime rib. If we would have stuck with another order or two of these, the experience would have been 4 stars. Thumbs up.

Lobster Poppie was thoroughly confusing. Splitting it 4 ways is NOT the best way to go about this. Now I didn't get the full scoop on its history, but it was basically like a little pot pie with 2 pieces of lobster, way too much bread and some random filling (with corn?). Might have been good if it was only for me, but again we chopped it up and shared. As with most things lobster, there was not enough lobster. Definitely overpriced. Thumbs down.

Shrimp cocktail was disappointing... mostly because at $4.50 a shrimp you'd expect it to be the best in the world. Thumbs down. 

Service was great... our waitress was polite, well informed and even took back a mixed drink that was ordered because my beautiful date didn't like it. Thumbs up. 

Atmosphere is what you'd expect from a Vegas ""PUB"". Trendy. Stylish. Mostly comfortable. They allowed us to be seated right away in the barstool section, near the bar. Thumbs up. 

Overall it was OK... maybe a bit overpriced but if you're going for good beer then I'd recommend it."	3	Todd English P.U.B.	3.5
My party of 5 was not impressed with this place. The service was the main problem, as we felt stuck in a corner with little to no attention. This was on a Sunday morning btw. When the food came out we had to flag the waitress down because we still didn't have any napkins or silverware. My "over medium" eggs were basically hard boiled. Corned beef was good. Toast was GREAT but when my friend asked for jelly that took another 15 mins. They charge you for coffee here which I wasn't used to... every other place gave it complimentary. All in all a bad experience and not going back. A shame because I'm a big fan of THEhotel.	1	THEcafe at THEhotel	3.5
"Great little spot. Bison sliders were a hit and it was definitely enough food to keep a hungry guy happy for at least a few hours. The waitress was cool as hell, and hot to boot. Had the suicide girls thing going on with tats and all. 

We were a party of 7 and our high roller decided to go with the $60 burger. He said it was good but wouldn't get it again. 

Another of our party lit up a cigarette and one of the bus boys came over and pretty rudely told her to put it out. I see where the guy was coming from but the attitude was unnecessary.

Shakes with alcohol were very appealing. Someone at my table got one and said it was delicious so that's something on my list next time I head to vegas."	3	Burger Bar	4
This place is really nice.  the people are friendly and courteous, the casino, a little on the smaller side, the restaurants, well, so so.  However, for a downtown establishment, it's quite nice!	4	Downtown Grand Hotel & Casino, An Ascend Hotel Collection Member	3.5

I just went here for the first time with three friends and the food was amazing! We all opted for AYCE and it was definitely worth it. I've been to several other AYCE places but this one had the best service by far! All of the servers were smiling and were quick to bring the food. I'll definitely be returning.	5	Sushi Koma	4

"I absolutely love this bingo hall. I've won twice, but regardless of how often I win-this is my choice in bingo halls. The ladies at the window are extremely nice and so friendly. They'll crack jokes once you're a regular and they enunciate when the numbers are being called. If you get there early enough you can get your drinks early and not have to wait for the cocktail waitress to come around. Make sure you get a players card before playing so that you get your discount. 

*cash only*."	5	Bingo at South Point	4
A friend and I ate here last Friday and our server Luis was absolutely amazing! He was so friendly and offered so many different suggestions	5	Lindo Michoacan	4
This place is super cute and has a small town coffee shop feel to it. Several people walked in after me and the batista knew their names as well as their orders. I'll definitely be back	5	The Cuppa	4
I don't understand how this place can receive such high ratings. They don't have a liquor license so they can't serve you mimosas which is the whole concept behind their name. We walked in and pretty much had to seat ourselves. The bench wasn't bolted down nor were the tables which seemed strange. The food took forever to order and was bland when it came out. I ordered a protein scramble and had to cover it in tapatío in order to eat it. The home style potatoes looked like they would be flavorful but they left me disappointed. My friend ordered the corn beef hash and said the same thing. The service was alright but it took forever to get our check and even longer for them to pick it up. Now, if a restaurant is busy I am more patient but when there are only 2 tables that are occupied, there is no excuse for poor service. I will never return to this place and would turn anyone away from here.	2	Mimosas Gourmet	4.5
The place had horrible lighting and the place just seemed dingy. The waitress was nice, but we were the only ones in the restaurant which makes me a little weary. The food was overpriced for the quality that you received. I LOVE indian food and this place was way under expectation and my standard. I would never recommend this place to anyone.	2	Mantra Masala	3.5
Excellent excellent tasty food fast service love it reminds me of a ny soul food place Amy Ruth's	5	M&M Soul Food Cafe	3
"Tomato soup was really good. Hot. Creamy. Comforting. I'm not a tomato soup lover but I love this

The full montegue was better than the chicken avocado. Chicken avocado was very standard. Would not get a second time

Next time will try the original or tuna melt. Or just get the full montegue again

No AAA discount like someone mentioned in a previous review"	3	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"This was a nice place for a bite to eat 
Service was great, I had a reservation but we were running late. I called to inform them and was told that was fine. 

Had a wonderful time, with great service and food."	4	D. Vino	3.5
"I'm sorry to give you such a low rating, it started off going great, we got seated right away, our server was courteous and quick to take our order, and the food was great, that is when we finally got it. 
I'm sure something happen to make our breakfast take longer than I'm used to, (now this could be the standard) either case it would've been nice to have been informed about our meals and not left wondering if we were forgotten."	3	MTO Café	4.5
"We were told that this was a good place for breakfast, we visited and was not disappointed, But what I didn't expect was the size of the portion. Wow, huge!!! 
Next time I'll remember. 
See ya when I return to Vegas"	4	Hash House A Go Go	3.5
"The tacos are unquestionably some of the best I've ever had in my life. That is without a doubt. 

The downsides to Tacos El Gordo:
It is one of the worst lines systems in the world. As far as efficiency, it's the worst. Combine that with cramming people on every side, and it really begins to get on your nerves when you're hungry.
Also, as far as me, everyone speaking in a language I don't understand makes things difficult.

With all of that being said.........those al pastor tacos...ask for pina (pineapple), and man are they to die for."	4	Tacos El Gordo	4.5
We can put a monkey in space but the girl this morning at the drive thru can't get an order right...... 15 per hour....not!!!!!	1	McDonald's	2
Sad excuse for a sandwich, hardly any turkey and the wife ordered hot peppers but got onions.... Getting just like McDonald's third time in a row order wrong!!	2	Jimmy John's	3
What can I say? My eight year old son has wanted to go here forever. We finally went for his eighth birthday on Monday. Our waitress was blah, wife was not happy with her at all. The table next to us had the upbeat waitress who made things exciting! Anyway, we ordered our food which consisted of burgers, fries and onion rings, what came out was the driest meat I have ever tasted. Now I know what they do with the used pucks from the Golden Knights hockey practice! The only thing that was half way decent was the onion rings! So after all was said and done,  I had choked my burger down, my son ate half, daughter had one bite and the wife had two bites. I took the uneaten burgers to go and gave them to some fellers outside who were happy for the meal. At least I didn't feel that I wasted eighty bucks on crap! Also they don't even validate parking! If you feel the need to go there, save a few bucks and look at the food on-line and go somewhere else!	2	Heart Attack Grill	3
I've been to this restaurant 2 times and both times were awesome the food is awesome and the staff is great.  Not to mention the interior is slamming so retro looking can't wait to eat there again. If I could give this place more stars I would	5	Siegel's 1941	3
This is the 3rd time I've been  to this restaurant and all of the times the food was awesome and the staff was Reay friendly. I will definitely be going there again.	5	Panda Express	3
Superb service. Fantastic food and ambiance. Be sure to request a kosher steak when making your reservation.	5	SW Steakhouse	4
I had high hopes for this place, but sadly, it was a disappointment. The food was so-and-so, and service was slow despite the place being almost empty. This place is inside the Hard Rock Casino, which is being remodeled. Hopefully, once the remodeling is finished and the restaurant gets more traffic they will shape up, but until then - avoid.	3	Culinary Dropout	4
If you're in Vegas, have a car, and are looking for something better than the hotel breakfast buffets, this is the place to go! Hidden away among strip mall small shops, the café offers awesome wraps and Benedicts at very reasonable prices. Friendly staff and prompt service also. The pancakes were the least good, not to say that they were bad.	5	The Original Sunrise Cafe	4.5
Possibly the best burgers we've ever had, and the parmesan fries with truffle aioli are to die for. There was a wait even though we were here at 4:30 on a Monday, and I can understand why.	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
Drove here right after watching Las Vegas episode of Unique Eats on Cooking Channel. I've tried agedashi tofu from Japan, Korea, Cali, TX and some more in between and had better agedashi tofu but when Raku said it was homemade tofu it was just that, an awesome HOMEMADE agedashi tofu. Snapper collar was crispy almost to the perfection that didn't need any additional seasoning, chicken skewers bursted with charcoal grilled flavors. My fav. chicken with skin skewer.  Although I'm little disappointed that chefs are rushed by customers demands and they can't fully show their potential, definitely will visit again when its less busy.	5	Raku	4.5
10mins wait time on saturday night at 10 pm but two orders of pho came out in 3 mins! Pho soup is full of flavor but the portion of noodles and bmeat is smaller than I've expected, vegis are really fresh but cillantro is little dry. it will get you full though.	3	Pho Kim Long	3.5
"Small yet inviting ramen specialty restaurant. Handful of menu items that wouldn't take you more than 3 mins to choose from. Very flavorful and thick miso soup base. An ideal place for lunch.

I've eaten at countless ramen places including Japan, Korea, Asia, EU and handful of other states in US.

Bowl itself was small but deep. I immediately noticed that ingredients and noodles were drowned in soup when I got my ramen bowl. As I was working on my bowl, I felt disappointment that all noodles were gone with about 7 mouthful. Dont get me wrong, soup base is pretty good 4\/5.

For price of average $8ish I felt that it wasn't enough to make me feel full or satisfied, Im a skinny guy. Ratio between ingredients and soup was 1:2.5. I found myself fishing for solids and spent twice longer trying to get myself full by drinking the soup. Extra ingredients were little pricey to add. 

I would have loved it if the ratio was about 1:1.25. Little more generous portion of noodles and ingredients. I actually think that this business will do better if these things improve in the future.

Best wishes."	3	Fukumimi Ramen	4
"It's worth the wait, rave and hype.

Interior
It's located inside Palace Station and this Oyster Bar is clean and they have about 16 high seats. Try to avoid long waitline and crowd by coming here during off peak hours which are lunch and dinner hours.

Food
Everything here is above par and good but try going with popular house dishes that are mentioned on the menu. Portions are generous and they charge $5 for sharing a plate. During happy hour oysters are so much cheaper by dozen.

Service
Even though it's really busy most of the times services are prompt and friendly.

Overall
Food they serve here are something you can't recreate at home and something that makes you come back for more at least once every month. I don't regret coming here even though waitline might be long."	4	Oyster Bar	4.5
Had Indian,  Chinese,  korean, Taiwanese, Malaysian,  Japanese curry before and this place is where you come when you're homesick with mom or dad's curry. Nothing really special but special in some ways, such as adding extra toppings like cheese, corn, extra meat, veggies for extra cost and being able to choose how spicy you want your curry. 1~4 is low and 5~10 is high. Croquettes are really good though. Be sure to order your plate with at least 2 extra toppings, plate looks boring without it. Price for what you get seems little on top.	3	Japanese Curry Zen	4.5
"When it comes to milk tea in vegas, kung fu tea.
I come here for the winter melon tea, it's on the sweeter note but as ice melts you can appreciate it's true taste."	4	Kung Fu Tea	4.5
"The Only reason this play gets 2 stars are for interior design, bartenders, and their drinks.
Took them over 40 mins to seat party of 5 when there was 6 tables open, 27 mins for a glass of wine, 42 mins for 60 oz. medium rare steak that came out cold and close to rare, bringing out the steak on a cold skillet didn't help either. When they cut the steak they should know the temperature of the steak but no, they just serve it anyway. Truffle mac & cheese felt as if precooked and crumbling dry. Amount of fat on the steak was little more than 25%. I will come back for the great drinks but not for the dinner."	2	Herbs & Rye	4
It was a total disaster! Our waiter never showed up, waited 15mins until other waiter noticed. This busboy brought out our orders and didn't know how to place the plates on the table. Ordered 3 dishes but one of them didn't show up until i asked for it 15mins later when we were having our last bite and when it came out it was half ass. The host told us that they accept diamond membership card but the waiter told us that they do not accept membership vouchers. Food was under par and too salty. If this is how PFC represents Asian cuisine to the tourists from around the world in Vegas, it's a disgrace. Panda Express does better job than PFC.	1	P.F. Chang's	3.5
Service was exceptional, presentation was great for both drinks and food, cooking techniques are things you see on a TV show, steak was overpriced but cooked skillfully. It's something that you would experience in many other restaurants these days without paying almost $900 for three people, I don't know what was so special.	3	Bazaar Meat by José Andrés	4
"Don't EVER order pho from here.

Missing so many ingredients from what I've ordered when I specifically asked for sliced onions and cilantro with pho but not only that, its missing basil, jalapeno, lime wedge, hoisin sauce, sariracha sauce too. Noodles were packed so compacted I can't even break it apart in a boiling hot soup.

I'm telling my university friends to never order from here. My dog wouldn't even eat it."	1	5 Dollar Cafe	3.5
"I've been eating sushi, sashimi, and AYCE over 20 years and this is my 3rd time visiting this place within a year and I'm disappointed to say that their quality went down.

Fish quality: was above par but nothing to be wowing over.

Service: was great and our server Phil was very knowledgeable of their menu items, chef's skills and experiences.

Sushi: were inconsistent and sloppy, ratio between rice to fish was outrageous.
They ran out of Uni on early Friday night.

Rolls: were pretty good due to sauces but sauces and amount of rice were overpowering the main ingredients.

They do count the hours down, try not to go over hour limit.

Overall, ehh.... I will not come here again. There are number of better sushi places in Vegas. Do your reseach and you will find a better AYCE for your money."	2	Sushi House Goyemon	3.5
"Probably the most upscale thai restaurant right outside the vegas strip. Surprised to know that they take reservations and their signature dishes are hard to recreate.

Interior
Might think of it as hole in the wall place but the walls has been decorated with pictures of celebrity and famous chefs that visited this place. To put the cherry on top, you can't miss the glass window wine cellar right in the middle of the restaurant filled with great selections of wines and sakes.

Food
We asked our server to select two of the bestsellers and he recommended garlic prawns and crispy duck in panang curry. It definitely hit the spot, as in, when you don't know what to eat and feel like being adventurous and finding a hidden gem. Portion was perfect for two people and I WILL come again to try other dishes.

Service
Very courteous, easy going, makes you smile and feel comfortable, can't ask for more."	4	Lotus of Siam	4
"OMfreakinG- the food at Scotty's kitchen, inside the rum runner is AMAZING! Everything is so fresh, and practically everything is made from scratch on the premises.  They make their own fries here. And onion rings, and breaded mozzarella, and marinara. They make their own hamburger patties from 100% angus beef. They even make their own pickles!
 I tried the Hatch green chile cheeseburger with the fried egg on top. Probably the best burger i've ever had. My friend tried the Korean fried chicken wings- awesome and unique. Id never heard of them before. -Super crunchy, and a little sweet n spicy.
 We also shared an order of ""Scott"" fries! And let me tell you, i will never be satisfied with plain old fries again. Cant wait to go back!!"	5	Rum Runner	4
Easily the best BBQ in vegas!  The Duke fries are absolutely AMAZING and don't forget about The God's Sauce!!!	5	Jessie Rae's BBQ	4.5

"Server\/Host was terrible. Dropped by for some drinks with a family I was showing around town. Was around 4pm on a Thursday, the place was dead. We were not greeted and as we waited. Someone from our party sat at the bar that was, and was basically scornfully asked to get off the seat. Its understandable(they were under drinking age), but they could have handled it better, I mean the place was dead no need to have a fit. 
We ordered a few beers and beverages while we decided on some small things to nibble on. HE seemed really annoyed that we didnt order any food at first. ANd seemed really bothered evertime he came over. 
We orderd guacamole for the chips at the table, it was amazing, and a tostada. It was decent but the meat seemd reheated and dry.
First impressions were poor, would not recommend."	2	La Comida	3.5
"of course they have good food! and its not that expensive, 50 per person unlimited () 
but if you go there at first they gonna serve you a lot and then they are not going to serve you for 40-45 minutes!!! because they want you to feel full and not eat anymore! its called unlimited but they have a limit and they make you to eat less! service is not good! you have to ask them to give you food! and at the end they ask you for tip! rude!"	3	Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse	4.5
eh the food is not bad but its expensive and not worth the money! i got cheesesteak sandwich but it was so hard to eat and  salty!	3	ARIA Café	2.5
"Located in a strip mall, this restaurant is a hidden gem! My hubby heard about it from Diners Drive-ins n Dives and wanted to try it. Our waitress was really helpful and recommended several dishes to try as it was our first time eating there. She just about mentioned everything on the menu, so we decided to order 6 dishes for the four of us. Everything we tried was delicious and fresh.

You get a basket of bread to start your meal. The Bulgarian spice blend in the wooden spice box on the table, mixed with the olive oil, was so tasty! We debated getting more bread but decided to hold off for the rest of the dishes. We ordered stuffed grape leaves, Mediterranean salad, beef stroganoff ragu, the Bulgarian mixed grill, Thracian clay pot, and chicken shish kebab. We liked everything, especially the ragu, grape leaves, and mixed grill plate, and found ourselves satisfied. We ordered a baklava to share for dessert and liked that the syrup was very light and thin so it wasn't so sweet, like the kind you buy from the store. 

If we're ever back in the area, we'll be back to try more from their menu!"	5	Forte European Tapas Bar and Bistro	4
"Worst buffet ever!! Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else!

We stayed at TI and got a 2-for-1 coupon, which is only good for 1 person so our family of 4 had to pay way too much to eat here even though they're cheaper than other buffets. Now I know why!

Very little variety, flavors bland or non-existent, food overcooked. Strike one! 

My hubby and son love red meat and couldn't find a single slice of prime rib that wasn't well done from being stacked on top of each other in the warming tray. Strike two!

My daughter was eating her cotton candy for dessert and a gnat landed on it while she was eating it and got stuck in it!! Nasty! Strike three! 

The only good part...our waitress."	1	The Buffet At TI	2.5
"Hubby heard about this place on Diners Drive-ins and Dives so we thought we'd give it a try. We were seated within 5 minutes and just beat the crowd. Our server gave us some suggestions since this was our first time. We were tempted to order ramen but figured we could get that at home so we opted to get burgers.

We liked the salt n pepper fries and calamari, not so much the takoyaki balls. All of our burgers were delicious! We had the Ronin, Black and Green, Miyagi-san, and Spicy Miso. Mine was too much for me after eating the appetizers and fries, so I took half back to the hotel and had it for a snack later that night.

Service was really good, too. If we're back in area, we'll definitely come back!"	5	Bachi Burger	4
"Absolutely one of the best burgers in the whole city.
Come Monday through Friday between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. for the amazing lunch specials. 
It's a little Smokey because it's a bar but that staff is always very very nice and customer-friendly.
I also like coming here to watch the UFC fights.
The place is one various awards for its bar food which is all amazing."	5	Scooter's Pub	3.5
I read a lot of good reviews about this place I figured I'd come try it out. Really nice little deli close to the college. Absolutely the best pastrami sandwich in the whole city.

So this place was recommended to me and it's absolutely fabulous. Locally owned farm-to-table Super Fresh and delicious food. I just had probably the best burger I've ever had in the city. They also have a great freshly made lemonade. I'll definitely be recommending this to everyone and coming back frequently.	5	Honey Salt	4
The food and service were spectacular. My family and I came here after my college graduation ceremony and was treated better than I could have ever imagined. I would recommend coming here to anyone looking for the perfect fine dining experience!	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
The portion size for the price is ridiculous, the real price of the food is maybe $5, but you are being charged at least double. The quality of the food isn't that great, the employees just stood around and were talking and it made me feel really uncomfortable. I would never recommend eating here to anyone, save yourself the time and money and go somewhere else.	1	Strip N Dip Chicken Strips	4.5

"I had a great meal with excellent service. 

Food:
Bread basket was great!
We shared the polenta with mushrooms - so GOOD!
Cavatelli with wild boar ragú - hubby liked 
Short rib angliotti - really tasty 
Chocolate cake hubby said it's one of the best he's had - perfect temperature
Panettone - very good. 

Service was on point. We never needed anything. 

We'd definitely return. I'd like to try the regular tomato basil dish. 

The best part was meeting the owner, Scott Conant! Boy was I star-struck. He was very kind gracious to allow me to interrupt his meal. He offered to have his picture taken."	5	Scarpetta	4
What a meal and dining experience! I ordered the Ceasar salad, Beef Wellington, and Sticky Toffee Pudding. Superb meal! Best Caesar dressing. Wellington was cooked perfectly - meat was to tender, like butter! But I wasn't crazy about the overall flavor. I really couldn't taste the mushrooms. Eh, but the meat was divine! Potato puree was silky and the best thing ever! Mac and cheese was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. Hubby had double pork chop and he loved it. I even got to taste it - amazing! Sticky Toffee Pudding with brown butter ice cream was to die for. Hubby has a chocolate pudding thing. He said it was very good. The only downside was that it was served in a dish that makes licking the bowl impossible. We can't wait to return. Pricy, yeah. But this is Vegas and you should indulge while here. Worth every penny!	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
"With so many choices, it was hard to decide. I ordered the cucumber salad as an appetizer. It was light and refreshing! We settled on cashew chicken and orange beef. The cashews were the best part of the dish, but the sauce and chicken lacked flavor- quite bland. Also, too many veggies and not enough chicken. The orange beef was amazing! I could eat several plates of that dish all day long! 

The service was good. I'd return to try other plates."	5	Ondori Asian Kitchen	4
Breakfast was good. I ate the Italian frittata. Hubby had waffles. Hot chocolate was huge and rich. Coffee was so-so. Service was friendly and prompt. I'd go back.	4	Courtyard Cafe	3
"What a great restaurant! Great service and great food! We can't wait to return! 

Good bread basket, but someone should say that some breads have nuts-I'm allergic to them. 

I ordered the tomato bisque, a prime steak, and grilled asparagus. Hubby ordered pork chops. Everything was phenomenal! The soup was huge and a bit salty. I couldn't finish it. The steak portion was also huge - 12 ounces! I only ate half because I really wanted dessert. And the asparagus was good as well. 

Hubby ordered a molten chocolate cake that, for once, wasn't piping hot, just warm enough for his liking. I ordered the bread pudding. I was in heaven! That was worth breaking my diet! We'd definitely recommend this place!"	5	Alder & Birch	4
"We went here on a Friday night and enjoyed a good meal. Hubby had a baked pasta, and I had their pasta special with chicken, shrimp, etc. with Alfredo sauce. Both dishes had tons of pasta! 

Hubby's dish tasted really good. I liked the tomato sauce. My dish was eh, for me. All of the meats were good, but the sauce lacked flavor for me. 

We ordered desserts: a chocolate thing and the panna cotta. Both really good. The coffee was incredible! 

The service was nice and prompt. We'd return to this place."	4	Nora's Italian Cuisine	4
"We enjoyed our breakfast. I ordered the beef bourguignon Benedict, and the hubby ordered the blueberry waffles and a side of eggs. The hollandaise sauce was a proper one. Finally, one that has flavor for the meal. The eggs were poached perfectly, and nice crispy hash browns. I especially enjoyed the French bread instead of the usual English muffin. Hubby said his waffle was light and crispy. It had a ton of blueberries on top. The syrup was made from fresh blueberries. He also said his scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly, not over or under cooked and fluffy. 

Our service was great. The server was friendly and approachable. She answered all of our questions and didn't make it seem like it was a burden. Water was always filled without asking. 

I can't wait to return and have some French onion soup and bread."	5	Mon Ami Gabi	4
"Where to begin? First the front of the house was one of the most rude individuals I've ever come across in the restaurant industry. The restaurant was extremely crowded. Looks like the restaurant would trade more tables for customer comfort.

Our server seemed overwhelmed. The steak was sub par for the price and the fries were luke warm and salty. Not great. I would go here only if the price was dropped about $10 a plate. Don't order the baked goat cheese unless you like a lot of tomato sauce. 

My advice? Utilize space better and get the buskers off the front of the restaurant."	2	Mon Ami Gabi	4
It took me 15 minuets to get through the drive thru tonight. All I order was a 20 piece nuggets. They didn't have salads or apple pies available. The drive thru use to be ok but I notice problems with slow service mixed up orders over the last few months.	1	McDonald's	2
Best sandwich place you can find! So happy they opened one here in Vegas after going to their locations in Denver so many times. Great vibe, delicious menu, cool staff. Everyone must try Cheba Hut.	5	Cheba Hut	5
This is one of the worst restaurant experiences for a celebrity chef restaurant possible. Long waits, both in line and at the table for everything. Inattentive servers that have their bussers do everything for them. Expensive cocktails were the only tasty thing, otherwise it was extremely overpriced mediocre Mexican food. Upcharges for every single item or condiment ordered. Save yourself money and time and go to another restaurant and enjoy yourself.	1	Guy Fieri's El Burro Borracho	3.5
Ate there last night with couple of friends. Food was excellent. The service is excellent. It's a tapas house so everything is a small plates serving. But the serving sizes are just right share with three other people at the table. We got six different entrées they were all good I could particularly liked the shrimp tempura but all entrees were good	4	Firefly	4.5
I don't know what I was expecting, but the burgers are amazing as well as the oxtail fries.  The menu looks very interesting and I hope to be back soon.	5	Bachi Burger	4
We stopped by yesterday because I wanted some fried ice-cream. The entire family was surprised at how good the food was. It tasted home made and the price was very affordable for the quantity and quality. Defiantly going back. Loved it.	5	Las Cazuelas	4.5
"So I'm a little Cheese'd at Park right now. 

Park on Fremont is an awesome place to go regardless of the time of day. I've been going for two years plus now, especially on the weekend with friends for brunch. The atmosphere is cool, the food is good, and the drinks are always on point. The one thing I would love to see change for the next time I go back is the return of the Mac n Cheese balls. The best item on the menu, maybe one of my favorite things anywhere in Vegas. We would order several with our brunch and I would often order them to go home with me as well. Please, Please, PLEASE bring the Mac n Cheese balls back we can all enjoy them again! Coming from a long time customer. Even if it's only on the brunch menu. Thanks, hope you can make it happen."	3	Park on Fremont	4
Yeah Panera bread here is always behind. They don't care about how long you wait or if your order is correct. There should not be an online order option if you cannot even fill the order on time. It says pick up asap 5-10 minutes. Then our order took 40 minutes and everything came out at different times at the wrong temperature. Save your money and find something better. Starbucks is next door.	1	Panera Bread	3.5
All around absolute wonderful experience. We chose to partake is the tasting menu because it included the risotto and Beef Wellington and of course due to HK Gordon Ramsey is know for these.  We also chose the Wine pairing. Everything was AWESOME!  Service was great. The price shows how great it is. After all including tax and tip we spent $592 for two people and it was worth it!!	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
This is my go to Chinese restaurant. It is nothing fancy, just tasty, cheap, quick Chinese food. Family owned, the owners are super friendly!

"Things start out with 5 star friendly service from Enrique, then came the drinks. Took Enrique's recommendation and went with the Cadillac Mango Margarita, whew! That hit the spot!!!

Since he was spot on with the drink, went with his recommendation for dinner, Cochinita Pibil. Best I've ever had!

Waiting for dessert (flan), but fully expecting that it's going to exceed expectations.

Thank you Yelp, as I found a new favorite Mexican food spot in Vegas!"	5	El Dorado Cantina	4
Toby's is an awesome little dance hall and bar. The live bands and dj are always good and keep you entertained. The bar is a little pricey but the drinks are to die for.	4	Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill	3
It was pretty good. Wish they had more spicy pizza selections. At least pepperoni and jalapeños.	4	Round Table Pizza	3.5
"I ended up here because of a coupon with misleading wording. The food was simply disgusting and way too expensive. Service was untrained and way too amateurish. If you consider yourself a fool, have bad taste, or do not know any better in life, then this is the place for you.

Not convinced yet? The steak was dry and tasted awful, the salad bar was extremely poor in terms of quality and presentation. Again - service lacked of too many things. I was fooled by these people. Please, do not be fooled yourself either.

One last thing. They ruined the whole Brazilian steakhouse experience for me."	1	Pampas Churrascaria Brazilian Grille	3
Service is slow and not very friendly. Food was cook to order so that was good. Restaurant is in a food court at the Mandalay Bay and they acted as if I was bothering them by eating at their establishment.	2	Johnny Rockets	2.5
Wonderful experience!  Food was excellent and they had a wonderful wine selection. Views are top notch from the 64th floor of the Delano hotel. Be sure to make a reservation.  Staff was very knowledgeable and service was quick and attentive. I recommend checking it out!	5	Rivea	4

Top Golf is a very modern "bowling alley" for golf. You are able to play target style games at a driving range. The big up side is having your own pit style dining directly at your tee with a waitress and TV entertainment. There are numerous bars and restaurants and places to hang out.  Even a pool if interested. We paid $60 per hour and got drinks and lots of food for two hours   We spent about $100 each with four people..  I recommend giving it a try..	5	Topgolf	4
Best buffet in town. Selection is the largest and ALL of the food is fabulous. I had a piece of price rib that would have been $50 alone in any restaurant.  Service was great. We are planning on returning every time we are in Vegas.	5	Bacchanal Buffet	4
Went in on a Friday night without reservations and got right. Service was quick and attentive. Food was great! Ordered a filet medium rare and it was cooked perfect. It was a little loud and open to noise but tolerable.	5	StripSteak	4
We went for brunch at 10am is walked right in. They were not too busy and the room and seating was comfortable.  Selection was ok and the food quality is what to expect at a buffet. Nothing unbelievably great but everything was good.  We added the unlimited champagne for $5 and it was good.	4	Bayside Buffet at Mandalay Bay	3
Great restaurant!  Service is top and wine selection is unmatched. Their is a huge cavern that someone repels down to get bottles of wine. It is pretty cool to watch while dining. Food is great. I would recommend trying it!!	5	Aureole	3.5
Visited BLT Burger on recent weekend stay to Vegas. My wife and I split a Burger and fries between the two of us and had a few drinks. The one thing that really stands out is the service. The server for the area that my wife and I sat in was really swamped, but the on duty manager or supervisor came cover and took our orders. He didn't only take drink orders, he allowed us to place our food orders as well. I must say this was a first and made my wife and I very pleased. Awesome burger!	4	BLT Burger	3.5
I've never been here til today but this place has been our base for mostly everything that has been distributed for the Las Vegas shooting. They're amazing & the teamwork is amazing. I'll be coming back just cuz the staff is awesome & been so involved in the community. & the pizza is bomb. Ok I'm done. Thank you !!!	5	Evel Pie	4.5
First time here at this restaurant & I will be coming back. Awesome experience. Awesome customer service & they have a beautiful clean establishment. Lovely staff. Kai was my server & he was amazing. Thank you!	5	Brio Tuscan Grille	4
"Heavy-handed salt spoiled it for us.

Martinis- tasty and cold 

Shrimp app- delicious especially with the fire sauce.

Capresse- delicious mozzarella, ok non flavorful tomatoes

Large filet mignon medium-rare (split)- great taste that was obscured by almost overwhelming salt. The split was actually a horizontal slice of the meat so we each got a 3\/4 inch thick piece of steak. 
Shoestring fries- well cooked, Just the right amount of crunch. But way too salty.

Sauteed spinach- perfectly cooked, not swimming in cream. But way too salty.

Dessert- our taste buds were so over-salted, we couldn't do it, and asked for the check.

Our waiter, Paul I think, was (as he would say)...Awesome!"	3	Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse	4.5
Oysters not great, got the whole fish for dinner. Good is all I can say. Not a date place. Great service. Not over the top expensive	3	RM Seafood	3.5
Really nice place. Not a date place, or I would have to give it a 5. But, great steak. And the crazy thing we all agreed on were the sides! Don't miss the spicy rice! Every side was as impressive as the steaks. Our waiter was great as well. Expensive and worth it!	4	StripSteak	4
I love the place. It's not the sexiest steakhouse for sure, but classy. The service is second to none. When you approach the restaurant and see the cases of aged beef out front, that's a good indicator. I was not disappointed. The food was fabulous. The portions are large, so if you're not starving, split some items, especially the sides. Great steaks though. Will return	4	Gallagher's Steakhouse	4
Sorry..... my all time favorite deli. Not good. Place was impossible to get into last year. Empty now. No wonder. Not even close to what I remember over 40 years. Won't go back. Sad	2	Carnegie	3
Well, it's the closest thing to being in Germany as you can be. The beer is flowing, it has an authentic look, right down to the waitresses dress. The food was great, but I don't know much about German food. I really enjoyed it and would go back. Great experience.	5	Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas	3.5
Nice place.... great service. But, they brought my friends burger raw. Took care of it. Off the check, so cool. Food rating ahhh... I like a double double at in and out way more at one third the price. French fries are great. But, I wouldn't recommend it.	3	Burger Bar	4
An amazing surprise birthday for my boyfriend was held here and I couldn't be more happy with how the entire thing went! The staff was absolutely the sweetest from the hostess, waitress, food runners & all. In the reservation I let them know what it was for and they gave us the best seat in the house to accommodate the surprise. The food was awesome everyone loved it and they even gave him a hand written hard and an amazingly delicious cake. Thank you R&C for making his night so memorable I really appreciate it. Can't wait to come back!! Xoxo	5	Rice & Company	3
Worst experience ever in Las Vegas!! Room was disgusting and wasn't going to complain until I tried to take a shower this morning and you either get a super hot shower or super cold. No in between. Plus the drain doesn't work so you not only get a burning hot shower or cold one but you get to sit in the vegas scum your are trying to shower off from the night before. Then when you ask for help two hours later they send up a service guy that can't help you until another two hours. When I spoke to the front desk they said they will switch our room. I informed them I wanted to go eat breakfast before we switched rooms. They promised to hold a room. Once I get to the front desk they have no idea what I'm talking about and Marco front desk tells me there will be a wait for my next room. I informed him I was told a room was already being held for me. At this point I start to get frustrated and ask what happen to the room that was promised. He pretty much told me he can refund my money and I can find another hotel. I reminded him that all hotels are booked and its march madness right now. He said again he can refund me to go somewhere else. At this point I ask for a manager. Imelda comes over and again reminds me she can refund my money to go somewhere else. Nothing they promised me was followed through and now I'm pissed. I finally give up and ask for names and let them know I will be filing a complaint. Then I give my phone number to them to call me once they pull their heads out of their asses. As I am walking to the elevator Imelda calls me and said she has a room ready that's a suite with one bed and a pull. For you to get any service or help you have to go through a miserable five our ordeal and ruin half your time on vacation to get any help. Worst service in my life will never recommend this hotel or restaurant to anyone. Hate this place in hell.	1	Hooters Casino Hotel Las Vegas	2.5
"We've been to No Regrets Bar several times in the past few weeks, always for the late night happy hour. It has always been a great experience. We have always had a memorable time. And we drive from Summerlin. So needless to say, we kinda go out of our way to be there. So tonite we decide to check out the early Happy Hour. Wow, what a different experience. You'd think we were two people with leprosy considering the way we were totally ignored by Karla. We sat at the bar in the very middle. Over a two hour period we had several drinks. Each time I had to flag her down to place an order. We've sat at other bars in the far corner and received better service. 

We gave Karla the benefit of the doubt until it came to getting the bill. We were charged normal price when we clearly ordered during happy hour. I tried my best to bring it to her attention, but my efforts were all in vain. So after I wrote on the receipt what the correct amounts should've been, I left leaving $0.00 for a tip. I'm a very generous tipper, ask any of my regular bartenders at PT's. But I was so dismayed at the service that even $0.01 would've been generous. I was generous with my rating because of all of our past experiences there. But the next time I go there I will turn around and walk out of Karla is on duty. It I could title this post, it would have to be, ONE REGRET....We will stick to the late night happy hours for sure! And BTW, the chicken strips with ranch are awesome!

UPDATE
Shawn, thank you for taking time to provide a thoughtful response. You're right, we are all human and errors & misunderstanding can occur. We do miss hanging out at your establishment and will be back very soon! I'll be sure to ask for you, it would be a pleasure to meet you. Thank you. Mark S."	4	No Regrets Bar	4
My third time here. Busy Saturday night, 1.5 hour wait for party of 10. The wait was worth every minute. Great food & service as always!!!	5	Hobak Korean BBQ	4.5
"I couldn't decide what to order, so on Daria's recommendation, I tried the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It was FANTASTIC! The pork was extremely tender and perfectly seasoned. The homemade BBQ sauce was delicious as well. I like the sandwich better than BJ's Brew or Gordon B. 

Give it a try and tell Daria I recommended it..."	5	Sierra Gold	3.5
My first time here after searching for a place away from the Strip. I was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality and friendly staff. They had a full house on a weekday at lunch hour. The food and service were both excellent. It was the first bacon cheeseburger that I truly enjoyed in a very long time.	5	Mr Mamas	4.5
Based on some of the great food pics, I really looked forward to trying the boneless Kalbi & eggs. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with my visit. It's awkward to have to stand in line to place your order and then go find a place to sit if you're planning to dine in. The food tasted ok, but the price points are off in some things such as their coffee. $3.45 for an average cup of coffee in a paper cup with only one refill is not worth it.  And like others, I don't care to be nickle & dimed, especially when their prices are already on the high side, especially when being served on paper plates. All of the pics of Kalbi & eggs shows fried rice. Well if you want fried rice, that's another extra charge...No thanks, I'll cook my own garlic fried rice!!!  The place has potential, but they need to consider the feedback from customers. I hope they make adjustments before it's too late.	3	Cinnamon's	4
The cocktails are good, but the food isn't nearly worth the price. It's average at best, but everything that I ordered was seriously lacking flavor. When I ordered the food to go, it was all crammed into a tiny box. The foods meant to be crunchy\/dry were drenched in the sauces of other parts of the meal. I would stick to the buffet.	3	Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak	3.5
Had breakfast here. The service was friendly and efficient, the atmosphere was nice, the food was ok, the coffee was watery, blah.	3	Mimi's Cafe	3
My dog eats better food than this crap. Glad I spent a ton on this awful lunch. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else.	1	Five50 Pizza Bar	4
The food isn't fantastic but it isn't terrible either. They could use a greater variety of foods. They offered mimosas at every table as if they are supposed to be great, but the Brut champagne and orange juice just didn't pair well. There isn't a huge selection of alcohol but it's free to anyone in the buffet. Plus the military discount cut our bill in half, which was a welcomed surprise.	4	Cravings Buffet	3
I loved everything here. The salad bar is much better than the typical sort you see in chain restaurants like Ruby Tuesday's. The wine tastes really good and you get a sample before they give you a full glass of something you hate. It's a win win for customers and the business. The meats are all good and cooked to different temperatures, so you can get exactly what you want. The atmosphere is great and the staff is super friendly and attentive. They also have military discounts!!	5	Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse	4.5
"I've been dying to try this ever since my last trip to Vegas. Now that I have finally had the chance to try this place, I am so disappointed. 

The hostesses at the front were not a great impression on the restaurant. Where the heck do they find these girls? They all act as if they don't want to be there and seems there is nothing but air in their heads. 

Their ""tunnel"" that you walk through that connects France to England is so silly, especially the way the hostess explained it to us. 

The five of us were seated upstairs with a view of the casino below. The servers were very nice and informative. Our server brought out the cart with all of the cuts of beef to view. 

For drinks, I ordered the HK Antioxidant. This is a pretty sour and fruity drink that basically tasted like cranberry juice to me. My bf ordered the Sidecar which was a lot better so I ordered this drink for myself as well. 

I had to order the Beef Wellington as this is supposed to be Gordon Ramsay's signature dish. I also got a side of foie gras on the side. Let me tell you though, I wasn't impressed with what I ordered. The beef Wellington didn't have much flavor and wasn't as juicy as I thought it would be. The foie gras tasted like it was just thrown on the grill. Very plain tasting.

I tried my bf's American Kobe Filet and it was juicy and flavorful. A lot better than the Beef Wellington. 

Even though I wasn't too satisfied with my meal, you better believe that I ate everything on my plate! I had to get our money's worth."	3	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
"This was a nice surprise. Project Pie is just like the MOD pizzas in the Seattle area. You can add as many toppings as you want on your pizza for one price. 

The crust is thin and nice and crispy. They have tons of toppings you can choose from such as artichokes, basil, cilantro, prosciutto, etc. 

I wish they could make one of these in Seattle. I actually like it much better than MOD pizza. It's a good place if you're looking for a casual and quick place to eat."	5	Project Pie - MGM	4.5
"Even though I was excited to try this place, I didn't have very high expectations and I'm happy to say that this place exceeded my expectations  This is located in Las Vegas' Chinatown. 

The place was pretty crowded when we went. But I'm sure it's always like this. Our group ordered a spicy and medium spicy batch of crawfish, catfish, chicken wings. I'm sure there was more food, but I can't recall some of them. 

Everything we had was delicious. They aren't lying about their spicy level! Even the medium spicy was very spicy. My bf had sweat dripping down his face. But everything had a good amount of spice and flavor. I will definately make a trip back here on my next Vegas vacation."	5	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
"Came here thinking this was one of the better pho places based on the reviews. The broth was very plain. Especially after adding the bean sprouts and basil, it basically tasted watered down. I could barely eat the noodles because it tasted like noodles just boiled in hot water. 

Their 14 ingredient sauce for the spring rolls was very good though except the spring rolls didn't even have any noodles in it!

Service was great, but I won't be coming back for the food."	2	Pho Bosa	4
I didn't visit this location but our friends brought this to us to our hotel while staying in Vegas. These were some damn good burgers! I would say it lived up to the hype. I didn't care too much for their fries though.	4	Shake Shack	4
Good spot for a quick sandwich if you don't feel like eating fast food. The sandwiches are just okay. Nothing special but a good deal as all of the sandwiches are about $6 and it's convenient as a late night snack if you're staying in Planet Hollwood or near the hotel after getting out from the clubs.	3	Earl of Sandwich	4.5
"Went here the last day of our Vegas trip. It's a very cute restaurant that blares loud music. BF ordered the sliders and I decided on The Hangover omelet. I think deep inside I wanted to order this particular omelet because it reminded me of the movie (lol). 

I don't remember the name of the drink I ordered, but it was some sort of berry mojito. It was such a good mojito. I appreciated all the fresh fruits that were combined in there. The next time I'm in Vegas, I will be sure to try their famous frozen hot chocolate. 

There is also a to go window where you can order snacks and drinks if you don't feel like dining in the restaurant."	5	Serendipity 3	3
"We normally stop here for our pho fix when visiting Vegas and after trying other places out, this is one of the better pho places in Vegas. The pho and bun bo hue are both good. 

The sandwiches here are so good here! The cold cuts and the egg and Chinese sausage sandwiches are the best. I really think the bread is what also makes it so good. The bread is fresh and perfectly crispy!

The service is always great. The employees are always friendly and patient."	4	Pho Thanh Huong	4
"I've stayed at the MGM a couple times in the past but this was my first time staying in the West Wing rooms. 

The gentleman who checked us in was very friendly and patient. We told him we were redeeming the My Vegas Rewards. We were informed it was a long process for them to process these redemptions, but he was being very patient throughout the process. 

Went to our floor and realized we had a long walk ahead of us. These hallways are super long. 

The west wing rooms are very small, just big enough for two people max as there is only one King bed. The window is very small so not much natural light comes in during the day. There isn't much counter space in the bathroom. 

The nice thing is that everything is updated so it's very modern and there's also a TV in the bathroom mirror. 

Our room had problems though. One of the bulbs in the lamp went out. And on the morning we checked out, I plugged in the blow dryer and all of the lights in the bathroom shut off and wouldn't turn back on. 

I can't complain too much since the 3 nights were free for us."	3	MGM Grand Hotel	3
"Can't believe I spent $15 on this burger. I probably should have known better, having eaten at Gordon Ramsay Steak. Over rated burgers. Definitely not he best I have eaten. 

I ordered this to go and the burgers don't even include any fries or sides. The ladies at the front desk were nice. I wouldn't come here again. Burgers are way overpriced for what you get."	2	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
"This was our last resort for a nice dinner after trying to get reservations at other restaurants. 

We made reservations here and it was kind of sad to see that it was not busy once we walked down from our room in Planet Hollywood. The service was great and our waiter was very patient with us while explaining all of the dinner specials that night. 

We ordered fried calamari, rack of lamb, steak and crab and scalloped potatoes. The rack of lamb was crusted with dijon bread crumbs. I didn't like the flavor of the dijon with my lamb though. The lamb was cooked perfectly though and I dipped it with my bf's house steak sauce that he received with his steak. The calamari was perfectly cooked. It was very soft and tasted like it wasn't even fried."	3	Strip House Steak House	4
"The portion size ain't no joke here! Huge plates with tons of food. It's best to share a plate with someone. I ordered the fried chicken Benedict and boy was it tasty! The mashed potatoes that came with it were so flavorful and soft.

Service was really great. The waitress forgot one of the meals at our table and was very apologetic and even brought over the manager to apologize to us, which I really didn't think was necessary, but she did comp us for that entree which was very nice of her. 

I would come here again. Just make sure you have a big appetite!"	4	Hash House A Go Go	4
"This place is located in the Fremont casino. We decided to eat here because of their famous oxtail soup. $10 gets you about 4 huge pieces of oxtail. The soup was so hearty and flavorful. You also get a bowl of rice with it. So worth it and affordable!

They also had a deal (I want to say it was about $4?) where you get bacon, sausage, eggs and rice and the portion was huge. 

Line was somewhat long but worth the wait."	5	Lanai Express	3
Awful. Not much more I can say. Plates so hot that cold food is ruined. Food is either undercooked or overcooked and really awful. Save your money	1	Le Village Buffet	3
If there is a "0", I will give them NONE STAR! My gf and I went to this place for late dinner. First of all, the Iced Lemon Tea sucks! That is a very basic and normal drink in hong Kong style cafe, however, they f* up my drink. Second of all, my order took 50 MINS! My gf finished her food already, even next table's checked, my food was still not ready. Finally, when my food was here, I found there was egg shell in the egg! Either the food or service was unacceptable! Not to mention the price. Macaroni in soup which is the basic food in a cafe, I really don't understand why it took 50 mins. Won't come back!	1	Hong Kong Cafe	2.5
I tried this place for the first time and it's one of my new favorite places to eat. The mac n cheese is awesome and the chicken is really good. I definitely recommend it	5	Strip N Dip Chicken Strips	4.5
This was probably the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my life. I went with four of my friends and we patiently sat and waited for somebody to take our order for 15 minutes. When the women finally came up she said "what do you want" and when the second person started to order she said "hurry up I don't have all night" we waited probably a half hour for our food and they just never brought out two of the plates. And when we asked about them the guy rolled his eyes and came back 10 minutes later with them. When we went up front to pay our waitress walked up to us and said "where's my tip, gimme tip" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? If that's how you think you run a business you're very wrong. I have no problem tipping for good service, but after that night you all don't deserve a penny	1	Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant	2.5
The brisket, corn bread and Mac n cheese was really good but I seriously can not say enough about how awesome the staff was there. Probably the best experience I have had in a restaurant ever	5	Rollin' Smoke BBQ	4
Very nice and comfortable atmosphere! The Bar is Beautiful! My waiter it is amazing and the atmosphere is very laid-back and soothing.	4	Off The Strip at the LINQ	4
The breakfast that we ordered absolutely amazing! I had the chocolate chip waffles it just melted in your mouth. I love this place!	5	The Pub at Monte Carlo	3
Super good Clay oven pizza, right around the corner from my hotel very convenient! I will definitely come back here when I visit  Las Vegas	4	800 Degrees	3.5
On our last morning in Vegas, my friend, my boyfriend and I just wanted to relax and have a good warm breakfast...nothing wild so that we could calmly take in the beauty of the place.  We walked to the Venetian and right on the corner toward T.I., there was this adorable little bakery (which I now know is part of the Bouchon Cuisine) that smelled of fresh roast coffee.  We ordered the Turkey Sandwich and this really amazing wrap with Chicken, apples, nuts (i think) and coffee.  We sat outside and had a nice view of the strip and the front of the Venetian.  This place was great, and I highly recommend coming here to try...even just a small pastry!	5	Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian Casino	4
"What a buffet!  The food was soooooo delicious and the desserts....THE DESSERTS!!!  I won't need to elaborate on the food except...you should try it!  But, I did take away 1 star because of the following:

1. Of course the ""best buffet in L.V."" has about a 2 hour wait on Sunday evening at 6:30pm...still it was worth it.

2. We came in a group of 6 + 1 baby.  When we got to the cashiers, we told her that we had that many in our party and she told us that they only have seats for groups of 5 or less.  What?!  I don't believe it!  So we said we'd split if that was the only case.  When we got to the end of the line for seating, we saw TWO groups of more than 7 people (who were in line WAY behind us) go in together!  When I asked the host why we were told they didn't have tables for 6 or more, she told me we asked to split up!  And that if we really wanted to, we could've pretty much begged the cashier to put us together, but our wait would be much longer.  WHAT?!  The family BEHIND us didn't have a ""much longer"" wait than us.  

Usually, with service like that, I'd take at least 2 or 3 stars off...but it was good food, AND the waiters who walk around were SO nice!!!!  Yes, each person is about $51 during weekend dinner time, but this is a top buffet...I think it's actually CHEAP for what you'll get!"	4	Bacchanal Buffet	4
"I love this restaurant.  It's a GREAT American style breakfast, and an awesome way to start at least ONE of your Vegas mornings.  Yep, just like everyone has mentioned, the Banana Nut Muffin is amazing.  Soft, warm, full of delicious Banana Nut taste!  We would've taken some more to go if we didn't plan on going to the outlet afterward.

Our group ordered different items and not one of us had anything bad to say about anything!  We looooved ALL of it!  The potatoes were very good too.  It's a place everyone should try at least one morning here.  Seriously...GO TO EGG & I!!!!!  NOW!"	5	Egg & I	4.5
"This outlet is not bad.  There aren't as many stores as North, or other outlets, but it does the job for general shopping when you're around Las Vegas South.  This is a mostly indoor outlet, in comparison to the North Premium Outlet.  During the Summer, this outlet is the way to go to beat the heat!  There are a few Promenades with stores outdoors, but during the summer heat, we skip those all together.  There's plenty of parking outside.  I heard that we should head to the Customer Service center to get a discount card, but we skipped that.  

Overall, a nice stop before driving home from Las Vegas.  Discounted store with Nevada tax rate makes it better than buying it back home in Los Angeles! Will come back again!"	4	Las Vegas South Premium Outlets	3.5
Panda Express is god compared to this place. Grossssssssssss	1	Noodle Shop	2
This place is great! The pizza is good and the chicken fingers are amazing. If you get the Chicago deep dish, which I recommend you do, one person is only able to eat about one slice so a large pizza will go a long way. We always get the zeppole too. Highly recommended!	5	Rosati's	3.5
We split pancakes and an omelet. So freaking good.  They are some of the best pancakes I've ever had.  Worth the short trip from the strip!!	5	Mr. Mamas	4.5
One of my favorite Japanese tapa place in LV.  I especially love the foie gras custard and foie gras with soy based sauce (very rich).  If you are in a group, it would be good to get at least one omakase.  We have been going there for the past 4 years everytime we visit LV, and its been consistent everytime.	5	Raku	4.5
We've always wanted to try this but after having dinner at Raku across, we don't have room for dessert. So this year we've decided to do dessert first. They used to have 3 courses and now they only have two (for $15, ala carte for $12). We ordered all 3 items from the left (we'll try the right one next visit). Carib is hands down our favorite. It's panna cotta with fruits and mouse and sorbet poured over by hot mango sauce. Clean, full of flavors, refreshing and not that sweet.	4	Sweets Raku	4.5
UNBELIEVABLE SERVICE! Good will speak for itself. Best suishi I ever had, however our service by Sarayay (#195) set this restaurant apart from others. Will definitely recommend others to come see Sarayay (server#195)!! Ask for her service.	5	Raku	4.5
"I came here for dinner with my buddies for my birthday.  This place was recommended by a buddy of mine who lives in Vegas.  It's about 10-15 minutes off the strip.  Typical Vietnamese restaurant setting.

We ordered two hot pots and a few side entrees (sorry, I can't remember the name of the dishes).  All were very good!!!  No disappointment there!  The staffs were quick and friendly.

They were also very accommodating...maybe because one of my buddies asked them if they can bring out a cake-like-dessert to surprise and sing happy birthdate to me.  Turns out they didn't have any (at least that's what I was told)...but they improvised and brought out a red bean moon cake with candle and yes, they along with my buddy sang the birthday song to me.

I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas and try other stuff or just stick with the hot pot again! =P"	5	Hue Thai	3.5
"It was a special request from one of my buddy during my last trip to Vegas in July.

The burgers are really good...not too greasy.  I had the double.  The fries could use some help...they tasted hollow.  One bite and you're thinking to yourself, 'hey, where's the fries?'.  Sorry but McD's fries are better.

The service was excellent and quick!  The place was crowded as usual but what do you expect at In-N-Out?

We just need In-N-Out Burger to come to Washington State!"	4	In-N-Out Burger	4
"OMAKASE DINNER!!!  That's all I need to say....

So good and so worth it at $96 (for two).  The food not only taste delicious but also looks like art!  All the sauces are unique and made in house.  Seafood are fresh.

Can't wait to go back when I visit Vegas again.  Wish they open one in Seattle!"	5	Yonaka Modern Japanese	4.5
"I came here twice during my last trip to Vegas in July.  That's says how much my buddies and I like it.

They have a pretty big menu...ranging from your typical Pho to Bun Bo Hue to Com (rice) to Banh Canh (I think).  Most ""Pho"" restaurant only have Pho and maybe Bun Bo Hue but this place has options.  So it would please everyone in your party.

I ordered the Com (rice) the first time and it was ok - I wished the portion was a little bigger.  The second time, I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and it was pretty good.  Both times, I ordered the Che Ba Mau (3 bean dessert) and I must say, it wasn't that great.  The che (dessert) was a little bland.  I'm not sure why I ordered it a second time knowing what it tasted like the first time around...maybe I was hungry and wanted to give them a second try.  But yeah, it needed additional sugar or sweetening.

This place is about 5 minutes off the strip.  I would give it 4 stars but the Che left a...actually, it left nothing - no taste.  I would come here again, but will most likely skip the che (dessert)."	3	Pho So 1	3.5
"So far so good...

My buddy who lives in Vegas took me here last year for lunch and man was I glad he did!  I think it was $14 or $16 per person (sorry, I can't remember).

They have the typical food selection you would find at any Korean BBQ restaurants.  So there's not much surprises or disappointment.  Yes, you do have to cook your own food but it's an experience, especially when you bring a friend or two (or more).  The staffs are polite and accomodating.

So if you like to eat and eat and eat...this is it.  It's a way better alternative to eating buffets at the casinos.

I give this place 5 stars because of the price, food selection, staff and the ease of getting and cooking your own food.

Also, it's about 7-10 minutes off the strip...you can catch a taxi to get here but there's not much taxis to get back, you can always call and have a taxi come pick you up, you just have to wait.  But if you have a rental car during your stay at Vegas, definitely visit this place.  You'll at least give it 4-5 stars!"	5	Sura BBQ Buffet	3.5

"Another venture in Vegas always leads to eating some kind of fucken asian food. WHY?!!?! I LIVE IN GARDEN GROVE!! We go to vegas and eat ASIAN FOOD! WTF?!

So as I am dragged around by others, (all my friends are many variation of asian) we hit Bosa 1. Place is packed to the brim with all types of different people. There was not a long wait in line because they are extremely efficient at bussing and getting people seated. 

Not expecting much at all from a Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas we sat down and proceeded to order. Right away i noticed speedy and friendly service that was taken as a complete shock because as I mentioned I live in Garden Grove, the capital of rude asian restaurants, service is non existent in this city. Our orders came out almost as fast as we ordered! I had bun cha gio which happens to be one of my favorites and when it came it was HEAPING with egg rolls and all types of boom boom POW. 

What seemed to be the owner or manager was always checking up on us, this guy was cute. I ordered in Viet and he was a bit taken but appreciated it very much. Mid way I wanted some Thai tea, he came up to me and i ordered it, I took a bite of food, looked up and it was in my face already! WTF!? In Garden Grove\/Westminster if you are even lucky enough to find somebody to help you and order from, it would usually take until the end of your meal and constant nagging to get them to bring you anything! 

They are definitely doing something right."	5	Bosa 1	4
Very mediocre chain Mexican food. Ordered tacos that were super dry and then got charged for aioli.  Seats were uncomfortable and service was very average.	2	Cabo Wabo Cantina	3.5
"Totally in the mood for fish and chips. So where else should I go while staying at Mandalay. So I ordered the fish and chips and a Guinness and its MEH not extraordinary just a basic gut fill of soggy fries and ok fish that was huge like whale size. 

Service was good but they were really pinchy on the tarter sauce and when I asked for more it literally took 15 min to arrive. All in all I won't be going back. And please place a shamrock on the pour or don't call yourself traditional Irish."	2	Rí Rá Irish Pub	4
Great burger great fries and a nice shake.   This is by far the best burger I have had outside of Ray's Tavern in Reading Michigan.	5	Burger Bar	4
Vince Neil's is a great bar and grille inside Circus Circus full of Mötley Crüe memorabilia. However, the place is definitely under-staffed. The steak fries are delicious and the burgers are pretty good as well. The Wild Side BBQ Bacon burger was excellent and the Mac & Cheese Feelgood delight was good also.	4	Vince Neil's Tatuado EAT DRINK PARTY	3
I've been in Vegas for about 7 months now and I've gotten tattooed at Revolt right across from Dog Haus a couple of times yet i never actually been to Dog Haus. But after getting tatted one day and being super hungry, I decided to walk over and grab something to eat and let me tell you..... THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. The workers are by far the friendliest people I've ever met in a food place. The food was cooked in a decent amount of time and it tasted great. I got a Slider Dog and the Ava Maria burger. The thing that really surprised me is the fact that the buns is actually Hawaiian King's bread. The sweetness from the bread complimented the rest of the food really well. I'm from Hawaii so using this bread made me feel like I was back home. I'm disappointed that I never tried this place out sooner. Highly recommend trying this place out if you're ever in Vegas.	5	Dog Haus	4.5
"I've been wanting to go here for months and finally managed to try it out. When we got there there was 2 parties in front of us but the worker at the front was in a really bad mood. We got seated after about 5 minutes. Server asked us what we wanted to drink about 10 minutes after being seated. He came back, took our order, and the food took about another 10-15 mins. Which wasn't bad. 
However, 1) we never got bibs 2) we never got cutters for the crab, we had to ask a different server for it 3) our server didn't check up on us till we were just about done eating. 
The food was okay. I should have gotten Baby Spice instead of Mild because it was hotter than I expected. Our stomachs were really upset after eating. I also noticed another person sitting near us who complained about her stomach being sore as well. 
I would go back to Hot N Juicy Crawfish but maybe I'll try out the other location instead. I'm rating it 3\/5 stars because the customer service was terrible."	3	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
"SO GOOD!!

Perfectly cooked lobster in a warm\/toasted\/buttery bread roll. AH! DROOL!
Clam chowder is the best I've ever had (for my taste preferences). I loved that every bite was filled with lots of potato and generous chunks of clam, it was very hearty and bursting in flavor, and it wasn't heavy on the cream. Just a really well-balanced clam chowder. It was a perfect complement to the cute outdoor setting in the Vegas winter. 

Which reminds me: Luke's Lobster is its own little kiosk outside. I was super hangry and lost for a good 10 minutes looking for this place. But definitely worth the hunt!"	5	Luke's Lobster Las Vegas	4.5
"I don't think fish & chips can get much better than this. 
The fish: perfectly cooked; batter was thin and crispy; noice and moist
The fries: we upgraded to the parm\/truffle; lotsa good flavor
Sauces: Gordon's tartar was perfection- all the relish and acid made it light and it really brightened the inevitable greasiness of fried fish. Sriracha aioli.. as much as I hate when restaurants make Sriracha-mixed sauces, it was actually quite nice. Good heat and not too heavy.

Overall: bueno! Minor complaint about their soda machine- it was puttin' out some flat soda. Never had flat mountain dew until I came here."	4	Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips	4
"Cashier named MARTA was extremely rude with the interaction we had with her. Tried to explain to her that we were waiting in line for 45 mins, after being told to do so by the gentleman who also worked at the buffet, she ignored and cut me off. I attempted again and she says ""you'll have to wait in line again."" It would be understandable if she acknowledged that if was a mistake by another employee but ignored everything. Customer service doesn't work that way. If you are in a bad mood or has had a bad day you should be able to not allow it to show or should not work directly with customers. 

The food was great so this one star is strictly towards Marta's customer service and the the person(s) in charge of staffing that department."	1	Bacchanal Buffet	4

Favourite place to go on a Tuesday or a Thursday Tuesday because kid free Thursday is because me and my son love the grill steaks	3	Golden Corral	3
Can't wait to take my kids.. I was thinking.. so I called to get pricing an more info about the place. We ended up going there for my son 9th birthday. Before I went I looked at the web sit to make sure I had enough money to make everyone happy (kids). It's just over priced for no reason some of the games were not working there out of pasta had to wait 7-8 min for one slice of pizza and they had more salad out then anything the pastry areas like everything was three weeks old. I wasn't happy they at the end of the day They suck so bad.. lord	1	John's Incredible Pizza Company	3
"The room was great, we had a tower room. For added security you had to use your room card in the elevator to go anywhere which we like. The room itself had a great view and was very clean and had air conditioning which was helpful for the hot weather.
I would give it more stars, but as far as the slots and games at the Palace Station, they were not giving any money back even after I put in 200.00. 
Next Time if I have to opportunity to stay there, I will just sleep there and take the shuttle to the strip and walk across the street to the Wynn where I had alot more luck."	3	Palace Station Hotel & Casino	2.5
"Incredible location. Outstanding service from our bartender Stefan. Good food and bottomless Bloody Mary's? Oh, we'll be back and certainly recommending to friends that visit downtown. 

Had to take away one star because the Bloody Mary mix left much to be desired. To be fair, my wife and I have spent a lot of time in the capital city of bloodys (Wisconsin) and have very high standards for our favorite hangover cure."	4	Downtown Terrace	4

We took some guests who are visiting from Europe here last night.  Our experience in the past has been very good.  Last night, however, was very bad.  When we arrived there were several tables within our sight cluttered with the remains of previous diners.  We were told we would have a 15-20 minute wait for a table.  We were seated before that time had expired... But then we waited for about 10 minutes before being offered water or other beverages... Not acceptable especially when they were not busy.  We were also short two table settings and had to ask for them from the server.  When he bought them, he simply put the silverware in a pile on the center of the table and didn't bring any additional napkins.  We had to ask another server to bring those.  We had to ask for a replacement for one of the small plates used for bread as it was dirty.  I ordered steak and frites, my wife the French Onion soup, and our guests ordered the pot roast.  My steak upon arrival was tepid at best and either the frites died waiting at the pass or they were microwaved.  In either case they were inedible and I sent them back.  Neither of the servings of pot roast were hot and on one plate the mashed potatoes were downright cold.  I won't write off Mimi's just yet as any place can have an off night and our previous experiences have been good.  However I will be cautious and our next visit will most certainly not include guests.	3	Mimi's Cafe	3
My search for the best Mexican food in Las Vegas is over!  Friends introduced us to Leticia's last Saturday and we will be forever grateful to them.  The menu is amazing with a nice balance of traditional and contemporary dishes.  The chips are fresh and very tasty and they are accompanied by a couple of different salsas and a warm bean dip giving everyone something to enjoy.  The house Magurita was reasonably priced and enjoyable to taste.  For my entre' I ordered the beef enchiladas and I thoroughly enjoyed them!  If you order a combo, be sure to ask for the white rice instead of the traditional Mexican rice with tomato sauce.  I have never had anything like it in my life.  It is delicious! Our server was attentive and made sure we were happy throughout our dining experience.  I plan on visiting often.  Leticia's is a treasure!!	5	Leticia's Mexican Cocina	4
"O M G!!  Dined here last night with another couple.  My girlfriend Victoria and I were celebrating the end of our first (and last) fight.  What a great experience (Capo's, not the fight).  

We had a reservation and were seated quickly after arrival, once we made past the door keeper.  That, in and of itself, is a trip!  We were given menus and water promptly.  The menus were thoughtfully provided with small flashlights to make reading them easier in the subdued lighting.  Overall the ambiance  is pleasant and the staff knowledgable, personable, and attuned to the needs of their guests.  The place does tend to get a bit noisy what with a vocalist performing and dozens of tables filled with happy diners so if you are looking for a quiet, intimate dinner you would be disappointed.  However, if you are looking for exceptional service, exceptional food, and exceptional entertainment, you won't find any better in Southern Nevada.  My girlfriend's husband had Shrimp Scampi, she had Chicken Picata with Garlic Risotto, my wife had Spaghetti with Meatball (it's a HUGE meatball), and I had Lasagna with Crumbled Meatball.  Every dish we were served was abundant and fabulous.  

As for the entertainment, the vocalist is a nice touch.  He performed well and visited several tables while singing.  And the magician, well he is an absolute WOW!  He performs table side and mystifies.  I named a playing card at random (the eight of diamonds) and it magically appeared out of the deck.  He handed it to me along with a Sharpie (which we all sniffed) and I signed it.  He then proceeded to amaze us all by having the card move through the deck, apparently at his will.  He also did things with coins and table settings that had the four of us just shaking our heads in wonder.  

So here is the bottom line on this place; if you are looking for a fine dining experience with peaceful, calm surroundings, pass this place by.  However, if what you are seeking is a dining experience encompassing great Italian food prepared like mama would fix it and served by attentive staff, an atmosphere where everyone is enjoying life and entertainment that by far exceeds the price paid for the meal alone, then you best get to Capo's sooner rather than later!"	5	Capo's Italian Cuisine	4
We tried this place for the first time last night for dinner.  We were not even a little disappointed!  i ordered the meat and cheese lasagna and my spouse had a chicken calzone.  Both dishes were excellent.  The sauce on my lasagna was EXCELLENT... one of the best I have ever eaten.  I have to assume the calzone was just as good because I wasn't even offered a single taste!  I was told the crust was light and flakey and it tasted delicious.  Our server was training a new employee so we got plenty of attention.  A+ on service.  The only thing I can suggest they improve is the salad and dressing.  The salad was nothing more than a bowl of iceberg lettuce, two thin slices of tomato and a few Bermuda onion rings.  Visually it missed the mark.  The addition of some color to the bowl in the form of a few shreds of red cabbage, maybe a little shredded carrot , an olive or two, and a few croutons would be a big help.  The Italian dressing I ordered was also a disappointment; much too oily and lacking flavor.  The salad is the only reason I did not give this place five stars.  I will become a regular and can't wait to continue exploring their menu.	4	Mark Rich's New York Pizza & Pasta	3
Great experience!  Food is exceptional, plentiful, and reasonable.  WARNING!!  Unless you are absolutely starving, share a meal.  We shared Chicken and Waffles and still couldn't finish it all.  The place is clean, the servers compentent, and the food is first class.  My only recommendation would be for the young lady who answered the phone when we called about a reservation... lighten up.  You were curt and cold.  We almost decided against going there because of you.	4	Hash House A Go Go	4
"So, last Friday my honey and I attended a ballet at The Smith Center.  By the time we picked up the car from the valet it was past 9:30PM and we were STARVING!  All dressed up in our theater finery, we didn't much feel like fast food and the thought came to mind that we had never tried Gordon Biersch on Paradise and it always looked inviting from the outside so we thought, why not?

So glad we took a chance.  We got there about quarter to ten and were quickly seated.  Admittedly, they were not busy at that hour but still, it was nice being attended to so politely and with such courtesy.  Our server came over moments after we were seated and introduced himself to us.  Being that it was our first time there, he went over the menu with us and based on our feedback, made some recommendations for beverage and food.  I ordered one of their craft beers and my sweetie had a glass of wine.  Both were very nice.  For dinner, I ordered the Jambalaya and wifey the Chicken Pasta.  OMG!  Both were so good!  Her Chicken Pasta was full of flavor and my Jambalaya had just the right amount of ""bad"" in it to be wonderful.  Oh, and the desserts?  You know how so many places bring you way too much after a full meal?  Well here, they offer Mini Dessert Tasters, giving you just a few bites to finish off your meal, leaving a sweet taste in your mouth.  

Satisfied does not even begin to express how great an experience this was for us.  We will definately put this on our list of prefered places to dine.  I have over 100 girls coming to town early next year and may very well arrange to have this as one of our dining options during the week they are here!  Well done, Mr. Biersch!"	4	Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant	3.5
We tried this place a couple of years ago and weren't impressed.  Thinking perhaps we may have just hit them on an off night, we decided to give them another chance last week.  Sad to say, we should have stayed with our first impression.  After we were seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge we were there and at least get some water.  This was just the beginning of extremely poor service.  When our food arrived, mine was wrong.  I had ordered beef enchiladas and received chicken.  When I pointed it out to our server, he offered to take it back, but being that my spouse had already been served, it didn't seem fair for their food to go cold while waiting for mine, so I just accepted what they served.  As before, the first time we were there, the food itself barely made mediocre.  Mexican cusine is one of my absolute favorites and this one repeatedly falls short.  There is no life in their plates.  The food just sits there begging to be taken away.  It is bland and unimaginative and very unsatisfying.  I understand that this is one of three or four locations Michoacan has in the greater Las Vegas area.  This one has runied the brand for me and I most assuredly will not be returning here or to any of the other locations.	1	Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant	3.5
"Space was nice, BUT: 
1. We were seated 20 minutes after reservation time. 
2. Waiter reprimanded his assistant, saying he embarrassed him where we could hear.  
3. Waiter ""pushed""food telling us things weren't very big portions. 
4. Our water glasses weren't filled for most of the meal. 
5. Side of asparagus didn't come out. 
5b. When pointed out, asparagus came right out and was lukewarm. Likely sitting out the whole time. 
6. An extra drink was on our bill.  
7. Waiter kept constantly apologizing, very awkward. 

Food was mediocre at best and definitely not worth the horrible service. Will not return or spend my money on Giada products. I'd choose Walgreen's pre made sushi first."	1	Giada	3.5
This is a late review, since I ate there last in September, but since my family just went there over the weekend, I feel I can rely on it still being a fantastic place.  One of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to.  It was as high end as it gets for a Mexican restaurant without being stupid.  The handmade tortillas (which you see being produced in the window) are to die for.  The service was very helpful.  My go-to, enchiladas, were fantastic.  Take it from this Southern California Latino, Michoacan is a must-do.  If Michoacan want to come to Long Beach, I'd be happy to help!	5	Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant	3.5
"Don't let anyone talk up pasta like it's going to change your life, it's just pasta...
With that being said, the pasta at Scarpetta is pretty damn delicious. If you're going to pay $25 to $35 for a pasta dish, Scarpetta is the best place to do it.

We visited Scarpetta at 8 PM on a Thursday and sat at the bar until our table was ready. The bartender, Nicole, was a delight. She opened a bottle of Sauv Blanc for me since they did not serve any by the glass, and that's what I was looking for. I can always appreciate someone who goes above and beyond to make sure that the paying customer gets what they're looking for. The ""crack chips"" at the bar are highly addictive, don't even start...

We were seated shortly after taking a few sips of our drinks at the bar, near the window where we could see the Bellagio water fountain show. I was expecting the view to be more romantic and clear - there are beams and walls that are kind of in the way. Regardless, it's a very nice view (I just feel that they advertise it a bit differently than it actually is). The service was great and so pleasant. We ordered a braised short rib appetizer that was delicious, along with the spaghetti dish, pichi dish and the side of mushrooms. Everything was damn near perfect. I prefer my pasta a bit more cooked, but I can appreciate that the Scarpetta way is how it should be done, with hand made pasta, in house. The sauces are so amazing, the flavors are just perfect...

We didn't have any room for dessert but next time, I swear I will get into those bombolini nutella things, they were on every table and looked so good.

The ambiance is quiet and calm and it felt so good to get away from the chaos that is Vegas. I've eaten at many vegas restaurants and I feel that Scarpetta is perfect for a date and low key evening to enjoy one another's company and some GREAT italian food!"	4	Scarpetta	4
"I wish I knew our waiters name but honestly, I will never again dine here or recommend it to anyone. Carnevino should be ashamed of themselves for having a staff as terrible as who served us. $1500 dollars later, all we are talking about is our terrible waiter, terrible service and what a joke this place is.

We dined at this restaurant the evening of 3\/17, a party of 11. Our waiter PUSHED for us to get this pre fixed however many course meal, and was not taking NO for answer. He was rude, pushy and just terrible. When we said that we all wanted to order on our own, he got even more rude and horrible. Our waiter refused to take our drink orders, he would actually cut us off, mid sentence, and say ""AFTER I take your FOOD order"". I wanted to let him know that the restaurant makes a ton of money on drinks and he should definitely make sure to keep us happy on the drink front. He was TERRIBLE. The food was fine, but the service really ruined everything. When we did FINALLY get drinks, they were make incorrectly. What a joke.

Gratuity was included in the total of our bill, and we left nothing extra. The waiter then approached the bill payer and harassed him about the additional tip. Is this for real? Who does that? Carnevino, I would love a chance to speak with a manager about this, we should have that evening but couldn't wait to get out of there. What a disgrace. Never again."	1	Carnevino	3.5

"I was not expecting to love this place so much. I figured it was more about the vibe and novelty of the whole Beauty and Essex pawn shop in the front gimmick...
I was so so so wrong, and I am so glad I was.
I hadn't read the reviews and hadn't heard anything from friends who had dined here but I'd love to shout from the rooftops about how delicious the food here is, and exciting too..

Our waiter was amazing, I think his name was David (?), he was top notch and wish I could just have him as my waiter everywhere I go. Stellar job, amazing attitude, he made the experience fun and we were so grateful to have him as our waiter. That being said, I am not sure if I've had a dinner that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed our dinner at Beauty & Essex. We ordered the ahi tuna tacos, and then we ordered another order of them after we finished our entire meal - yes, they were that good. The flavors are perfectly balanced and these are just SO good. We may have gone back the next night and picked up a quick order of these ""to go"" because we could not stop thinking about them! We also ordered caesar toast (yum!), the french onion dumplings (holy moly!), the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumpling (amazing!), scallops (prepared perfectly) and... I think that was it. Oh, and bone marrow (ahh, why you gotta be so good?!). 

Everything was phenomenal and I could have sat there all night, eating everything over and over and over again.

We had to get dessert, right? The donuts are killer good. Light and fluffy served with 3 sauces (chocolate, butterscotchy caramel and a raspberry sauce) - *sigh* these were so freakin' amazing. We also ordered the PB ice cream thing which comes topped with pretzels, I don't even have the words to describe how amazing this one was. Beauty & Essex, you done did a great job and I cannot wait to come back. Everyone who works here is so friendly and you really don't get that pretentious vegas vibe that a lot of other places give off. Oh, it is loud inside, but you wont be talking much because the food is really that incredible and there are no words great enough to describe it.

I really hope this place stays as good as it is right now and doesn't go through that rough patch of bad service and inconsistency. B&E, thank you for such a wonderful experience, and to our waiter, you are the man!"	5	Beauty & Essex	4
"The ambiance and food is good. We ordered many of their small plates to share: calamari steaks, octopus, hamachi, duck fat fries, brussels, cauliflower and bone marrow. Everything was OK, there was nothing I ate that I would say was exceptional. However, everything did ""look"" pretty tasty and while it did taste good, again, nothing special.

We ordered the grilled cheese, a couple salads, the tuna tacos and some sliders. I would say the grilled cheese was the best of all these selections. Nice presentation and really tasty as well.

My one gripe about our experience was our waitress, she seems so over it before our wine even came out. It was a bummer because I truly believe the experience is a huge part of eating out (at least for me). She was dry and emotionless and seemed annoyed overall, which put a damper on our experience, unfortunately. Also, the place was pretty empty, which was weird for a Saturday night in Vegas at 9 pm. 

I think I prefer Herringbone Las Vegas...but probably wouldn't turn down coming here again, the food was decent enough to try again."	3	Searsucker	4
"This review is for guest services which quite honestly at a hotel with this much ""history"" and so many brands under its belt should be ashamed of the experience I had. I had to call the hotel 7 times to get a copy of a receipt. 

I spoke with a woman in guest services who argued with me about a charge and told me I disputed it because she didn't see it. I asked very nicely to speak to her manager and she said no. She kept arguing with me and then said she would transfer me to accounts payable ... because I'm a vendor? What on earth?! I called back and asked that she not speak to me so rudely and that I just wanted to speak with a manager, she argued some more and hung up on me. Quite honestly, I'm appalled at how I was treated. I don't think I was asking for anything out of the ordinary. In fact, when I called in the day before, the representative saw the charge I was looking for and said she sent a receipt - I didn't receive it though. The run around and chaos that is MGM Grand Las Vegas is atrocious. I would never again voluntarily give my money to this place. Unfortunately their portfolio houses many of the hotels in Vegas (and other places) but from my recent experiences, they're all going south. There's no excuse to treat customers this way. MGM, you should be embarrassed and I hope you kick your measly and incompetent employees to the curb."	1	MGM Grand Hotel	3
"I am not crazy about WF and have been let down by pretty much all of his restaurants. CUT was no different. We were here for way too long, everything took forever. Our server had just about a -2 personality on a scale of 0 to 10, it was just bland and boring (the experience and the food). Apparently  the corn is what everyone is crazy about. If the best thing on your menu is corn, I think you should revisit things...
Just my opinion.

We ordered tuna tartar, corn salad, poached egg and asparagus, the crab louis appetizer. Everyone at the table got steak (rib eye, filets) and someone got the sea bass, which they de-bone for you upon bringing to your table on a cart, which was pretty neat.

I ordered my steak medium, confirmed that it would be ""pink in the center"", no blood. The steak showed up burnt on the outside, so I was really itching to cut into this thing. Sure enough, well done. I think it sat under a heat lamp for nearly 20-30 minutes. The staff was really apologetic and brought me a new steak quickly, but I wouldn't expect anything less when paying $65 for 8oz of meat. It still didn't blow my socks off.
For sides we ordered: mushrooms, corn, brocollini and a couple others - they were OK.

For a good steak, head over to Mastro's - always. You can't go wrong.
This place just did not do it for me."	2	CUT by Wolfgang Puck	4
I've never had such slow service before.   Our order wasn't even taken until 30 minutes after we sat down.  It took another hour for the chef to come out and cook.  The chef was not entertaining at all.  He cooked very slow.  The fried rice was terrible, The shrimp is not good, It had way too much lemon.  Even the mix of vegetables was terrible, it was a couple pieces of zucchini with a huge pile of onion.   One person in our party had the lobster, she could not eat it it was that terrible.	2	Benihana	4
"Terrible.  Service was terrible, food was terrible..... Waited 10 mins to order drinks.  The mozzarella sticks were not melted.  The sirloin was cooked right temperature but had a terrible taste. Waitress never even checked back to see how our food was, even thought my entire steak was still on the plate pushed to end of table.  
I now know why it was so empty when we got here.  I will NOT be returning."	1	Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar	2.5

"They're a bit off the strip, but not a far cab ride away.

Haven't been back to Vegas recently, but still remember that this place is amazing. The service is blow-your-mind adorable. The wait staff is incredible and they're such sweethearts. Eventhough I found their lamb very ""lamb-ie"" (which ""if it tastes that way, then the chef wanted it that way,"" ), I was still so impressed with everything else that it didn't even matter. 

Rosemary's is one of my FAVORITE restaurants ever."	5	Rosemary's Restaurant	4.5
"This was the beginning.

Many many moons ago, shortly after I had turned 21, on a trip with the girls and guy to celebrate our newfound glorious world, we arrived at GB. It was a first. We were curious. Asked the waitress what she suggested. Among other things 
""Why not try the glazed chicken wings with honey and ginger?"" 
""Which beer do you recommend with it?"" 
""Try the Marzen.""

Next, and this is the important part, is the tasting. Take a sip (or two if it pleases you) of beer, a bite through the crispy chicken wings, and another sip of beer. Note how the interaction of the chicken wing sauce pairs PERFECTLY with the beer and brings out subtle flavors and nuances that went previously un-noticed. 

My friends, a fascination for beer, finger foods, and more beer begins here.

And, yes, I HAVE heard, and have experienced the sad decline of quality and consistency of GB over the years. *sigh* a painful sight to taste and watch. But, still, your Marzen and wings holds a special place in my heart, even if you do change the sauce."	5	Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant	3.5
"Happy hour  = $6 Mojitos, Capirinhas, and select food.

We ordered a few dishes for happy hour here and found some hit and miss. The wonderful ceviche with came topped with a fabulous salad. The salad dressing was heavenly: light sesame oil and just a hint of spice. The crunchiness of the salad balanced well with the slightly cooked fish.

Besides the ceviche, the other dishes were not very unique. The sushi was uninspired and the squid was okay. Everything presented well.

Try: Ceviche (They have several kinds)
Skip: Sushi"	4	SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas	4
"Try the Oxtail Soup Combo!

Tucked inside the Fremont hotel in downtown Vegas, this little hole-in-the-whole, fast food, Panda-Express-like place fitted in perfectly with the rest of the downtown scene. No glitz, no frills, just an authentic, real, and delicious experience. Plastic utensils, wooden throw-away chopsticks, seating that would put Subway to shame...The staff was incredibly friendly, joked with us, and teased us as we asked them about the oxtail soup. 

Yes, that's right. Oxtail soup. 

We came here specifically to find this delicacy, and were not disappointed in the least. Tender, tasty, hunky meat that falls off the bone with the touch of a spoon. Topped with a good handful (or two if you're nice) of shiitake mushrooms and fresh-cut cilantro, this amazing meal befriends your wallet at a mere $7.95 (with or without white rice)!

In conclusion, try the oxtail soup combo!"	5	Lanai Express	3
Mi wife and I travel often and we love to visit this place, The bartender Angel is super friendly, awesome & hooked up the liquor which made everything else better. They have so many great drinks on the menu & everything tastes like candy. We had a few cocktails and really enjoyed the variety. The drinks were really good and creative. I ordered the raspberry bourbon mule and my wife a raspberry lemon drop. Let me just say, our martinis was made with fresh muddled raspberries and tasted perfect; the equal parts alcohol and equal parts raspberries and pink sugar around the glass rim were on point. it was a great choice! I loved the decor so elegant, but comfortable. The atmosphere at the bar and restaurant is really nice so it felt like we had the place to ourselves which was nice. The service was excellent and the food was great! I started with the French Onion Soup which was amazing! The broth, the bread and the gooey cheese made the best French Onion soup I've had to date. My wife chose the Rice Au Gratin with chicken. It was creamy she was also curious about grape, basil and ricotta flat bread so we definitely had to order that! It was also topped with candied walnuts, arugula and drizzled with balsamic. It wasn't crazy over priced like restaurants on "the strip" and it was just as good or better. Definitely a great hidden spot just 10 minutes for the strip. We will be coming back :)	5	The Sparklings	4
"Great place for ramen that is close driving distance to the strip. 

This place seats about twenty people and you should be prepared to wait on a weekend. 

The service was very fast and friendly. 

This ramen place is run and owned by Japanese which is always more authentic. 

I got a spicy tonkatsu ramen and the fried rice.  The portion was very large, extra noodles for $1.50 if you like. 

Ramen: broth hot and spicy, on the saltier side, the hot sauce was right on target, pork was super tender and fell apart easily with my chopstick, veggies nice and firm. 

Fried rice: good size portion, plenty of veggies mixed in, nice side of ginger slice.

Prices: very reasonable, all the ramen dishes were under $10 bucks. Fried rice portion was about $7. Japanese tea for $2 beer for $3


This is a solid ramen place in Vegas. Never impressed. Will return here again in the future."	4	Monta Ramen	4
"After reading many reviews for this restaurant, I was so excited to go there for my birthday. Oh but what an extreme disappointment this dinner was. Seriously if you left n9ne five stars you must have a horrible palate because the food here was definitely not five star quality. Also, I am a firm believer that the wait staff can add or take away from a dinner. Our waitress was horrible and completely inattentive, which is not what you would expect when you are spending close to $1000 for dinner and alcohol. 

I started with a Caesar salad, which were OK. Not anything special. The salad was just your typical caser from any steakhouse. Next came the rib eye. The rib eye was less than OK. I have had much better steaks at Maestro's City Hall and even Flemmings (which doesn't say much). I ordered my steak medium and it came out mooing. Gross....  We ordered the gnocchi ( gross, everyone who thinks these are good must have the taste buds of a three year old, I mean seriously these tasted like perogies... real gnocchi is served at Quiessence), string fries (pretty good), and garlic mashed potatoes (typical steak house potatoes) for sides. After a horrible dinner which I could barely eat I decided to order a few desserts because I will still hungry. I ordered the Oreo cake (pretty good in taste but the texture was too soft like it had been sitting out for awhile), the apple pie (SUCKED), and the smores (were fun, but not really tasty).

The wine and alcohol selection here is amazing. I did get my fair share of alcohol, so the entire night wasn't a complete waste. 

When the bill came out, I was shocked to see that not even one of my desserts had been taken off the bill (geeze it was my birthday!!!).  Which in my opinion is pretty lame considering how much money we had spent. 

So hopefully some of you who read this will decide not to waste your time and money on n9ne!!!!!!!!!!"	2	N9NE Steakhouse	4
Had so much fun the night I went because we were able to dance with the band! Not a popular destination but it works well if you want to get trashed with a group of fun people. The atmosphere was laid back and if you're nice enough to the bouncers, you'll get in without cover. The patio was also a fun place to hang out. The view was amazing too. The music was not the best but if you're intoxicated, it won't matter!	4	VooDoo Rooftop Nightclub & Lounge	3.5
"Yum Yum and more Yum!

Gosh...219 reviews? What more can I add?? All I can say is this is a MUST if you visit Vegas. The food is delish...especially the crab legs and kobe beef. Their dessert buffet is huge too. Sucks they ran out of chocolate covered strawberries. =(

Tip: The line on a weekend can get very long. I suggest you go there early or ask someone to wait in line for you. You can't be seated until you pay for everyone in your party."	5	The Buffet at Bellagio	3.5
Charmingly southern restaurant!  Food is some of the best outside of New Orleans.  Gumbo is especially good.  Service is prompt, courteous and informative.  Good stuff!	4	Lola's A Louisana Kitchen	4

"Want an amazing brunch with spectacular service outside of the congested strip? Look no further than Echo & Rig in Tivoli Village. We made reservations for 9 am on Saturday (Open Table) and were seated early. We were given water as soon as we sat down (upstairs) and our menus. Our busser (not sure the appropriate name) made sure that our drinks were filled the entire time (I had an Arnold Palmer (don't have Chai Tea Latte) and my husband had a coffee) and our plates were taken as soon as we finished. 
Our server was Nan and she was awesome. She informed us that Echo and Rig overnight their freshly caught seafood from the California coast. My husband and I started off with the avocado toast with shishito peppers and this was delicious. We then ordered the Farmers Market eggs (my dish) and the Steakhouse Scramble (my husbands). My dish was healthy, and delicious and wasn't one of those dishes that weighs you down after you eat. 
As long as the temperatures are down and the weather is nice, I'd recommend eating outside because the view is really nice overlooking the fountains and the market that is open at 10 on Saturdays.

Well I had high expectations being that I'd heard about this place on Man vs. Food and was already a big fan of The Boiling Crab.  The biggest disappointment about my visit to Hot N Juicy was the service.  There were plenty of empty tables around 1pm but we stood at the door for quite a while before we were seated. Then after we were seated, we waited quite a bit longer before we placed our order.  The food came out slowly and so did the check.  In addition, the food was OK but I definitely prefer Boiling Crab and I'm glad that's the one near me!  I gotta say I was let down a bit by this place. The crawfish didn't have that sweet taste that I'm used to at BC and the rice was crispy and undercooked. Maybe it was an off day but I think I'll try some other places next time I've in Sin City.	3	Hot N Juicy Crawfish	4
Only complaint I had was they don't offer a combo Pastrami and Corned Beef in any other size than the Two Pounder...Really?  Yeah, their draw is huge Deli Sandwiches and the food was New York Authentic Deli...a bit warm, not hot but they ought to offer healthier portion sizes for those who want it. I wasn't able to order a half or child's size. If you do order, I suggest a take out box that you can give to some poor soul on the Strip to eat like I did.	4	Carnegie	3
Back again last week Nd Happy to report they still rate 5 stars! I had the special of Prime Rib Hash.  Watch out the Regular Stack of Pancakes would have fed my wife twice! Nice location a short walk from all the glitz of Fremont Street Experience.	5	Eat.	4
Pricey for what you get, Turkey club was just a little better than average, crab cakes were good.  Other meals in the rest of my group were just too average to even mention.(Charles Barkley Jumbalaya) Service was attentive, but all of the staff there need a little better attitude, hostess girls were horrible, waitress was cold.  I know working in a casino is tough, but part of your job is putting on a good attitude for customers.	2	Red, White & Blue Restaurant	2.5
Food was just ok, was with 3 other people.  On the burgers; buns not fresh, need more flavor.  Fries were blah, although friends said the sweet potato fries were good.  Service was mediocre, and the place was dirty, and this was a regular Thursday night, so it not slammed with people at all.	2	House of Blues - Music Venue	3.5
The pad Thai is very flavorful. All the prices are pretty reasonable especially for how much food you get. Off the beaten path but worth a try.	4	Thai Style Noodle House	4
"Whenever I am craving teriyaki and want to go some place fast, Teriyaki Madness always is the first place that comes to mind.
Compared to some of the other Teriyaki places it is a little pricey. But all others lack when it comes to taste and variety. 
A simple bowl already comes with great flavor. When you add the sauce they have, the taste is magnified. My only wish is that they would get more locations around town."	3	Teriyaki Madness	3.5
"If you want to start off the day right, your first meal should be at Hash House a Go Go. The establishment is just about serving breakfast; it is about serving breakfast right. With their giant portions, patrons are served favorite morning dishes with flair and style. 
When your plate comes, it is not just a plate. It is a canvas of color and texture with mountains of food. The chicken and waffles is not just chicken and waffles. It is a masterpiece of three or four bacon infused waffles interwoven in  between savory and crisp chicken breasts topped with fried leaks for presentation and encircle with a maple reduction syrup. 
The dish might almost be too pretty to  enjoy. Almost. As it turns out it looks exquisite, it taste beyond belief. But it is a masterpiece you cannot seem to finish in one sitting."	4	Hash House A Go Go	4
I love the Sunday Morning! Potatoes and cheese in a crepe. Plus a great selection of flavored mimosas.	4	Crêpe Expectations	4.5

won't sit you if the whole table isn't full. went at 1am and they said we had to wait til the next reservation was 230 and we'd have to wait. we go once a week and every time it's gotten worse. the food is good but to have to wait an hour an a half because they won't sit a 4 top without the whole table being filled is ridiculous. so disappointed in how terrible they treat their regulars. never going back again. and the host is a dick. fuck that place.	1	Musashi Japanese Steakhouse	4
Great place to take out-of-towners, especially if you know someone with a membership.  The view is spectacular.  A little pricey for food & drinks, but worth it.  Just be prepared for ultimate relaxation in their soft cushy sofas.  Next time, I think I'll go for a private room!	4	Foundation Room	4

I got a pastrami sandwich combo for lunch the combo cost 13 dollars and change ... I was very disappointed. .. the bread was so soggy the meat wouldn't stay on the sandwich.  I eat my lunch at work and I got it all over my desk .... I'm glad I got the combo I at least had fries to eat lol .... I will not be giving them any stars ..... it was not even average tasting ..... sorry but I will not be going back I have plenty of fast food restaurants that are better tasting and cost less close to my work !! They are making me do a star rating so you will be getting one star but only because I can't post without it .	1	Farmer Boys	3
Finally...decent, well seasoned carne-asada. Vegas is hit and miss with Mexican food. I guess I was spoiled being from Southern California and have high expectations. Their chips and salsa were excellent as well! I didn't have any drinks but I saw several other tables ordering some pretty legit looking margaritas. I will be back again for sure!	5	Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina	4.5
"visiting the city and our first time here  good vibes and the employees are  very attentive. 

i won a lobster from the lobster machine and they cooked it for me and we enjoyed it!!!"	5	Urban Crawfish Station	4.5
I ordered some flautas, they came out basically looking like taquitos and were crunchy and bland. I wasn't terribly impressed with the rice and beans either. It was kind of expensive, considering the fact that we walked out a little disappointed with the food. The salsa that came with the chips had a great flavor, but it was really runny and didn't stay on the chip. I had high hopes but unfortunately won't be back.	2	Casa Don Juan Mexican Restaurant	4
Definitely one of the best places here in Vegas. I moved here from the Bay Area, CA. The flavor and quantity is very good. Love their carnitas burrito and their street tacos.	5	Los Tacos	4
Great food and service. Love that they are open late! They have large portions and great prices. The service is always on point and they also have karaoke bar area that is separate from the dining area.	4	Aloha Kitchen & Bar	3.5

Came here on Tuesday November 11. I had the carnitas burrito which wasn't that good it needed more flavor, the cheese out did the taste of the meat. Also some of the fountain drinks were out of service.	2	Taqueria El Buen Pastor	3

It is time for Gordon to come down from the cloud , stop critics others food and bring his own place to order. Stuff not trained, need wait for service and was ignored when asked. Non stop bum kicks from servants to back on my chair. Food was mediocre at least. Lamb burger come with souse already start separating and half of bun was soaked in butter, definitely this one was sitting for some time, before was brought. Seasoning on truffle frys was ok, however frys it self was cooked in cold oil or was sitting for long time. Make it worse, got food poisoning from this experience, almost got to hospital, no other food was consumed after or 3 hours before. So it was only one source for that. Stay away, better food at Burger King, least fresher.	1	Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill	3.5
My favorite brunch spot in Vegas.  Love that their food items are locally sourced.  Bottomless mimosas anyone?	4	MTO Café	4.5
"I'm getting this place five stars simply based on the fact that they except BitCoin.

I ordered the rustica pizza as well as some garlic knots - both are very good."	5	Rustica Pizzeria	4
"Great restaurant.  We spent ~170 for wine, dinner for two. We split a salad, a pizza, and a pasta.  

Pizza was underwhelmingly generic . Pasta was really solid.  I don't think you can go wrong by going here for a meal.

Plus, if you sit ""outside"" you can see the ""sky"" change every 15 - 20 minutes! Other than the people shopping in the mall, it really does feel like you are outside by yourself under the deep blue sky for a romantic evening.  

Suggestion:  Place a campfire and ""beware of bears"" sign to make it truly feel like the outdoors."	3	Spago by Wolfgang Puck	4
I've been to the one on Windmill (really small place) and I've gotten food delivered from the Tropicana location. Bad service from both and the food was okay. Nothing special not really worth going to.  You can probably find better food elsewhere for the same price.	1	King & I	3.5
"You can't do chicken fried steak wrong most of the time but this place does it very well. 
The service was prompt and polite and I will definitely be back. 

Do yourself a favor and visit the place. Thank me later."	5	Our Families Country Cafe	4
Service was friendly and quick and the sandwich was excellent. They have a changing menu so check before you go so you're not let down if they took the sandwich you like off the menu but otherwise they have my business.	5	The Goodwich	4.5
"The staff here politely ignores you. 

I went in for lunch one day with my father and we hadnt received our meal in over an hour. We had to get the waitress or hostess attention for everything, drinks, apps we had ordered (seems that they forgot), bread........it took an hour. You figured theyd bring this stuff out as a courtesy. 

The manager was the worst. She trolled the restaurant the whole time and when she saw that we were looking to her to come ask how we were doing, she would make eye contact and keep walking. I saw her escape into the bar several times. Maybe it was to avoid having to look the patrons in the face. 

Either way, the food was average, the wait was terrible and they werent that busy."	1	Giuseppe's Bar & Grille	3.5
Disaster start to finish. Long wait for a table, really long wait for service, one order was wrong, one had guacamole that was grey\/brown. Manager tried to defend it, which was just sad. In the end, to be fair, they comped our food, but if I'd eaten it, no comp could have made up for what would likely have happened. Eat at your peril.	1	Sundance Grill	3
"Pure gluttony, but absolute bliss when you're in the mood for sushi and a myriad selection of Asian products.

They have a beautiful assortment of sushi, which is strangely made by Mexicans behind the counter. I am not sure how that jives with the Las Vegas crowds, but in the Northeast, usually sushi chefs are Japanese. Oh well, details.

They offer made-to-order plates, such as stir-fry lobster with noodles. I also really enjoyed their dessert selection. Green tea cheesecake is my favorite!"	3	Todai Restaurant	3.5
"Tops when it comes to buffeting in Las Vegas. I love all your Frenchie affair with your mussels, slices of tender meaty goodness, wide assortment of cheeses, and bread options. I wanted to steal your cream, sun-dried tomatoes pasta recipe. Alas, I learned if you love something, one must let it go. I am still counting the days until we shall meet again. 

Plus, I want to muzzle my hubby because all he talks about now is your strawberry shortcake. Actually, that's all I need to get in the mood."	5	Le Village Buffet	3
"I love coming here every time I'm in Vegas! 
Unfortunately, they changed their menu recently. 

I always get the Hells Kitchen Burger! It has a nice heat to it. I always have to share because their burgers are pretty big. 

Since they no longer have the gooey fries, I got the kettle chip nachos instead. They were a decent substitute, but still miss them! 

The fries are more like steak fries. They had the texture as if the fries have been sitting under a heat lamp. It was crispy but a strange crispy. 

Still coming back but I really wish thy bring back the gooey fries!"	4	Gordon Ramsay Burger	4
"Chicken tortilla soup was room temp which is never good unless it's meant to be cold.

Chile jalapeño burger was greasy and warmish.

Why is nothing served hot here?!?

Left with a bad case of indigestion.  I should've checked Yelp before eating here.  Save your $$ and eat somewhere else.  Unless you want to see what a restaurant is like before it dies."	1	Coconuts Beach Bar & Mexican Grill	2.5
"The Hell's Kitchen burger is beyond the best. We tried that one, the farm burger and the uber cheese. The Hell's Kitchen burger was super flavorful. I had only one bite and I wanted to steal the burger from my mother. The farm burger was decent. The duck fat made it moist. However, I am a saucy person so I had to use some of the sauces from the onion rings we ordered. 
I definitely recommend getting the gooey fries. They are beyond delicious. Just don't fill yourself up on that before your food comes! 
The beer battered onion rings are super crispy. Usually anything beer battered is a lot more heavy and dense but I love how the batter wasn't thick. The ketchup mix was delicious. 
We also had the sweet potato fries. It was sweet. The honey mayo was interesting but still delicious. I applaud them for making such good sauces. 
The only disappointing part is that you can see all of the kegs but there is no specialty beer. All the beer on tap is just like the typical bottled beer everyone serves. 
I already want it again after I just had it the other day."	5	Gordon Ramsay BurGR	4
Fun concept but the service was far below par. They are unenthusiastic and act like they don't want to b there. What a shame this could b a five star if they trained and oriented their staff correctly.	2	Topgolf	4

"Tldr: if you want to be treated like a human, don't come to this casino; so many better places that will treat you kindly 

This review is just of the casino's staff treatment:

I was walking through the casino with my parents to get back to their sister property, the Signature. My parents stopped by one of the machines and my mom wanted to show me something. One of the employees stopped me and this I didn't mind because ,granted, I do look young for my age and do look underage compared to others. But his attitude and the way he handled the situation appalled me. He was incredibly rude towards me and was basically accusing me of underage gambling even though we were just standing by one of the machines. He didn't even ask me for ID at first. He just kept questioning me about my age and when he finally asked for my ID, he didn't do so very nicely. When he finally verified my age by slowly calculating the difference between 2017 and my birth year, he just looked angry (probably because he was so excited to try and kick someone out of the casino). All he could say was ""Oh....you look really young..."" and then tried to leave hurriedly and threw a quick and angry ""sorry about that"" before running off quickly.

Look, I get it... minors try to gamble all the time and you're just trying to do your job. But you're in the customer services industry, at least try to be friendly. I was in Vegas for two full days and I was carded at multiple other establishments, but none of the other casinos handled the situation as poorly as MGM Grand. Rather, at other casinos, I actually struck up a friendly and fun conversation with the attendants who carded me and had a lovely time speaking with them. Honestly speaking, you should learn from your sister properties. They know how to do customer service right and well at their casinos!"	1	MGM Grand Hotel	3
We stumbled upon this restaurant and since the reviews looked pretty good we decided to give it a try. Which makes us the winners because this place rocks!!!

"Had dinner last night with the family and I'm giving them 4.5 stars for the service and the food.  The wait is rather long, that's why I gave it 4.5 and the food is a little pricey.  Our server was very attentive and always smiling whenever she comes to our table, making sure that we have what we need.  I ordered the Lobster carbonara.  It was very good, with lots of lobster meat (it's mostly from the claw).  They have big portions, so my daughter, my husband, and I have to bring home half of our food.  

I will go back to this restaurant because of the food and service."	4	Maggiano's Little Italy	4
"I had dinner with my teenage kids.  The restaurant is not busy at around 6:30 on a weekday. The service was just ok.
The food is good.  Although my salmon is a tad overcooked.  The crab cake saved my meal.  The crab cake has very little fillers, it 90% lump crab.  I love that in a crab cake.
I had the creme brulee for desert and it's mediocre.
The price is on the expensive side."	3	McCormick & Schmick's Seafood & Steaks	3.5
"My family wanted to try a new place with a 5 star rating from Yelp and we want sushi, so we ended up here in Soho.  We were seated right away. There were 3 of us in the party and we had the following entrees:
Yellowtail sashimi - the best that I've ever tasted. Even my daughter who is not a sashimi eater loved it.
Seared Tuna sashimi - very good taste.  
4 kinds of rolls spicy tuna, rainbow roll, twin dragon, and triple S - they are all good.  
We also ordered the 4 different tostadas that are very refreshing.
The Chef\/owner came to say hi and he gave us a complimentary salmon sashimi that has an interesting ingredient: pop rocks
Grilled hamachi kama is very fresh and flavorful with soy sauce and lemon dipping sauce.
The price is a little bit more than the other sushi house off strip, but the freshness and taste of the food is worth the money.  The service staff are attentive.  We will be coming back and we will be bringing some friends to experience the Soho Sushi."	5	Soho Japanese Restaurant	4.5
My family went to celebrate early Mother's Day.  As soon as we're brought to our table, I must say that we were pretty much given an excellent service.  Our water is always refilled and they give you fresh plate every time.  Minh was one of the servers that gave us a little more attention than the others.  He was Superb!  When it comes to the food, the chicken leg was a little dry. One of the gauchos came with rib eye steak, I asked for a medium and he gave me well done, other than that, the experience was very good.	4	Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse	4
I went there tonight for a take out and it took them an hour to finish my order, plus it took another 15 minutes to be bagged.  I saw my order on the counter ready for bagging, but nobody was minding it.  If I did not asked about my order, it will be just sitting there.  They also forgot to put dressing on my sashimi salad.   Hence, the 2 stars.	2	Oyshi Sushi	3.5
We went there on a Saturday morning and there were just 2 tables that were occupied.   They took our order right away.  I ordered a short stack of red velvet pancakes with strawberries and my husband ordered the breakfast burrito.  We got our food fast. The red velvet pancakes were really fluffy and delicious.  My husband's burrito were just ok, nothing really special about it.  While we were eating it got busier.   The reason why I'm giving them a 3.5 stars was for the time we waited for our check to come after I asked for it.  I saw customers  that were getting a little miffed while waiting for their food.  I still want to patronize them because they are not a chain.	3	Stacks & Yolks	3.5
We ate here last Thursday and all I can say is the service was excellent.  Food is a little pricey but tastes good.  I ordered the Winter 3 course menu. I had the clam and mussels appetizer,  trout for main course and the chocolate souffle for dessert. My husband had the hangar steak special and  my daughter had the roy's trio of seafood.  My husband's only complaint is that it's a little salty for his taste.  Overall,  it was a good dinner. They gave us one free dessert and 3 pcs of dumplings.	4	Roy's Restaurant	4
My family was craving for sushi last Saturday, and being Bonsai is new in this area, we decided to try it.  We tried their AYCE.  We tried some rolls. Hand rolls and nigiri.  The seafood they use looks fresh and no "fishy" smell.  We like that the fish to rice ratio is just right. Even the rice on the rolls are just a thin layer. So you can taste the other ingredients.  A bottle of Hana Sake is only $20, that's a plus.  The service is is very good.  The reason I gave it a 4 star is their menu for AYCE is not extensive like the other sushi place near me.  Their menu for ala carte is big but the AYCE is not.	4	Bonsai Japanese Steak & Sushi	4
As always, their food is very satisfying and the service is excellent.  We ordered Cowboy Omelet, cookie butter french toast and kalua benedict. It was spot on, comfort food at its best.	5	BabyStacks Cafe	4
We are visiting Las Vegas for spring break. We read the reviews online and decided to give this place a try. We were not disappointed! Took our kids and everyone loved their sandwiches. The Dutch crunch bread rolls, which they said are flown in daily, are yummy! Try the roast beef sandwich #17 or the turkey #18. Beyond really great sandwiches, the employees were friendly and the establishment was clean.	5	The Sandwich Spot	4.5
Burgers were melt in your mouth delicious!! I got the Ronin burger and bf ordered black & green. Of course I had a bite.. or 2 of my bf's burger.. What's his is mine right?? haha. Both were SOOOO good!!! Yum! Wish I had the stomach to eat every single burger in one sitting. Ox-trail chili cheese fries were too sweet for me so they were just okay. I'd just go back for the burgers.	5	Bachi Burger	4
Worst drive-thru experience, twice now! Last time early morning, no coffee at all! Today, after I ordered and waited in line, then got to the window, they said Cash only, I had none, got no apology they just kept doing business on headset and closed the window on me! Done with place!	1	McDonald's	2
"Eh. Just thinking of this place makes me sad :( So disappointed! I was sooo excited to try this place when I was in Vegas. Saw all the 4 and 5 stat reviews on Yelp and my friends told me this place is a must try!

This place is located on The Strip\/sort of near Circus Circus. Man the lines can be crazy long\/out the doors and they even have a security guard or whoever directing you where to enter and which line to stand in. Soooo my friend and I stood in the ""asada"" line since we wanted carne asada tacos. Man the wait was sooo long and sooo not worth it. And we ordered like 15 tacos and I'm still sooo sad we ordered 15 tacos and it wasn't even delicious (but of course I still ate it). Anyway, place is busy, and not a lot of seating. Pretty much you stand in line forever, order, and go to the other counter by the exit to pay and then sit down or take the food to go. Oh there's a salsa bar or something too. Overall, eh. I don't recommend this place :( I'll stick with Taco bell lol...k Sad4Lyfe"	1	Tacos El Gordo	4
They were late seating is, an that's the only negative! Awesome dinner for five. Would highly recommend!	5	Gordon Ramsay Steak	4
This place was terrible! I decided to be adventurous and try a new place, big mistake. I specifically asked for Mei fun, which is like angel hair noodles, they brought me fat, wide noodles. The house special had octopus, some bone or knuckle thing in it, scary fish, scarier pork, and some sort of chicken. Disgusting. Save your money!	1	Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant	2
What an awesome find! Cat themed, amazing drinks in huge sizes I think 20 oz or 32oz, and great service. It's not just a tea place. They do dessert and food as well! We stayed for hours because it was so welcoming. Their boba is freshly made and their attention to detail is wonderful.  This was my first time here and I'll be back again. I had almond jasmine iced tea with lychee jelly, peanut butter toast, and then we tried the popcorn chicken and sweet potato fries. It was all excellent.	5	Tea Space	4.5
Work view - lunch is so good! If you haven't been to pok'e pok'u go check it out! $5 lunch special - sushi burrito\/shu Mai\/ drink\/ miso!	5	POKE POKU  Hawaiian Poke bar	4.5
Love the southern cooking! Everything I have tried here is amazing. I'm partial to baby back ribs and wedge fries, my husband adores the pulled chicken and Mac and cheese. We have every birthday here, it is a great place in a nice location run by good people! Never disappointed!	5	TC's Rib Crib	3.5
I ordered house mei fun.it had lots of meat and was delicious. The place was fast and friendly. Will definitely return back and try some lunch specials. Thanks.	5	Grand Sign Kitchen	4
This was the most underwhelming Italian meal I've eaten since Olive Garden (once, never again). If you like lean cuisine, you'll love their overpriced offerings. $28 for lasagna - really- that was burnt and thawed out and bland. 6 ravioli for $26 in a tasteless attempt at vodka sauce (I'm Italian, I can say this) please - save your money and dine anywhere else but here. The service was lacking for the prices, I shouldn't have to ask for refills on drinks when my glass is empty. Awful. Someone tell the staff that tips match effort.	1	Panevino Italian Grille	4
I purposely mentioned when making my reservation that it was our anniversary and we would like a booth. The hostess walked us to a table way in the back, and when i mentioned that i had requested a booth, she got an attitude. I asked if we could wait for one to be made up, and she stated "i have one all the way up front by the door" and had some snarky remark yet again. Fine dining and hospitality? The food was outback quality at best. The filet literally tasted like a BK burger, and no one checked on us until we were half way through. Also, the table next to us was asked if they were celebrating anything. We were not, even though I mentioned it upon making the reservation.  So if you're celebrating something, hit the strip.	2	The Charcoal Room	4
"The drinks are freshly made and the customer service is fantastic! Lots of great fresh teas and even crepes! 
I'm currently enjoying a lychee slush and it is delicious! I would definitely recommend this place."	5	Brew Tea Bar	5
This place is fantastic authentic Mexican food! The chicken michoacan is delicious. Service was fast and friendly. Highly recommended!!!	5	Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant	3.5
This is our new favorite AYCE spot for so many reasons. The selection is fantastic. The sparkling sale is homemade (green apple is amazing) the desserts are on point and there's more than mochi. Also, they're open until 2am (Rainbow location). Amazing rolls, fresh fish, great service, nice music, and amazing appetizers. An absolute must try!	5	Oyshi Sushi	3.5
My go to at Wynn. Their orange beef is fantastic - reminds me of great NY Chinese food. They do a banana spring roll type dessert that is not to be missed ! Service is always fast and friendly. Give it a try, you'll be glad you did.	5	Red 8	3.5
I love love love this place! It's a great 60's diner, filled with authentic memorabilia and videos, as well as vintage games and books. It's our Friday night spot, for all you can eat fish and chips (my hubby is English and loves them) and UNO marathons! All the waitresses are excellent, shout out to the girls who bake fresh cakes and brownies. I adore Misti, she has helped me set up my mom's birthday party here the last two years. Give it a try, everything on the menu is delicious, from cheddar stuffed burgers to hot open turkey. I'm moving to Florida, and will miss this place !! Support small businesses , give this amazing hidden gem a try :-)	5	Rambo's Kitchen	3.5
So excited that they've opened right near my job. Love this place. Everyone is friendly. Malibu roll is awesome! Taro chips are in!	5	Jaburritos Sushi Burritos	4.5
As a former New Yorker , I am super picky with my pizza. This place was a surprising delight. I love being able to custom make my own pizza and pick all my favorite toppings. Sun dried tomatoes are amazing on pizza FYI.	5	PizzaRev	3.5
One of favorite places to get my kushi age cravings! Its a really good place to snack,drink ND socialize with your friends! Definitely recommend this place to everyone!	5	Yu-Yu	4.5
Finally found a new sushi place to eat for a late nigh grub! This place has a very nice atmosphere and I would say it reminded me of California feeling. The $25 ayce sushi ND tapas is very reasonable ND decent price for what you get! Very good quality and quantity. I usually don't give out reviews unless I fell in love with a place or had a bad experience, and this means is I ACTUALLY FELL IN LOVE WITH DOH! the sushi chef was very nice he made me the ala carte version of the squid nigiri and I loved it!! Thank you again! So if you guys are looking for something to eat after work at night there is DOH to serve you open til 3am everyday!! Maaaaaad props to them!	5	Yama Sushi	3.5
This is probably my favorite local steakhouse and butcher shop! strip quality food and service! My girlfriend and I always come here for mushroom fries, pork belly (that will melt in your mouth) with grits, very tender medium rare Spencer steak with the charred onion sauce!!! And we always get a pound of prosciutto at the butcher shop before leaving the restaurant; their prosciutto was perfectly cut thin almost see through! I can't wait to go back to dine in again, and also try their signature cocktails!	5	Echo & Rig	4.5
i think i found my favorite ramen place here in Vegas! Before it was Ramen Sora, now Jinya introduced me to a very delicious and flavorful broth! Ohhhh gosh when i had my first sip of the broth i told myself "this is my ramen bar" lol... The flavor was very balanced! It wasn't salty at all! I totally recommend this place to ramen lovers! The place was really cute and rustic and the service was very good! Please keep it up! I'm actually loving it! ;) also the good thing about this place they're open til 3am!!! Unlike other ramen places here closes so early! I can see industry people eating and drinking here after work. Thank you for the good experience jinya! ;)	5	JINYA Ramen Bar	4
"All i can say was DELICIOUS! i came in for lunch today with my parents 'cuz we were hungry for some viet food and it was perfect for a chilly noon time. I ordered the beef stew with french bread, crepe and egg roll for appetizer. They prolly have the best crepe and beef stew in town! And ooooohh goodnesssss the french bread was perfect!!!! It was hot, crunchy, and fluffy! From the first bite, it made me say ""daammn"" hahaha.. yes it is that delicious!! Also the crepe was perfectly cooked and very decent filling! I was really glad that it was not OILY! unlike the one at pho kim long it was soaking in oil (totally disgusting) but anyways the service was nice too! Fast and on point! 

So if you're looking for an authentic viet food in henderson this is a must go to place! And they also have another location at spring mtn. 

MUST TRY: beef stew with french bread\/rice\/noodles, crepe, and their viet hot coffee was delicious!"	5	Pho Saigon 8	3.5
"Finally! Shake shack opened their doors! It has a very nice interior and patio sitting. Its located between  outside of nyny and monte carlo, so its way better to park at nyny and go through the food court. 

Best burger ive had in east side and finally now here in vegas!!! I highly recommend the SHAKE STACK and second the SHROOM BURGER. i love how the cheese will oooooozzzeee out once you bite onto your burger, one word, BOMBDIGGITTY!

the service was really good and friendly!! keep it up guys!"	5	La Mojarra Loca Grill	4
Love this place I haven't had anything that I did not like. My hubby is very picky and this is a must stop every time we travel to Las Vegas! Family owned original establishment with food cooked just like at home.	4	El Sombrero Cafe	3.5
This was a very good dining experience. Having visited high end steak houses all around the world, I would say our actual food and drink experience at Craftsteak was delicious and the service very nice (with some gentle requests...a table not next to the service stand, and time to enjoy our pre-meal cocktail). All requests were honored, and the service and meal memorable. My only complaint...if we are dropping $500 on dinner, please do not run your vaccum until we have finished our after dinner cordial. I look forward to returning.	4	Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak	4
INSANELY delicious...trout...what?? Cannot even describe how good this was...Octopus salad...fabulous. Service fantastic. Thank you Michael...we are only upset because we didn't have time for brunch the next morning. Oh oh we must return!!!	5	Bouchon at the Venezia Tower	4
"This place was SUPER SUPER cute. It is a really authentic mob looking italian place. The food was prompt the service was good. There was a piano guy who was playing requests the whole time we were there. Only downside was that every time the waiter came up to me I totally felt like I was in his way because he was refilling my drink or removing my plate. He even moved my plate away from me when I was mid putting food on my fork!!!!!!!
But besides the overeager waiter the food was AMAZING!!!!!! The chicken parm was to die for and the bruchetta (Is that how you spell it?) was heavenly!!!"	4	Casa Di Amore	4.5
I'm not a party person, kinda a homebody actually. But I enjoyed this place a lot. The music was loud and fun, the atmosphere was great and the waiters were prompt. Not a bad experience in my book.	4	House of Blues - Music Venue	3.5
Went here for my Birthday dinner this year. IT WAS SO GOOD!!!! Really pricey but super yummy. Sad to say I was not overly impressed with the waiter service. It took a really long time to get water and refills even though we had one guy for our table only...Still I had a great time and it was very pleasant.	3	Charlie Palmer Steak	4
"I had the catfish filet and shrimp, it seems
they fry both together.. ugh . The hush puppies were so greasy and last but not least the fries looked disgusting I wouldn't taste them it looked like they picked them from the bottom of deep fryer after they had been there for a month .
Now Im just going to keep it all the way honest I check these reviews so I when I go to these places
I'm like people.. tell the truth cause that's twenty dollars I just wasted! So as a girl that likes good food don't waste you're money here.. I'm just telling you my experience."	5	Fish King Grill	4.5
It's super expensive, super stuffy, and just not worth it. Maybe we caught them on a bad night but restaurants who demand these kinds of prices shouldn't need a second chance, neither will they get one.	2	Twist by Pierre Gagnaire	4.5
"Ok. I have walked by this place a dozen times in the Crystal Shoppes and always just thought it was a mall restaurant. Surprises in Vegas keep on coming. I checked on Yelp and it was rated pretty high at 4.5 with 589 reviews. The final selling point was that it is open until 1 am which makes sense in Vegas. It is a pain to make it to a show and have dinner finished by 10 pm. A lot of the supposed higher end restaurants could do a lot better job on their hours in Vegas. Mastros does and so it got our reservation. We had a great dinner, the sea food tower was stacked and very well done. Everyone enjoyed their meals, the steaks and fish meals were great and not a complaint was raised at the table. The wine was recommended and reasonable. Not to mention very well paired to the meal. Thanks to Dion (our waiter), for a really enjoyable evening. He made the night work for everyone, even though it started off a little shaky. A bit more attention by the host staff when dropping people in the bar to wait on their table would have earned 5 stars. 

However, we would go back in a heartbeat."	4	Mastro's Ocean Club	4.5

"What else can I get for you?"" 
""How about the things I ordered ten minutes ago?"" 
This is my visit in a nutshell. If you have hours to kill and want to be served by the most moronic staff to ever grace a restaurant, then go ahead."	1	Tokyo Sushi House	3
The food isn't too bad and the price is right. But the service is painfully slow. The bartenders are not attentive at all.	2	Ocean One Bar and Grille	3
For an all you eat place the fish is very fresh. And they dot make the blocks of rice so big you fill up in ten minutes. I'm impressed.	5	Sakana	4
Service was exceptional. The menu is easy to discern to suit your individual taste. While I enjoyed the the food, atmosphere, and experience I wasn't as excited as other Yelpers.	4	Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining	4.5
"The tacos were awesome and authentic. Affordable pricing as well. It's a must stop!
Go support this independent business! You won't be disappointed! Yummy yummy food"	5	El Pollo Mobile	4

"Love this place! Everytime I come here from L.A I always make it a point to eat here. 

You have to eat the Loco Moco the best I've ever had and it's ""HUGE"" also the Kalbi is great also. I am a huge Hawaiian food fan and there's nothing like this in L.A!!!"	5	Island Flavor	4.5
"The food is simply amazing. A new spot that should not be missed by anyone who appreciates good food.
I signed up on yelp just to be able to review them."	5	Japaneiro	4.5
This is a great place to get quality Japanese food in Las Vegas in a relaxed environment, with excellent service. The menu can be a bit overwhelming with so many choices, but we had about 8 different plates and all were excellent, and the prices were definitely reasonable. I agree with other reviewers, the crips pork belly is an unexpected winner!	5	Izakaya Go	4.5
We loved Wazuzu!! The Decor was stunning, the food was perfect, and the service helpful and friendly. I would go back again tonight!	5	Wazuzu	3.5

"Waited an hour for my orders but glad Marcus, and owner Ted Mamola, came over and made it up due to busy 20 person party ahead of us. They comped a bottle of wine and desserts - that's great customer sevice!!

The review of the food itself is very good. We got the Tri-tip entree and the flat iron steak and they were awesome!

Would come back but not when huge party ahead!!"	4	Embers	4
"This place is everything! Food super hot!!! Just the way I like it! The urban mix sauce is the best! The catfish and gumbo was nothing shy of amazing! First time here and I will be back! 

-Andre"	5	Urban Crawfish Station	4.5
My favorite place to eat in Vegas. Worth the 10 min taxi off the strip. Order the guacamole and skip a major entree or share. You'll leave stuffed and having had the best time. Live music happens on the regular, the service is spectacular & the food is perfect!	5	Lindo Michoacan	4
"I had HIGH expectations coming to this place. EXTREMELY high expectations. For all the attention to detail and harsh criticisms that Scott has on Chopped, I anticipated a true culinary masterpiece. 

My girlfriend and I weren't that hungry, because we had already had an early dinner, but decided to give this place a shot because it was the only day that would have worked with our trip to Las Vegas. We thought the best thing to do would be to just order an appetizer and only one course each, as opposed to the traditional multiple courses with a true Italian meal. We ordered the short ribs as an appetizer, I ordered the spaghetti and my girlfriend ordered the roasted chicken.

The best part of the meal was the bread. You heard me. The BEST part of the meal was the bread. I must say, I had high hopes going in, higher hopes after the bread, because that was good bread. The focaccia was tasty, with the right amount of rosemary and well developed. It tasted fresh and airy. The other breads were also very good. 

We got our appetizer, and it was very small - which is usual for a good Italian place, since it's expected that you order multiple courses. This wasn't an appetizer though, it was basically an amuse-bouche. The ribs had good flavor, and the risotto was good as well, it good texture, but I would have liked it to be cooked a little longer - it wasn't crunchy, but it was still slightly underdone. 

Out come our main courses. 

My pasta is placed on the table, and the server removes the cloche. My first impression? ""This is a main course?"" I counted how many bites it took me to finish that pasta, and it was nine. Literally nine. It was such a small meal that I was still slightly hungry afterwards - even though I wasn't all that hungry coming in. And as for the flavor? I think Barilla pasta and Prego sauce tastes about the same, as long as you add some fresh basil, which was the only saving grace. But for $24, this was ludicrous. The pasta was just about al dente as well, so there was good texture. And as for the chicken? Horrible. Absolutely horrible. And small. I asked the server about the preparation, and he noted that it is brined with anise and some other flavors, which were conspicuously missing from the flavor of the dish. I ended up spending around $80 on just these three items, and definitely was left wondering why. Scarpetta gets the award for most over-promised, under-delivered food experience I've had so far. It was so bad that any time I see Scott on Chopped or any other show, I feel like he has no idea what he is talking about. Avoid this place, and go to Secret Pizza just down the hall instead - you'll save money, eat tastier food, and leave with a better experience."	2	Scarpetta	4
"Had a great day at the tables, so my friends and I decided to hit up Prime. Wow...is all I have to say.

I highly recommend the bacon wrapped shrimp, the truffle mashed potatoes and the porterhouse. The BEST mashed potatoes I've ever had."	5	Prime	4
Ordered take out to be delivered to my hotel after a conference I am attending.  The only reason that they get two stars instead of one, is that the salad was fresh and just fine and the garlic bread was okay.  However, the eggplant parmesan was HORRIBLE.  Overcooked, completely soggy, with soggy overcooked spaghetti.  I had ordered it in order to save half to take on the airplane for lunch on my trip home-- and instead, I threw it in the garbage.	2	Verona Pizza	3.5
I went here with a large party of 22 for my birthday. Jessica made it easy for me to make reservations online and communicated really well. Only thing about it that I wish I knew beforehand was that in order for your party to be seated, you had to have half of your party within a 15 minute mark. I wasn't informed of that, so my table was given up and had to fit at a table where 16 people only sat. Kind of hard, but my group made it happen. Overall, I had a great experience with the servers, people nearby enjoying the same atmosphere since we were seated in the main hall. Loud, but great since you can see everything happening and it was a lot of fun! I would recommend it to those who don't mind a crazy atmosphere!	4	Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas	3.5
"Never again!!!
2 1\/2 hours waiting with guestlist (we arrived at 10:15), unfriendly employees and a f**king overcrowded area! Ok it was tiestos birthday but it wasn't fun! You can't even move your ass...NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!"	1	Hakkasan Nightclub	2.5
"L'Atelier - does that mean ""the best butter"". Call me ghetto if you want, but one of the best things we had here was the french  Echir  butter. I could put this butter on anything and it would shine with pride. 

We went with one Prix Fix and many carte items to accompany. This wound up working really well for us and I'd recommend the strategy to others. 

Essentially every ting was great - langoustine fritter, tuna belly, gelee, suckling pig (oui oui), mashed potatoes (they are known for them and BTW they are like 35% ""butter"") and more. The beef rib eye was good, but the Poached baby Kussi oysters with French butter we the highlight for me - two orders please.

A more entertaining way to have a phenomenal meal..."	5	L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon	4.5
